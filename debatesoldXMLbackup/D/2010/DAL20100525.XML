      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>An Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I attended a meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the euro area in Brussels on 7 May.  The meeting was convened by the President of the European Council, Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, following the agreement reached by Ministers for Finance of the eurogroup on 2 May regarding provision of financial support to Greece.</P>
        <P>The meeting of Heads of State or Government of the euro area took place amid growing uncertainty and speculation in the markets.  At our meeting we took a number of important decisions in order to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole.  These are set out in the statement issued at the meeting.  I will mention the key elements briefly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">First, we agreed to activate the provision of funding support to Greece in a joint package with the IMF of &euro;110 billion.  Greece, for its part, reiterated its determination to implement an extensive programme of reforms.  Second, we agreed on the need for continued fiscal consolidation to ensure that targets are met.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case that means continuing with our plans to bring our deficit back to less than 3% by 2014.  Third, we reaffirmed our support for the European Central Bank in its actions to ensure the stability of the euro area.  Fourth, we agreed that the European Commission should immediately bring forward proposals for a European stabilisation mechanism to preserve financial stability, for finalisation by an extraordinary ECOFIN meeting on the following Sunday.  That has since happened.  Fifth, we decided that further measures to strengthen governance of the euro area, including strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact should be developed and agreed, in the context of the work of the new taskforce which the spring European Council agreed to establish.  Finally, we confirmed that we need to see rapid progress in the area of financial market regulation and supervision, and will return to these issues at the full European Council meeting on 17 and 18 June.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is an extensive package of measures and decisions, reflecting our collective determination to protect our currency and ensure financial stability in the European Union.  I have received a draft annotated agenda for the June meeting of the European Council.  The other issues scheduled for discussion are: Europe 2020 &mdash; A New European Strategy for Jobs and Growth; the G20 Toronto Summit; the UN millennium development goals; and climate change.  In addition, there will be a presentation by Felipe Gonzales, chairman of the Reflection Group looking at the longer-term issues for the European Union.  The meeting will also be asked to endorse the Council&rsquo;s conclusions on the evaluation of the implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Can I ask him to confirm that Ireland, despite what some commentators have said in the recent past, has no intention of leaving the euro?  Can he clarify whether the European Commission has suggested that the winding down of Anglo Irish Bank over a 20-year period should be contemplated or considered by the Government?  Has there been any contact from the European Commission in that regard?  In view of the comments of Commissioner Rehn, has there been any contact with the Government to the effect that further spending cuts should be imposed this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>These questions deal with what happened at the recent European Council meeting on 10 May and the agenda for the next Council meeting in June.  Anglo Irish Bank did not come up at either meeting.  I was asked about the European Commission.  The Deputy will be aware that the Van Rompuy task force held its first meeting last week.  It will furnish a progress report on the basis of the meetings it intends to have between now and the June Council meeting, at which the matter will be discussed further.  If the Deputy has examined what Commissioner Rehn said, he will know that the Commissioner was very complimentary <Col N="3"/>about the route Ireland has taken since these difficulties first arose.  Since then, we have received no formal or informal contact regarding our own plans.  We have been complimented as an example to be followed by others who find themselves in our position.  The question of accelerating fiscal consolidation according to national requirements has been particularly addressed to those who engaged in a fiscal stimulus in 2008.  Those who had an exit strategy for 2011 have been asked to bring that forward.  We did not have any room to manoeuvre in that respect.  Therefore, that did not apply to us.  The fiscal stimulus we have provided to the economy relates both to the level of spend engaged in but also the capital investment programme which remains approximately twice the European average.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commission has just published its proposals for banks to pay into a fund to ensure recent events that arose will not happen again.  Has the Taoiseach seen these proposals?  Will the Government support them?</P>
        <P>European governments considering their economic and fiscal positions are set on a trend of deficit reduction.  Will the Taoiseach agree that if this were applied by individual EU governments, it would not deal with programmes for investment in infrastructure which would make countries more attractive for job creation and investment?  At the June Council, will the agenda contain a serious investment programme for EU member states to stimulate growth, to create jobs and, thereby, grow European economies while governments take their respective individual actions in deficit reduction?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The primary means to establishing and maintaining growth in the European economy is to show determination in reducing deficits because public debt is far too large.  Unless this is done, then the prospect of capital being provided to Europe or it being seen as a good location for investment will be compromised.</P>
        <P>We have to see a consolidation in the public finances of all member states.  The financial markets have been volatile in this regard.  A determination by member states to address issues such as bringing deficits under control and public expenditure, which come under their control, is a critical factor in avoiding a strong rise in interest rates that would occur if such action were not taken.  That itself would be a major break in growth.</P>
        <P>The task force on economic governance at its first meeting set out four objectives to which Mr. Van Rompuy referred.  The first is the need to achieve greater budgetary discipline and not to provide for stimulus packages, which would strengthen and make the Stability and Growth Pact more effective.  The second priority is the need to find the means to reduce the divergences and competitiveness between member states, at least when these divergences are too large.  This is necessary for more even economic development in the Union and, in particular, the eurozone.  The third objective is the need to have an effective crisis management mechanism to deal with problems such as the current ones in the eurozone.  The fourth objective, linked to the third, is the need to strengthen institutional economic governance to act quicker and in a more co-ordinated and efficient manner in dealing with problems when they arise.</P>
        <P>The conclusions are not about providing further fiscal stimuli packages.  They are about the need to show a determination to consolidate budgets in the interest of member states and European growth.  Otherwise, the prospects of growth will recede.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>By any standards, this May has been an active month in respect of European economies and Europe&rsquo;s overall financial position.  Does the Taoiseach expect the June Council to review May&rsquo;s developments including the Greek package, the &euro;750 billion stabilisation package and some of the proposals from the Commission?  On 12 May, the Commission issued a communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the Central Bank <Col N="4"/>and various other organs of the European Union.  This was the document which raised concerns that individual member states would have to pre-submit budgets for evaluation by other Finance Ministers and the Commission in advance of being presented to national parliaments.  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s understanding of the status of this document?  Is it intended that the Council will consider it?  Where does the Taoiseach see the document going?</P>
        <P>What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view of the decision or announcement by Chancellor Merkel last week in respect of the banning of short selling and the ban on credit default swaps, which has caused a certain amount of unease in the markets?  Was any notification given by Chancellor Merkel to member states, including the Taoiseach, of her decision on the matter?  Does the Taoiseach anticipate that it will be discussed at the June summit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the activities that have been going on and when the next reporting mechanism is available.  It will arise at the June Council in terms of considering a progress report from the Van Rompuy task force deliberations on economic governance, which will be discussed.  There will not be a review of the decisions taken at the European Council or by ECOFIN subsequently in the sense that those matters will be reviewed.  That is our position.  The mechanism is in place and will be available should members states require it.  Obviously, everyone is striving to ensure that it does not become operational.  The Greek case was a particular issue that had to be dealt with separately, but the turbulence of markets has meant that wider confidence-building measures had to be communicated.  These emerged from the meeting of the European Council and, subsequently, ECOFIN.  They will remain in place and are not for review in that sense.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore asked about the status of the Commission document.  The Commission made its proposals on reinforcing economic policy co-ordination in its communication.  They form its contribution to the debate now taking place in the task force meeting and this has begun the process of discussion of all of these issues.  The communication had been planned for some time but it has heightened importance given the recent emergency commitments given to safeguard financial stability in the euro area in light of the budgetary crisis in Greece.  In view of the events of recent months, it is hardly surprising that the Commission would bring forward recommendations in this area.  Indeed it is clear that, notwithstanding the current crisis, economic and monetary union will entail both broader and deeper fiscal surveillance than in the past.  Exactly how that should be achieved is yet to be determined.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s document is a starting point for discussion.  It will feed into the work of the Van Rompuy task force, which the European Council agreed to set up when it met in March and which has now begun its deliberations.  It is important this next stage of work is carried out calmly, rationally and carefully without a rush to premature judgment or over-the-top reaction.  Much of the initial comment about the Commission&rsquo;s communication has been ill-informed or inaccurate.  Morgan has wrongly treated the communication as if it has already entered into force.</P>
        <P>We will participate fully in the discussion of the communication and the wider discussions on the financial stability of the EU and the eurozone, into which this communication now serves as a useful input.</P>
        <P>The Commission communication notes that member states need to pay down public debt faster than before, when times were better.  Easy credit, it stated, led to underproductive investment and excessive consumption.  Public debt has greatly increased since 2008 due, in part, to taking on financial sector liabilities.  The competitiveness differences that emerged in the euro area was one cause of the current crisis it identifies.  It also refers to the need to consolidate <Col N="5"/>to keep down long-term interest rates to boost growth potential, a point I made earlier to Deputy Kenny.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It proposes a number of elements, including greater effort to reach the 3% deficit and 60% debt Maastricht criteria and, possibly in the case of inadequate fiscal policies, interest bearing deposits that can be redeemed when targets are met and the withholding of Structural and Cohesion Funds for poor performers.  It recommends greater emphasis on the correction and avoidance of macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area. This could involve recommendations on competition policy, weight-setting behaviour, private sector credit growth and the European semester starting in 2011, so that budgetary and structural policies are peer reviewed earlier in the year, before rather than after as is currently the case.  This could, potentially, mean the recommendation to look at budgetary plans that it considers insufficient and a standing crisis resolution mechanism for the euro area involving strict conditionality, with assistance provided by way of above average interest rates.</P>
        <P>This document is a useful input to discussion.  It is not an end point in itself.  It is important that the next stage of work will proceed through the Van Rompuy task force procedure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I also asked the Taoiseach about the decisions and statement made by Chancellor Merkel during the week.  Perhaps he might return to that.  When he does so, will he state his view on the alarming statement by Chancellor Merkel that the single currency was facing an existential crisis?  I believe that was the term she used.  </P>
        <P>Connected with that, I saw a report in a Sunday newspaper suggesting that some Ministers were privately welcoming the weakening of the euro.  I can appreciate that changed exchange rates give our exports a competitive advantage but I was surprised to see what appeared to be authoritative and fairly direct quotations from Ministers in a Sunday newspaper regarding their views on the present value of the euro. Will the Taoiseach comment on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot comment on unattributed statements by anyone.  We need a more stable exchange rate.  It helps people to plan better and allows investors to make long term decisions.  It is a far better situation than the fluctuations we are seeing at present.  That volatility is not helpful.  It does not allow for orderly progress in developing trade and increasing prospects for everyone.  We want to see a more stable exchange rate situation develop.  That can best be achieved when the worldwide currency imbalances are rectified.  That, in turn, requires work at global G20 and other forums outside our direct control.  We are supportive of anything that would assist in bringing overall global stability and the prospects for world growth to be maintained.</P>
        <P>Chancellor Merkel was speaking of a matter that is within the remit of the German Federal Government itself, that is, how the rules of the German stock market were impacting adversely and in an improper way on German financial arrangements.  The question of stopping short selling is a matter for the German Government without reference to anyone else.  I was not given advance notice of the Chancellor&rsquo;s comments.  In matters as sensitive as this one would not expect advance notice in any event.  These are matters within the regulation of each domestic financial market.</P>
        <P>With regard to the other remark made by Chancellor Merkel, it is important that people read both the full content and context of what she had to say.  She spoke in the context of a political debate in the Bundestag, where she was seeing support from the German Parliament and taxpayers for collective action to support the euro.  She was making the point that the absence of collective action in these matters can lead to speculators seeking to identify weakness or diversity of opinion in order to destabilise the currency against the common interest.    She was emphasising the need for collective action.  Germany, as we know, is the main contribu<Col N="6"/>tor to the mechanisms that have been devised to assist the euro.  To portray Chancellor Merkel as in some way less than supportive of the euro is very wide of the mark.  There is obviously concern in Germany over the over the way in which German taxpayers view their country&rsquo;s contribution.  That is obviously a domestic political consideration that the Chancellor must deal with herself.  Germany and Chancellor Merkel have been very supportive of the need to act collectively on behalf of the currency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government reconsider its position of support for the proposal from the European Commission that draft national budgets be submitted to Brussels for scrutiny and peer review by other member states?  Surely this is a further significant erosion of sovereignty in regard to budgetary and other fiscal matters and only further centralises the institutionalisation of what have heretofore been the independently assessed needs of each member state.  As the Taoiseach knows very well, we warned against such developments in the course of the two debates on the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the Commission proposal will mean adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact and that this will outweigh the importance of citizens&rsquo; rights to health, education and decent employment?  Does he agree we will ultimately witness people and public services suffering more and that there will be further erosion of critical decision-making in regard to all these factors, as demonstrated recently, particularly in Greece?  Will the Taoiseach not reconsider the Government&rsquo;s position and regard what is now proposed as the thin end of the wedge leading to a serious attack on the sovereignty of Irish citizens?</P>
        <P>Will the Government not use its opportunity within the European Union to take to task, in a very serious and concerted way, the Israeli Government, the Israeli state, for the ongoing crimes against the people of Palestine for which it is responsible?  I have urged this previously.  Has the Taoiseach not noted the recent confirmation we have seen that the Israeli Government once sought to sell nuclear knowledge or weapons expertise to the then apartheid regime in South Africa and that the circumstances of the Israeli state give rise to real concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this culminating in a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The second focus of my two-part question concerns why the Government supported so enthusiastically Israeli membership of the OECD.  Does the Taoiseach not believe that is a golden opportunity to bring to task on the international stage the outrageous record of the Israeli Government and state?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with one of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions, the one relevant to the questions tabled, which concern what was decided upon at the last European Council meeting and the agenda for the next one.  I fundamentally disagree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s analysis that the proposals for the better co-ordination of economic policies represent in some way a diminution of our sovereignty.  We live in an era of interdependence.  We have taken on obligations as well as rights in joining the single currency and great benefits have derived to the country from the establishment of the euro and our membership of it.  The biggest impetus for economic advancement in this country over the past 25 years was the establishment of the Single Market and, the follow on from that, which was the establishment of a single currency in which to trade in that market.  For a country like ours, which exports 95% of what it produces, anything that improves our access to those markets and avoids the transaction costs of converting from one currency to another and the improved and increased transparency that provides for pricing greatly outweighs any disadvantages.</P><Col N="7"/>
        <P>The other premise of the Deputy&rsquo;s question was that peer review is new and is to our disadvantage.  In a single currency area of 16 independent sovereign states, the need for co-ordination of economic policy is fundamental.  The establishment of the European Central Bank has been fundamental.  I ask the Deputy to contemplate in the context of the crisis we have been seeking to manage over the past two years where the resources would reside in this State to meet the resources we have been able to obtain from the ECB in dealing with the funding mechanism and the funding requirements of this economy over the past 24 months.  If we had our own currency, does he suggest that in the aftermath of the international financial crisis we would have the resources to withstand the impact of that?  I am afraid he is totally mistaken if that is what he believes.  The unfortunate example that we have of Iceland should remind him of the importance of avoiding isolation in the matter.  If one was to take the Deputy&rsquo;s analysis, it is probably a greater guarantee of the loss of sovereignty than the retention of it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a need clearly within the auspices of the Stability and Growth Pact, which was revised in recent years, to have situations where pre-emptive or preventative measures can be taken rather than subsequent corrective ones.  Where excess deficit procedures at the moment offer verbal and written warnings and ultimate sanctions, they may well prove too late, particularly when one has had the impact of the financial crisis on public debt that every country has had to contend with as a result of what we have seen in the past number of years.</P>
        <P>If, as I agree, it is also about the need to maintain public services on a sustainable basis, one cannot put forward a sustainable case for the retention of public services if one is running deficits of 10% or 12%.  One has to bring one&rsquo;s public finances back into order to protect public services to the greatest extent possible and to provide a means by which in better times in the economic cycle we can once again, as we did in the past, greatly increase resources in the context of personnel, material and money for these services.</P>
        <P>That is my strong view about seeking to portray this as a loss of sovereignty.  It is a fundamental fact that we share sovereignty in many areas as a member of the EU, much to the advantage of the country.  Any objective analysis of how the country has developed, regardless of the problems we face now, is that our best prospects are as part of an integrated European economy rather than seeking to suggest that a free trade area between independent sovereign states will provide us with the prospects or opportunities we have obtained in the past and we hope to create in the future.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with the premise that lies behind the questions.  The objective evidence does not support the contentions made.</P>

	<P>Only in the fullness of time when we shall see the outcome will the Taoiseach come to accept the fears that I have expressed in this regard, which are shared by many people.  This is not about the euro, as much of his response suggested, but rather about the matter I raised, namely, the European Commission requirement now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>The Taoiseach did not respond at all to the second matter I raised, although the question referred to the recent Council meeting and the forthcoming meeting.  I asked whether the Taoiseach would not use the opportunity afforded the Irish Government to raise the situation in relation to the Israeli Government&rsquo;s behaviour in the Middle East, namely, its continued aggression towards the Palestinian people, and will he&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In conclusion, is the Taoiseach prepared to join this Deputy in commending Members of this House who have embarked today on a flotilla, a rescue mission, to the people of the Gaza Strip, leaving the shores of Ireland?

	<P>The issue of Israel and Palestine will not be raised at the next Council meeting.  It is not on the agenda and it was not discussed at the last Council meeting.  For those reasons, I believe this is irrelevant to the questions before me. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has the opportunity to put this on the agenda. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="9"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just explained that the agenda has been outlined.  The Foreign Ministers deal with issues relating to the Middle East on an ongoing basis.  It was envisaged when Mr. Van Rompuy took over the job that perhaps, at one of the European Councils during the course of the year, part of the meeting would be devoted to some foreign policy issues.  I presume it would arise in that context, as part of an agreed agenda.  When a President of the Council is appointed to run and set the agenda for the Council, this or that will not arise under &ldquo;any other business&rdquo;.  That is not the way it works, but there are other Council formations where those issues are a continuing part of the agenda.  Questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to where any of those dossiers lie at the moment, will elicit the appropriate information, but this is not relevant for these questions.  To suggest that it is, is disingenuous. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a serious matter.  The onus is on the Taoiseach to raise the issue, but he has refused, repeatedly. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just explained to the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, please allow the Taoiseach to speak, without interruption. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just explained to the Deputy.  In an effort to be helpful, of course we wish the return of both Deputies to the House after their journey to Palestine.  Of course we all commend the work of all organisations, NGOs, governments and others who are assisting the people of Gaza on an ongoing basis.  They are enduring tremendous hardship, particularly in the aftermath of the attacks that took place there some time ago.    The House is united in expressing that sentiment.  However, it does not mean the subject is relevant to the questions we are dealing with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government considered the moneys given to Anglo Irish Bank to be an investment, but the European Commission reclassified it as spending.  The Government recently stated that it might be necessary to put a further &euro;10 billion into the bank over the coming years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This sounds like a question for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I know, but it is to do with the reclassification of the Government&rsquo;s contribution to Anglo Irish Bank as spending rather than investment.  The Government recently said it might have to give another &euro;10 billion to Anglo.  Given that the Commission has already classified such a transfer as spending, what are the implications for our budget deficit if a similar reclassification occurs?  Does the Taoiseach consider this to have implications for Government budgetary strategy in terms of further spending reductions or taxation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I respectfully suggest this is a supplementary question not contemplated by the questions tabled.  It is unfair on other Deputies who stick to supplementaries that are relevant to the question for me to answer questions that are not within the purview of the questions tabled.  It only encourages people to decide to ask whatever supplementaries they wish regardless of the question being discussed.  I do not wish to be discourteous.</P>
        <P>I will not enter into speculation on the specifics of the matter, but I will address the general point about the reclassification of the moneys that were provided to Anglo Irish Bank.  The markets have factored in that this is a once-off payment to the bank; it is not a recurring item on the accounts of the Government.  In other words, this year it increased the deficit, but it is not a recurring part of the deficit.  Markets take this into account when they consider our underlying deficit.  When the reclassification occurred, it did not have an adverse effect on the <Col N="10"/>Government&rsquo;s status in international bond markets because it was understood for what it was.  However the transfer is classified &mdash; whether it has the original intended classification or the new one &mdash; it obviously adds to the overall debt.  The fact that it was reclassified meant it became part of the deficit equation, but it is not a recurring part of the deficit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Taoiseach&rsquo;s point that the markets do not regard this money as part of our recurring deficit.  What is his understanding of how the Commission views it in terms of the targets we must meet to bring the deficit back to 3% of GDP?  It is the Commission&rsquo;s intention to include the money given to Anglo Irish Bank and other banks as part of this calculation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I am making is that the money that was paid into Anglo Irish Bank, which was part of our deficit this year, will not be part of the figure next year.  It was a payment to the bank for this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>What if there is another payment next year?  Will that be included in the calculation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the Commission that insisted on the reclassification, so it understands the implication in terms of its addition to the current deficit figure.  However, it also accepts that it is a non-recurring part of the deficit.  It is a question of where it goes in the accounts.  The underlying point is that we hope to reduce the deficit to 10.5% or 10.75% this year.  Moving into next year, the Commission will want to see whether there has been a &euro;3 billion adjustment.  That is the underlying point the Commission has made, that if there are further payments or where they are reclassified, they would be dealt with in the same way.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>  the amount that will be identified for savings within his Department in view of the instruction by the Department of Finance that departmental cuts of &euro;3 billion must be identified within a month; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[21935/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Government is keeping the current and prospective budgetary position under constant review in the context of its medium-term economic strategy. In that regard, the Government will consider in the coming weeks various possibilities for savings that could be advanced in budget 2011.  As part of its preparations for that, the Government has decided that each Minister would identify possible savings within his or her remit and advise the Department of Finance of these by the end of this month.</P>
        <P>In identifying possible savings I will seek to protect the vulnerable irrespective of age. The main objectives of the Government medium-term strategy are to assist economic growth and job creation through a restoration of competitiveness; to prevent the general Government debt rising to unsustainable levels; and to restore expenditure and taxation to more sustainable levels.</P>
        <P>As part of the strategy, it was announced in budget 2010 that the Government intended to make a further adjustment in current Government spending in 2011 of the order of &euro;2 billion. <Col N="11"/>In addition, it is also intended to make adjustments in capital spending in 2011 of the order of &euro;1 billion.  Capital spending, estimated at just over &euro;10 million in 2010 for my Department, forms a tiny fraction of the nearly &euro;21 billion overall expenditure and of capital expenditure generally.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently engaged in the process of identifying a menu of initial options for structural programme savings in 2011.  This process will also have regard to the outstanding recommendations of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes.  The options identified will, in turn, be considered by Government as one element of its deliberations on budget 2011 over the forthcoming months.</P>
        <P>It is important to stress that, at this stage, no decisions have been taken either by me or by the Government in regard to changes in social protection schemes and services in 2011.  Rather the options which will be identified by my Department will be designed to assist and inform the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the next budget.  The sustainability of public finances is crucial for all and I genuinely believe that the Government must take steps to reduce overall public expenditure and restore stability to the public finances if we are to avoid the risk of making the economic situation far worse for everyone in society.  This includes the recipients of the various schemes and services operated by my Department.</P>
        <P>The Government has already made difficult decisions in this regard and the next steps towards recovery will require further such decisions.  At the moment, I am engaged in an intensive round of consultations with a wide range of welfare representative organisations and I am listening carefully to their views.  In an uncertain international environment, my priority will be to ensure that the overall Government strategy is advanced and to protect those most in need in a manner which is sustainable in the years ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>My question was more specific than the Minister&rsquo;s reply suggests.  I asked him to indicate the amount of savings he expects to be identified for his Department.  Of the &euro;3 billion in savings for which the Minister for Finance has asked, what specific proportion has been asked of the Department of Social Protection?  If he has not been given a specific figure by the Minister for Finance, is he drawing up a list of proposed cost-saving measures, or how is he going about it?  In short, has the Minister for Finance specified that X amount must be cut from the social protection budget or is it up to the Minister for Social Protection to come up with his own proposals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a preliminary identification of various options which will then be examined and costed.  These will be the subject of discussion between me and the Minister for Finance and, later in the year, the Cabinet will go through all these options before final decisions are made.  The amount of money to be saved by any Department will be decided collectively by the Cabinet in the run-in to the budget.  It is early days in the process and I am currently considering the savings to be made in various areas.  At this stage there are no specific proposals on exact savings to be made.  That is not the way it is done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said his priority is to protect the vulnerable irrespective of their age.  However, recent comments of his, which he has not rowed back on, have raised concerns, particularly for pensioners.  He has since provided some clarity in this regard but people remain genuinely worried.  In the context of the budget for social protection, will the Minister indicate the categories of persons he considers the most vulnerable?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am looking at all the data and taking into account such issues as consistent poverty.  Later this week I will meet with a broad cross-section of voluntary groups dealing with the elderly, lone parents, the unemployed and so on.  Arising from all those dis<Col N="12"/>cussions that will continue month after month, I hope it will be possible to arrive at a consensus in terms of the issue I highlighted, that is, the need to protect the vulnerable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Who are the vulnerable in the Minister&rsquo;s view?  He has criteria for vulnerability and some are more vulnerable than others.  Who does the Minister believe are the ones that he must protect?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is that there are people on very low income in all age groups who are vulnerable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>When one examines the data one will see this spans across all age levels.  Those on the lowest amount of money are very vulnerable.  I want to examine all of the data, have a continuing dialogue with all of the different groups, listen carefully to them and not make decisions on the hoof in May but try to have as much information and discussion to ensure I am well informed when the Cabinet discusses these issues later in the year.  That will ensure that whatever decisions we must make will be made in an informed and sensitive way and that we make a particular effort to protect those who are vulnerable.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>  the reason for the delay in finalising full details on the PRSI incentive scheme for employers; and the way he intends to proceed </Quest>
        <QRef>[22002/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The employer job, PRSI, incentive scheme will be commenced in June and will be administered by the Department of Social Protection.  Regulation or secondary legislation pertaining to the scheme is in the final stages of preparation, as are details of scheme administration. </P>

        <P>The scheme will run for the calendar year 2010 only.  However, any qualifying employment created in 2010 will be eligible for the scheme, which will be structured so that employment created prior to the launch can participate for 12 months forward from the time of launch and employment created later in the year will participate for 12 months to the corresponding date in 2011.</P><Col N="13"/>
        <P>To qualify for the scheme the employment will have to constitute an increase in the employer&rsquo;s employed workforce above that applying in the three month period immediately prior to the date of commencement of the additional employee, who will have to have been on the live register for six months or more.  In addition, participation in the scheme will be limited to 5% of the employer&rsquo;s existing workforce or five posts, whichever is the greater.  The employer will also be required to declare when applying that the employment will be for, on average, 35 hours or more per week.  These conditions are designed to prevent displacement from existing full time and part-time positions.</P>
        <P>The scheme has not been launched to date as the regulation and administrative arrangements are being put in place. These arrangements are now close to completion and I expect to be launching the scheme in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>In this context it is important to note that jobs created prior to the launch will still be able to benefit from the scheme.  For example, in the case of a qualifying employment created prior to the launch of the scheme standard employee and employer PRSI will be paid but, following approval for the scheme, the employer will benefit from a PRSI exemption for 12 months from their date of approval.  Rebates of PRSI will not be a feature of the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s response, and his performance regarding this issue, is not good enough.  This scheme was announced in the budget in December and here we are, five months into the year, and not a single job has been provided under this scheme.  Over a week ago I asked the Minister&rsquo;s Department for details of this scheme, what had been done to promote it and how it would operate and it has still to come back to me with any response on that.  Can the Minister tell us the reason this scheme was announced in December and five months have already been lost in regard to setting it up?  We have more than 430,000 people on the live register.  It would seem the Government has been so obsessed with the whole issue regarding the banks it has taken its eye off the ball in terms of job protection and job creation.  Why is it that nothing has happened in the past five months regarding this scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I have said that I hope we will have the scheme up and running within the next month.  As I have already explained, anybody who has created employment within the terms of the scheme will be able to apply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am saying that people who have already created employment will be able to apply and they will get the exemption from the date of the launch of the scheme.  I am anxious to get this scheme going and I agree with the Deputy that it is urgent.  I have asked my Department to ensure that we progress the scheme as quickly as we can and I hope that we will have it up and running within a month from now.  I will do my best to ensure that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is all very well for the Minister to say it is urgent but his actions and those of his predecessors would indicate that no urgency is being attached to the issue of jobs within the Government.  Funding has been provided for this scheme since last December.  There is the potential for 12,000 jobs to be created yet the Minister has not taken any action to set up or promote this scheme.  It is fine for the Minister to say that employers can avail of it in retrospect but he has done nothing to promote this scheme.  There is no process in place for making application.  There has been no promotion of it.  I want the Minister to tell us how an employer should go about applying for this scheme.  What are the rules that will guard against job displacement and so-called deadweight?  Has the Minister discussed those issues with employer groups, and will he give consideration to involving Enterprise Ireland in overseeing the scheme to avoid the possibility of job displacement?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="14"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy about the displacement and deadweight.  That was one of the reasons for the delay because the officials in my Department had to ensure that when they were drawing up the regulations we would not create either displacement or deadweight.  Deadweight was a problem with a previous scheme, and we are taking steps to avoid that.</P>

        <Quest>  the action he is taking <Col N="15"/>to assist persons who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  </P>
        <P>There are 52 independent MABS companies operating the money advice and budgeting services from 65 locations throughout the country, with national support provided by the MABS NDL.  In addition, the MABS national telephone helpline is available from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday to Friday, and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at <i>www.mabs.ie</i>.  Last year an additional 19 money advisers were recruited by MABS between September and December, bringing the number of MABS staff to over 270.  The additional advisers have been appointed to MABS companies throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The money adviser works out a budget and negotiates on behalf of the client with all creditors, including financial institutions and sub-prime lenders, to secure better terms for the client in managing the repayment of their debts.  Where required by the client, the money adviser can assist with setting up a special account with a local credit union into which the client lodges an agreed amount of money regularly and from which each month the money adviser makes the repayments to the creditors on behalf of the client.</P>
        <P>It is important that people coping with debt difficulties take early action and approach MABS for help and guidance.  This can be the first positive step for people in addressing debt difficulties.  I am satisfied that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service is providing a high quality service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s answer worries me if he thinks that MABS is the only solution to the debt crisis.  It is part of the answer but it is not the whole solution.  The Government has done nothing in terms of enforcing debt procedures, regulating debt collection and providing any sort of new system of personal insolvency.</P>
        <P>Has he any idea how many mortgage advice cases the 52 independent MABS companies have dealt with and what the success rate has been?  There are almost 30,000 people in arrears and 250,000 in negative equity.  What caseload is MABS carrying?  What is the average waiting time for a face-to-face appointment with MABS?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a detailed question arising from a general question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the Minister&rsquo;s reply, not my question, that concentrated on MABS.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand the average waiting time is four weeks.  Meetings are prioritised and if there is a need for a more urgent appointment that is also considered.</P>
        <P>There are protocols agreed with the Irish Banking Federation.  It agreed to approach debt problems experienced by the clients.  The objective is to agree affordable sustainable repayment plans for people with debt problems.  It includes a commitment that no legal action will be taken as long as there is compliance by the client with an agreed repayment plan, which is mutually acceptable, affordable and sustainable.  This is being monitored to see how well it is working.</P>
        <P>There is then the issue of those who are not covered by the Irish Bank Federation.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="16"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that there are discussions taking place to try to extend the protocol to other major groups such as credit unions and utilities and that they are also discussing this issue with one of the sub-prime lenders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a lack of urgency in this regard.  Arrears are growing by the day.  People are getting further and further into debt and the response is not dealing with it.</P>
        <P>The Department has a role here in terms of mortgage interest supplement.  There is a review that has been ongoing since I came into this position opposite the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  We are spending &euro;70 million on this.  Effectively, the Department is handing this cheque to the financial institutions.  They are now telling customers to seek a mortgage interest supplement and then they will re-negotiate.  When will the review on mortgage interest supplements be completed?  Approximately one third of cases are being refused.  We do not have definite figures from the Minister.  We need the review so that we can have a real discussion on how this operates and link that in to the overall debt issue.  When will we see that review?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that the review needs to be brought to a conclusion.  I would also bring to Deputy Enright&rsquo;s attention the Cooney committee, the special committee set up to look urgently at the question of indebtedness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I met with that committee.  I am aware of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I met with Mr. Cooney also and my Department is part of it.  My understanding is the committee is to report next month.</P>
        <P>I agree that this is probably one of the most urgent issues that I must deal with as Minister.  The Deputy can rest assured that since I came into the Department, I have put a great deal of time, effort and emphasis on the need to move forward with viable proposals to deal with all of these issues.</P>
        <P>Looking at the statistics, a large number of the clients of MABS are in rented accommodation.  These are not all mortgage holders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Only a small number of those with a mortgage problem are going to MABS.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>They do not feel they are able to get all the advice they need because MABS is not resourced to give them that extra sort of advice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully agree there is need for urgent proposals on how we deal with debt problems.  One of my big concerns is that often I find where there are mortgage problems there are a great many other debt problems on top of them and dealing with the mortgage in isolation is not the solution.  Having spoken to many of the people involved in MABS as I go around the country, they also bring that to my attention, that it is a complex problem and we must come up with a comprehensive solution to deal with debt problems and as far as possible, through agreements, protocols and new systems, to avoid it going to litigation.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>  if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties self-employed persons experience in claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance under the current system; if he has any plans to reform the PRSI system in order that self-employed persons can benefit from adequate support when they become unemployed or when their business fails; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[21937/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Self-employed persons pay PRSI Class S contributions which provide cover for long-term benefits such as State pension and widows or widowers pension.  Employees are covered by PRSI classes A, E, H and P, which provide cover for the above benefits as well as for short-term contingencies such as jobseeker&rsquo;s and illness benefits.</P>
        <P>PRSI coverage is related to the risks associated with employment or self-employment, the annualised system of contributions for self-employed persons and the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments.  Self-employed persons pay class S contributions at a rate of 3% per annum as compared to the 14.75% full class A contributions paid by employees and their employers, to reflect the narrower range of benefits they receive.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</P>
        <P>A self-employed person who has paid insufficient class A contributions may instead qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is a means-tested payment and, in assessing a person&rsquo;s means, account is taken of all income which the person may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year.  In general, the person&rsquo;s means will take account of the level of earnings in the last 12 months in determining the person&rsquo;s expected income for the following year.  In the current climate account is taken of the downward trend in the economy and it is accepted that future earnings may be lower than those of previous years.  The process also recognises the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers.  Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context.  Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two strands to the question, how to deal with the persons who were self-employed who now find themselves in a position where they no longer have employment and then to look at the PRSI contributions to ensure that down the road more self-employed persons do not find themselves in this position because they paid only the class S rate.</P>
        <P>To deal with the more immediate problem, no doubt the Minister, like myself and all our colleagues here, is dealing with this every day.  There is a significant number of persons who were self-employed who suddenly find themselves with practically no entitlements on losing their jobs.  The Minister has mused over the past two weeks in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> on some of his views in this regard.  He spoke of his new scheme, the employer job initiative scheme.  I understand it is the one to which he referred in the articles, although it is not clear <Col N="18"/>all of the time because we do not have the detail.  The Minister seems to think that the skills among those fully qualified self-employed persons are most suited to this scheme.  Can he explain how the scheme will work to particularly help that category of person?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Enright is correct in stating that there are many self-employed persons who did not understand that they were not covered, for example, for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, until the employment dried up.  There were many in the construction industry who never thought the work would cease, particularly those with trades, and suddenly they find themselves in a situation where they are not entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Many of them who have partners or spouses also find themselves in a situation where they are not entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  That is something Deputy Enright and I have encountered.  They are not covered.  They have not paid the contribution to be covered for unemployment benefit, it is a clear statutory position.  On the other hand, there is a pool of talent that could do considerable work in providing services to the community.</P>
        <P>There is a model in terms of farmers.  For farmers who have low incomes and self-employment, there is farm assist, but there is also the rural social scheme where they work in the community and provide services in return for which they get a fixed payment.  None of these functions has transferred to my Department and therefore the situation of setting up schemes is something for the future.  The Deputy has identified a challenge and we must see how to deal with that challenge.  There is no question of giving them rights to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit because, quite simply, they have paid 3% on the self-employed contribution and this does not entitle them to short-term benefits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, the Minister has not answered my question; he has just elaborated on my question.  The Minister stated in interviews that he regards this new scheme as being particularly useful for people who formerly worked in the trades and in the construction sector to facilitate them in gaining employment.  How will this scheme specifically help the category of formerly self-employed people?  My question is specific.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, legislation is required to transfer the legal powers to deal with these matters.</P>

Obviously it will be required to go to Cabinet.  I do not have the legal responsibility at the moment but I am sure the Deputy agrees that this is an issue that needs to be tackled because there is a significant challenge for self-employed people at the moment.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>  the reason a distinction is now being made as regards the payment of PRSI at Class S rate, between those in retirement who purchase an annuity to draw down income and those who do likewise by using approved retirement funds; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[21938/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Approved retirement funds or ARFs are funds managed by a qualifying fund manager into which an individual may invest the proceeds of his or her pension fund on retirement.  The income and gains of such funds are exempt from tax within the fund.  Any amounts withdrawn from an ARF are referred to as a distribution.  A distribution is treated as income from an employment.  It is subject to income tax and the fund manager must operate the PAYE system on it.</P>
        <P>Under social welfare legislation any payments received by way of pension are not regarded as reckonable emoluments for the purposes of self-employed pay-related social insurance.  However, unlike annuity products, ARFs are not pensions but are treated as assets.  As such, distributions from ARFs fall within the charge to self-employed PRSI.</P>
        <P>There has been no recent change in legislation pertaining to this area but my Department recently clarified to qualifying fund managers that, as the legislation stands, they are required to apply the appropriate PRSI when making distributions.  In this regard it may be noted that only distributions made before pension age will attract the charge to PRSI, as social insurance only applies to individuals between the ages of 16 and 66.</P>
        <P>My Department, working with the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Pensions Board, is currently engaged in a review of ARFs and the interaction between PRSI and pensions in the context of the national pensions framework.  This review will have particular regard to the necessity to achieve the correct balance between ensuring that the social insurance fund is supported by contributors and providing incentives for people to save for retirement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask the Minister a direct question.  If the two of us retire at 65 years and we receive our payment from our pension fund, and the Minister decides to purchase an annuity and he draws down &euro;20,000 a year and I decide to put mine into an ARF and I draw down &euro;20,000 a year, does it make sense to him that he does not pay PRSI whereas I do?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I do not have any private pension fund so the direct question does not apply to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I did answer it because the Deputy spoke about himself and me.  I tried to answer the question.  The Deputy has raised an issue that has validity.  There are, I understand, other&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is that as the legislation stands, they are required to apply the appropriate PRSI when making distributions.  </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="20"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance set up this system whereby people were given an alternative as to whether they would purchase an annuity or else put the money into an approved retirement fund and draw down their income from that.  The main difference, from the State&rsquo;s point of view, is that the State is guaranteed for all time, so long as the fund remains in place, and PAYE is paid on all of the income taken, right down to the day there is no income left.  This is compared with an annuity where tax dies when the person dies and this could be after five or six years.  Therefore, the State gets more PAYE from an ARF than from annuities.  I am asking the Minister a straight question.  Can he tell me who on God&rsquo;s earth decided only recently in a circular from his Department that ARFs are not pension schemes and are instead retirement funds?  Withdrawals from ARFs are liable for PRSI at Class S.  What benefits does a person get paying Class S contribution from the Minister&rsquo;s Department if he or she is being asked to pay when in retirement and receiving an income which is fully taxable, as is the same with annuities?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The second issue I would like to elucidate is that I am informed we are bound to charge this under the present law as it is.  The Deputy asked me who introduced this provision.  It was brought in by Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not charged up to this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Apparently, it is still legislatively bound to be charged.  I cannot change the legislation without bringing it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Minister&rsquo;s interpretation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy I never put legal interpretation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>When I refer to the Minister, I mean his Department as he represents the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>But it is a legal interpretation, therefore, the Department informs me we are bound by law in this regard.  If the Deputy wishes, I will ask my officials to double check whether we are bound by law.  I do not have any great feeling on the matter one way or the other.  We are examining the issues fully with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance and that is the best way forward in the circumstances.  I know the Deputy has strong views on the matter.</P>

	<P>The Minister asked about someone who might retire at 63.  If the Minister retires at 63 he can equally get an annuity as easily as an income from an ARF.  The point I am trying to put across to the Minister is that if A draws his income from an annuity, he is not asked to pay PRSI.  If B draws an income from an ARF which is exactly the same as it is a fund, the same as an annuity is a fund, one is now being asked to pay PRSI and one gets no benefits.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>They may look the same but there is some slight legal difference.  I know the Deputy feels very strongly about this matter and he raised it in the Seanad with the Minister for Finance.  I will have it double checked from a legal perspective.  I want to be helpful on the issue.  If the double check shows the law is as it is, we will try to see where we go from here.  I want to ensure there are not other consequences because there will always be a thin line between what is pension and what is income from earned income.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 84 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current Government policy in regard to pensions is laid out in the national pensions framework which was launched in March of this year.  The framework includes a number of changes to the State pension in order to make it more transparent, simple and equitable for those reaching pension age.</P>
        <P>From 2012, social insurance credits will be introduced for people who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  This will replace the current homemakers disregard and will assist people, particularly women, to qualify for a contributory pension or a higher level of payment.  In addition, from 6 April 2012, and as provided for in legislation since 1997, the minimum number of paid contributions required for State pension (contributory) will increase from 260 to 520.</P>
        <P>From 2020, the way in which eligibility for State pension is calculated will be simplified.  Specifically, there will be a switch from the way in which pensions are currently calculated over the average working life.  Under the new system, the level of pension paid will be based on the total number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.</P>
        <P>A person will need to make contributions for 30 years to qualify for a maximum pension.  Once a person has the minimum number of paid contributions required, he or she will accumulate 1/30th of a pension for each year of contributions up to a maximum 30 years.  Upon introduction of the total contributions approach, the maximum number of credits that can be used for pension purposes will be set at 520.</P><Col N="22"/>
        <P>Recognising that people are living longer and healthier lives, the Government has also decided to amend State pension age in three separate stages: in 2014, the State pension transition will be abolished.  The effect of this will be to standardise State pension age at 66; in 2021, the State pension age will be set at 67; and finally, in 2028, State pension age will be set at 68.</P>
        <P>For those who wish to postpone drawing down their State pension, arrangements will be put in place to enable them to receive an actuarially increased benefit when they decide to retire.  In addition, for those with contribution shortfalls at pension age, arrangements will be put in place to allow them to receive additional benefit at a later date if they continue to make paid contributions for pension purposes while remaining in work or self-employment.  An implementation group for the National Pensions Framework has been established by my Department and this group will work through the relevant issues in implementing the measures contained in the framework.</P>
        <P>Social welfare changes for 2011, including any changes to State pensions, will be considered later this year in the context of next year&rsquo;s budget preparations, having regard both to needs and to the resources available to meet those needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that his recent comments, in which he failed to rule out the possibility of a cut in the State pension, have caused widespread anxiety and concern among pensioners across the country?  Is he prepared to give an undertaking that he will not target pensioners for cuts again, given that several cuts impacted on pensioners last year?  Is he prepared to give an undertaking that he will not interfere with the entitlement of people who have contributed to a contributory pension scheme throughout their working lives, and that he will not move to introduce means testing of that State pension, given that people have already made those contributions to qualify for that pension?  Can he provide those assurances to the many pensioners who are really worried following his recent comments?  Is he prepared to make that statement today?  Does the Minister accept that when it comes to making savings in the pensions area, he is barking up the wrong tree?  He should be targeting people at the high end of the private pensions industry, rather than those on State pensions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>My answer was in response to a question about a budgetary issue.  I am concerned that the remark was misinterpreted by people in a certain way.  I gave the standard reply that I give to any query about the budget before the Budget Statement, that is, it is not in my power to pre-empt my Cabinet colleagues on any budgetary issue.  Therefore, if the Deputy asks me any specific question about what the Government might or might not do in the budget, I cannot answer her in May.  I gave a generic answer, as I have to do in these cases.  That is because it would be wrong to start answering specific questions before Cabinet discussions on any budgetary issue.  I regret that when I gave what I thought was a generic answer &mdash; one that a media person, who is an ex-Minister, would understand perfectly as being the only answer that a Minister could give in the circumstances &mdash; it was not taken at face value.  At this stage, it is not for me to make any comment on what might or might not be in a budget.  I understood that would be taken as being the way we ought to operate. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister gives the impression that he turns up at Cabinet meetings to discuss the budget and brings the entire Estimate for the Department of Social Protection, which is then gone through line by line.  Is it not the case, however, that he will bring to the Cabinet his recommendations for cuts in his Department?  Is that not the reality of how it will happen?  The Minister for Social Protection will bring forward suggestions, which will then be discussed and decided collectively by the Cabinet, as distinct from Cabinet members going through it and asking, &ldquo;Could you save a few quid here and there?&rdquo;  Is that not the case?  The Minister is concerned about the media&rsquo;s interpretation of his comments, but have the media <Col N="23"/>interpreted those comments incorrectly?  Have Opposition spokespersons misinterpreted the Minister&rsquo;s comments?  Is he not going to touch the old age pension?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Unfortunately, the Deputy is again trying to get me to give some specific commitments one way or the other on the budget.  As I said, however, there is a long time to go between now and the budget.  I will not in any way pre-empt any Cabinet discussions or any Government announcement on the budget.  Therefore, no matter how often or how persistently people ask me what I will do concerning the budget, the same answer will be given, that is, they are all decisions to be taken by the Cabinet.</P>
        <P>In my experience we will look at all the parameters in great detail.  Last year, we had a large number of meetings before the budget and because the Department of Social Protection accounts for one third of total expenditure, a lot of time was spent on it.  My colleagues all have a big interest in it.  We are greatly concerned to protect the vulnerable, which is the important thing from our point of view.  The matter is a very complex one.  We also understand &mdash; I believe the Deputy&rsquo;s party agrees with us on this &mdash; that unless we meet our fiscal targets the sustainability of any future budgets will be put at risk.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not agree with how the Minister addresses that aspect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be differences on how we might proceed but we must adhere to what we said in the 2010 budget and must work within that framework. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is the Minister for Social Protection and for that reason it would be helpful if he provided assurances for those who are dependent on the State pension that he will not target them again this year.  The Minister said earlier that he was looking at all options.  I asked him if he was barking up the wrong tree when it came to making savings in the pension area.  Is he prepared, for example, to examine high-rollers who can have pension pots of &euro;5.5 million?  Is he prepared to examine the possibility of making cuts in that area, rather than targeting people who depend on the State pension?  Equally, will he look at the current situation that allows widespread tax evasion by employers, as there is no limit to the contributions they can make to the pensions of company directors?  Those are two areas where the Minister could make savings in pensions.  Will he give an assurance that he will consider making savings in those areas, while at the same time providing some assurance to those who depend on the State pension?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to provide an assurance to those in that segment of the social welfare budget who are over 66 and depend on social transfers but I must also look at pensioners, the unemployed, those with disabilities, those in receipt of domiciliary care, child payments and so on.  I must also examine the issue of consistent poverty, including vulnerable pensioners, those with disabilities and the unemployed.  What we must try do is to frame the budget in such a way that nobody is asked to bear a burden he or she cannot bear.  Deputy Shortall asked me other questions but they relate primarily to taxation.  I will be part of those discussions on the budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 39, 46, 49 and 75 together.</P>
        <P>The national average processing times for jobseeker claims decided during April were 2.33 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and 6.92 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  This compares to processing times of 2.12 weeks and 7.10 weeks respectively in March.  Processing times can be affected by the requirements of the schemes such as a means assessment or it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.  I have made available to the House a table showing the processing times at each local office during April.  The total number of jobseekers awaiting a decision on their claim at 15 May was 45,505.  This is a reduction of more than 7,000 compared to the figures one month earlier on 10 April 2010 and represents 9% of the total jobseeker claim load nationwide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputies will agree that over the past year or more we have made significant efforts to reduce processing times and the number of claims awaiting a decision.  The national average processing times are very close to the targets of having 90% of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claims decided within three weeks and 90% of jobseeker's allowance claims decided within six weeks.</P>
        <P>As has previously been said in the House, when we look back over several years when the live register was at its lowest, there was always approximately 9% or 10% of claims awaiting a decision.  The current performance should be seen in the context that in 2009 alone, local offices received over 670,000 jobseeker claims and so far this year they have received more than 200,000 claims.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have also made available to the House a table showing the breakdown of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, JB, and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, JA, claims awaiting a decision at each local office.  These data have been compiled from data that are maintained on a local office catchment area basis and these figures do not correspond exactly with county boundaries.  The House will be aware of the particular difficulties presented due to the huge rise in unemployment in the past 18 months or so and the pressure this has brought to bear on the network of local and branch offices and in the inspectorate.  To alleviate some of this pressure since May 2008, some 450 extra staff have been assigned to local offices, new central support units and to the Depart<Col N="26"/>ment&rsquo;s inspectorate.  At the same time the Department has been examining all procedures surrounding the claim acceptance and decisions process with a view to streamlining them and achieving greater efficiencies where possible.  These initiatives include the introduction of an appointment system whereby customers can have their claim taken and decided during the appointment.  This particular initiative has helped greatly in reducing waiting times and improving processing times.  This system is in operation in 38 local offices and there are plans to extend it to further offices.</P>
        <P>There is now a more streamlined procedure for customers moving to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance when their jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit expires.  There is also a streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous two years.  The Department has the application forms for the jobseeker schemes on its website, which means that anyone who wants to make a claim can print the form at home and bring it to the local office completed.  This helps to reduce queuing times.  It is now easier and more straightforward for customers to supply evidence of their identity and address.  The Department has also simplified processing methods for some customers who work casually, part-time or on systematic short-time work.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the importance of getting claims decided as quickly as possible and I assure the House that staff in local offices and in the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate are doing all they can to ensure that claims are processed as quickly as possible.  There are still some offices where processing times and claims awaiting a decision are not as good as we would like.  We will strive to reduce processing times and the number of claims awaiting a decision even further where we can, either through streamlining processes and procedures further or through the introduction of new technology to assist with claims processing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister described the context to us of where we are and where we were.  It is very difficult to deal with a couple before one in a clinic who cannot pay their mortgage or ESB bills and whose telephone has been cut off, who cannot afford to clothe and properly feed their family because they are waiting for their application to be processed.  One cannot just tell them that due to the unemployment situation being worse they will have to expect to wait a bit longer.  One needs to have a feel for the position in which they find themselves.</P>
        <P>The Minister has told us half the story.  The questions relate to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  What about the length of time it is taking for appeals?  What does the Minister intend to do to address that?  The average time taken to assess an appeal for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and means is almost 23 weeks and more than 18 weeks for the rest of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
        <P>The average waiting time is not seven weeks everywhere.  There is a continuing problem in the social welfare office in Edenderry which happens to be in my constituency.  This is my fifth Question Time to ask the Minister about the Edenderry office.  The waiting time there is still 14.5 weeks.  Why are the schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of specific questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;not working there?  Deputy Feighan will probably raise the same matter of difficulties in the Boyle office.  The Minister is failing utterly to tackle the problem in specific areas.  What does he intend to do about that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy about the importance of ensuring that people get answers as speedily as possible on social welfare claims.  As Deputy Enright is aware, it is also important and it is a big help when people provide all the information requested urgently.  In the same way as Deputy Enright, I have often dealt with cases in my office which involved helping people to get the necessary paperwork together in order that the claim could be dealt with.  In the specific case outlined by the Deputy, I remind her that a supplementary welfare allowance is available for people in urgent need while they wait for a decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>How can that be paid out in a week by a community welfare officer who still has to be fairly sure that the claimant is entitled, yet it can take a significant length of time to make an application through the Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a discretionary payment.  I understand a relatively small number of people applying for payment get supplementary welfare.  However, it is available.  We must have a discretionary system in place that can provide a quick answer on a short-term basis but obviously the issue of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is a longer term one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister still has not given the information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, the payment of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or benefit is a longer-term issue.</P>
        <P>I will comment on the appeals issue even though it is not the subject of this question.  One of the other questions that have been tabled is about this issue.  I am concerned about the length of time it takes to deal with appeals.  I assure the Deputy that the response to the other question will make it clear that I am taking specific action to try to deal with the appeals backlog.  I agree with the Deputy that the backlog of appeals unfortunately means that this process is taking an unacceptable length of time.  I am dealing with that.</P><Col N="33"/>
        <P>I was asked specifically about Edenderry.  An additional social welfare investigator was assigned to Edenderry last October.  However, the inspectors in Edenderry have no premises that is suitable for desk interviews.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many empty buildings in the town that could be used.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Consequently, almost all jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims involve an at-home visit.  This has had a severe impact on processing times in this area.  The OPW recently advertised for accommodation in Edenderry.  This will improve customer service by providing accommodation for two welfare inspectors and a facilitator, thus providing a facility for desk assessments rather than home visits.  The OPW is currently evaluating responses with a view to securing suitable accommodation as quickly as possible.  That issue is being dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Approximately a year ago, I raised the unacceptable length of the waiting list in the Boyle area, where people were having to wait for up to 19 weeks to have their cases dealt with.  Has that problem been alleviated in the past few months?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If a specific question on the matter were tabled to the Minister, he may be able to assist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>We have asked general questions as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the information in respect of Boyle, unfortunately.  I will get an answer for the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The average figures are fine.  I have to acknowledge the progress that has been made in that regard.  Difficulties continue to exist in certain areas, however.  Can the Minister tell us what the longest waiting time for the payment of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is?   The main problems seem to be in the branch offices, rather than the local offices.  I do not know if the Minister agrees.  Has he considered devising a particular strategy to deal with the branch offices?  Now that additional staff have been taken on, can the Minister tell us whether he believes the full complement of staff has been reached?  Is he looking for additional staff?   There is a concern that the diversion of staff into the processing of claims means the Department is not as active as it should be in terms of fraud detection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not active where it should be active.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know of any requests for extra staff.  I will double-check that.  I was also asked about the longest time for a claim.  A table that will be circulated sets out the relevant time in each office.  I have to say that in my experience, cases in which claims are not dealt with for a very long time often relate to people not providing information.  Therefore, it is not always a measure of the efficiency of the office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is it worse in some places than in others?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What office has the longest waiting times?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The list I am circulating will provide that information.  It takes 12 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to be processed in Blanchardstown, for example.  It takes just 1.72 for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to be processed there.  We will have to deal with offices with long delay times.  If it is a question of individuals with long delay times&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we are talking about offices.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="34"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay.  There are offices with waiting times of two weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Boyle?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will circulate a table providing the information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>A quick perusal of the table shows that there is a waiting time of 12 weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has given an answer in relation to Boyle.  He does not have the information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>He does have the table.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I have the table here.  The waiting time in Boyle for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is 3.08 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and 8.74 weeks in the other case.  It does not have the longest waiting time.  I did not realise it was in such a handy format here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>It has improved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The waiting time for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in Blanchardstown is 1.72 weeks.  It is 12.49 weeks in the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not acceptable that people in the Blanchardstown area have to wait three months to get jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What action is the Minister taking to deal with that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not just because they are filling the forms in wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have said, a great deal of work has been done on the global scheme to deal with delays.  I agree that we have to keep working with a particular focus on areas where there are unacceptable delays in processing claims.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What does that mean?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can be absolutely sure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>

	<P>Can I ask the Taoiseach to state the number of children who may have died in the care of this State in the past ten years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will know that on 8 March last, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs announced the establishment of an independent review group on child deaths.  The group presently comprises Ms Norah Gibbons and Mr. Geoffrey Shannon.  It has been asked to examine existing information on all deaths of children in care over the past ten years.  It will produce an overall report for publication which includes, on an anonymised basis, key summary information regarding each child and the circumstances leading up to his or her death.  The review will focus in particular on the relevant involvement of State services with the child and his or her family.  It will examine the strengths and weaknesses of such involvement.  The group will make recommendations on how child protection responses can be strengthened.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware that the validation of the numbers of children who have died in care is taking place at the moment.  That remit is being extended to include children who had been in care but were out of care and requiring after-care services when they died, and to children in respect of whom the Department or the HSE were notified of the need for child protection.  The exact and precise numbers are being worked on and through at the minute.  The HSE has confirmed that 23 is the figure it is putting forward at the moment.</P><Col N="36"/>
        <P>It is important to point out that the Government met this morning.  It is anxious to ensure that the work of Mr. Shannon and Ms Gibbons proceeds as they would envisage and to provide whatever information they require to achieve the publication of a report, as set out and agreed with the Minister.  We are arranging for that to happen.  A meeting of officials from the Department of Health and Children, the Office of the Attorney General and the HSE took place today to clarify the position with regard to any obstacles to the provision of necessary information to the review group.  That is being worked on today as well.</P>
        <P>I want to make the point that we will do whatever requires to be done.  In relation to the report itself, any information required by Mr. Shannon and Ms Gibbons will be provided.  The legal obstacles that may exist in that regard will be dealt with by means of a legislative change, if necessary.  I believe a legislative change will be required.  That will be prepared as a matter of urgency.  An exercise is being undertaken with regard to the separate issue of the validation of the numbers.  The HSE has indicated to the Minister that it should be ready by the end of June.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am astonished at the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response.  He is the Leader of the Government and political leader of the country.  This information was promised to Deputy Alan Shatter on 5 March 2009.  The Taoiseach himself is a former Minister for Health who supervised the introduction of the Children First child protection guidelines in 1999.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has a dysfunctional Health Service Executive, HSE, and a Minister of State with special responsibility for children and youth affairs who is powerless.  The Minister for Health and Children, sitting beside the Taoiseach, and her predecessor, Deputy Martin, and their Ministers of State were unable to acquire information about children who may have died in the care of the State.  It is astonishing that the Taoiseach, himself, a former Minister for Health, does not have this information accurately.  We have the Department of Health and Children and the HSE hiding behind process and reports.</P>

	<P>It is strange that Deputy Shatter, or reporters Paul Reynolds and Edel Kennedy, are able to produce more evidence about children who may have died while in the care of our State than the HSE or the Department of Health and Children.  It is truly astonishing the Taoiseach does not have that information and cannot answer the question.</P>
        <P>A review group has been appointed by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It comprises Ms Norah Gibbons and Mr. Geoffrey Shannon whose integrity no one doubts.  However, there is a legal problem with giving the information and documentation on these children who may have died to the review group.</P>
        <P>The HSE also refused to give accurate information on problems with X-rays at Tallaght hospital, breast cancer treatment in Portlaoise and information on charges for elderly people entering nursing homes.  Now, arising from this debacle, one of the most monumental failures of the State, will the Taoiseach agree the HSE is dysfunctional?  Will he agree that the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, is just a decoration at the Cabinet table?</P>
        <P Just="Left">When will the Taoiseach give us the accurate information?  Will he introduce legislation, if it is necessary, to overcome the obstacles created by the HSE in this regard?  Is he prepared to accept responsibility for this situation and see it is sorted out, because the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, has patently failed to do so?  This is a matter of life and death in which <Col N="37"/>it is now reported that up to 200 children may have died while in the care of the State.  This information was to be given to Deputy Alan Shatter arising from a D&aacute;il debate on 5 March 2009.  I find it incredible that in a matter as sensitive, important and subjective as this, the Head of Government does not have accurate information on it after all this time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to be forwarded to the review group so that it could deal with the matters he outlined to it.  The HSE has advised the Minister of State that it will take it until the end of June to complete an accurate and consistent list of deaths of children in care in that respect.  That is the information that is available to the Minister of State and its work is ongoing.  I agree I would rather have that information to hand immediately.  The collation and recording of this information is not what one would have expected but that is the situation.</P>
        <P>On the separate matter of ensuring the provision of whatever information is required by Mr. Shannon and Ms Gibbons, in discussions between departmental officials, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the HSE after the Government&rsquo;s meeting this morning, it was decided the HSE would provide factual information requested by the review group as a matter of urgency and no later than Friday of this week in respect of previously identified deaths of children in care known to the HSE.  To allow this exchange of information between the HSE and the Department, the sharing of which might otherwise be legally restricted, a legislative amendment is required.  That amending legislation will be brought forward as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to Deputy Kenny is quite incredible.  It is incredible the State is not in a position to tell us how many children have died in tis care.  This is not about asking the HSE how many medical card applications were made in a period.  This is about the deaths of children while they were in the State&rsquo;s care.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated the HSE believes the figure is 23.  An article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, however, stated the HSE believes approximately 200 children have died in State care in the past ten years.  There is a big difference between 23 and 200.  If it is as high as 200, then it is an extremely serious matter.  The average mortality rate for children in the total population was 300, that is one in every 3,200 children.  If the number of children dying in care is as high as 200 in the past ten years, an average at 20 per year, then it works out ten to 12 times the mortality rate in the wider population.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach tells us he does not know the number of children who have died in State care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have a question please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach does not know why these children died because the inquiry established under Norah Gibbons and Geoffrey Shannon has not yet been able to get the relevant files.  The HSE, which has responsibility in this area, is thumbing its nose at the Minister of State, by claiming the files will not be provided.  The Taoiseach now is contemplating new legislation.</P>
        <P>Why can the Minister for Health and Children not give the same written direction to the HSE, as provided in the Health Acts, to produce these files as she gave for the release of lands from hospitals to enable the building of private hospitals on them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should not be hiding behind the review group.</P>
      </Speaker>
     <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible to give a direction which is contrary to the law.  There are legal problems which need to be addressed.  We want to ensure the review group&rsquo;s objective set out by the Minister of State, that is an independent report which would deal with the question of the deaths of children in care over the past ten years.  It is not, however, possible, to give a direction if there are legal constraints under the Child Care Act.  There is also the fact that proceedings in the cases in question are held <i>in camera</i> and subject to court order.</P>
        <P>These issues can be addressed, we believe, by providing a specific legal basis on which this information should be shared between the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  That was the Government&rsquo;s view this morning when the Minister reported to us on the work of the review group.  The Government was of the view this morning that whatever legislative changes are needed to overcome any particular legal issues that arise will be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  The House would be united on that issue.</P>
        <P>I refer to the question of the numbers.  As I have stated, the HSE has informed the Minister that it wises to validate and get an accurate and consistent list of the deaths of children in care over that period.  It seeks to have this finalised in the coming weeks having checked all of its files.  I do not suggest this is something with which I or the Government is happy.  One would have hoped it would have been available immediately but that is not the case.  Therefore, we must get a validated list and we must get the facts together, collated and brought to the attention of the review group, along with the information required by the review group to examine the circumstances surrounding those deaths, whether by natural causes or otherwise.  These matters need to be addressed.  This is why the Minister of State has instigated the measure.  Since January of this year there have been new arrangements because the Minister of State <Col N="39"/>has been to the fore.  He wishes to bring more transparency and to put in place a more effective situation.</P>
        <P>At present there is a situation where HIQA is notified within 48 hours of any deaths and there is a 15 person panel, from which three are chosen to independently investigate the circumstances and whether child care provisions are working in each case.  There has been a new system from January onwards which will deal with situations which have arisen since then.  At the same time the Minister of State, in the aftermath of Ms Fay&rsquo;s situation, asked for a review group to examine cases in the past ten years of people who died in care and he is arranging to get that now.  We will take whatever legislative measures are necessary, based on the advice of the Attorney General, to ensure the information is made available to these respected persons in this area, Mr. Shannon and Ms Gibbons, to complete this work satisfactorily.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would have thought that information on children dying in the care of the State would not take the State agency responsible months to compile.  It should be at the top of the agenda.  I am reminded of what the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, stated here on 4 March when we were discussing the Tracey Fay case.  He stated that he was guided by the principle that the State should act <i>in loco parentis</i>, not just in the limited understanding of the Latin phrase in the legalistic context, but to truly take the place of the parent and to provide support to the most vulnerable children in the State.  He referred to acting <i>in loco parentis</i>.</P>
        <P>Whatever the State has been doing in the case of children who have died in its care, it does not appear to have been acting <i>in loco parentis</i>.  If any set of parents acted as negligently as the State would appear to have acted here, to the extent that the Taoiseach does not know the number of children who have died in the State&rsquo;s care, the State would move to take those children into care from the parents concerned.  What happens to children for whom the State does not provide the care that should be provided by parents?  That is the issue to be addressed here.  An issue of State negligence arises.  The extent of the negligence is such that the Taoiseach is not even in a position to advise on it and he is awaiting some validation exercise that must be undertaken by the HSE before he can inform us of the number of children that have died in the State&rsquo;s care in the past ten years.  Clearly, this is a case of negligence, dysfunctionality in the HSE and of the tail wagging the dog as far as the relationship between the HSE and the Minister of State with responsibility for children is concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not correct.  I have just made the point three times to the Deputy that the Government this morning decided on whatever legislative changes are required.  Legal issues are involved.  It is not a question, as Deputy Gilmore is seeking to portray, of people thumbing their nose or whatever.  There are legal issues involved in this question and they must be resolved.  The Government decided this morning that they will be resolved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did it not decide as much one year ago?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever information is required by Mr. Shannon and Ms Gibbons to enable them to do their work will be undertaken as a matter of urgency.  A Bill will be brought to Government, approved and brought into the House as soon as is practicable to enable that to happen in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Issues exist which must be resolved and they can be resolved once a legal basis is provided for interaction between the Department and the HSE to take place in such a way that information can be shared.  We will do that.  All of us are anxious to ensure that is the case.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore raised a point in respect of the number of people involved.  I do not know any more than the Deputy from where the figure of 200 people emerges.  It may be the case that people have extrapolated it on the basis that, unfortunately, there have been six deaths in <Col N="40"/>the past quarter or since January, and such people may have devised a mathematical conclusion from that for the past ten years.  Perhaps then one could come to a figure of that order.  However, I am unsure whether that is a fair presumption to make and it is not one that should be made.  I agree I would rather have the exact figure available to give to the House today.  However, during the past ten years and under the old health board structure these matters were dealt with at various regional levels.  I agree this information should be available to us forthwith.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 32, I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the lack of communication in relation to the hours and remuneration of home help providers in the Inchicore-Ballyfermot area and the impact this is having both on providers and clients of the service.  A number of weeks ago, the service providers were told by letter that &ldquo;due to cuts in funding imposed by the HSE we are forced to implement drastic cuts in the home help service with effect from 6 April 2010&rdquo;.  There is an urgent need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the situation regarding the funding that will be available and the hours that will be provided to the clients who depend on this service.</P>

	<P>It is proposed to take No. 8, motion re referral to select committee of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the terms of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; No. 9, motion re referral to select committee of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the terms of three interim economic partnership agreements; No. 10, technical motion re further Revised Estimates [Votes 26, 31, 34 and 35]; No. 20, Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Order for Report, Report and Final Stages; and No. 4, Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill 2010 &mdash; Order for <Col N="42"/>Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 8, 9 and 10 shall be decided without debate and any division demanded on No. 10 shall be taken forthwith.</P>
        <P>Private Members&rsquo; business shall be No. 36, Electoral Representation (Amendment) Bill 2010 &mdash; Second Stage, and the proceedings on the Second Stage thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 26 May 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed that No. 9 be taken without debate, and I would like to give the reason for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please bear with me for a moment, Deputy.  I will put the proposals to the House and you may make a brief comment then.  There are two proposals to be put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 8, 9 and 10 agreed to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Taking No. 9 without debate would be outrageous.  We have been down this road before with regard to economic partnership agreements, but these three agreements have not been discussed in African parliaments.  With regard to the first of the three, which deals with the Southern African Customs Union and the Southern African Development Community, there has been a specific attempt by some countries to come together on 18 June.  Today is Africa Day.  These three agreements affect hundreds of millions of Africans. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, you may not discuss the matter in detail.  I will allow a brief comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  We have been down this road before.  This process was used previously when agreements were referred to a select committee.  I will attend the select committee with a couple of others, we will debate them inadequately and they will then be rammed through.  They affect the right of Africans, for example, to put taxes on extractive industries that are robbing their countries.  They require more than 80% reduction in relation to tariffs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A detailed comment is unnecessary at this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is, because we insult ourselves and our foreign policy in this way.  We are correctly proud of our policy on aid and on the relief of hunger, but we contradict it comprehensively by ramming through these agreements without discussion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please co-operate with the Chair, Deputy.  You are refusing latitude on the Order of Business.  It is entirely inappropriate to make a Second Stage speech.  There will be other times to raise this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no other times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have allowed you to make a brief comment but not licence for a Second Stage speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not making a Second Stage speech.  I have said why the first interim agreement is inappropriate.  The second one deals with eastern Africa and the same thing applies.  Let us be clear about what is appropriate and inappropriate.  Ten out of 47 <Col N="43"/>African countries have signed these agreements.  This is the imposition of old, failed policies on African countries that can ill afford them.</P>
      </Speaker>
     <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, you are out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not out of order.  How am I out of order?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>You are making a Second Stage speech.  There are so many other ways to raise this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no other ways.  What you would like is that they would drift off to a select committee with about three of us in attendance and hundreds of millions of people, for a decade, pay with their lives, their exports and their right to livelihood.  It is a time for ending the hypocrisy of contradicting our aid and hunger policy by ramming through these agreements that are not properly considered. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, will you give way to your party colleague?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish now.  They should be considered by plenary session in this Chamber.  We should not compromise.  The African countries are holding their meeting on 18 June.  Today is Africa Day.  Let us have a debate on these agreements.  Then they can go to any select committee the House wishes.  Let us not use the select committee as a cover for absence of transparency and morality in our foreign policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am now putting the question.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, I indicated my intention to speak some time ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend calling you later on the Order of Business.  I have noted your name and it is my intention to call you. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak on this issue.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Very briefly, Deputy Durkan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no other ways to raise this matter, as Deputy Higgins has pointed out.  In support of what he has said, I ask that a full and open debate take place in this House.  The matter may be referred to a select committee thereafter.  Perhaps, at this stage, a useful intervention may well be made by Members of this House in their own right and with their own knowledge.  Can that be facilitated, a Cheann Comhairle?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully concur with the arguments presented by Deputy Higgins.  It is scandalous that this is being kicked to the sidelines, where scant attention will be paid to what is at the core of the propositions involved.  It has to be done in this Chamber, openly and transparently.  I fully support his objections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise a point of order.  As three Members of the House have asked for a debate on this issue, it is appropriate that the Government respond to those requests before you put the question, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="44"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are asked to approve the terms of the interim agreements as soon as possible.  All other member states have signed them and the European Community is anxious to implement them in order to ensure compliance with World Trade Organisation rulings.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>They go much beyond the WTO requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is expected that this will be dealt with by the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs.  We have been asked to put the agreements forward for approval.</P>
        <P>I can undertake that the matters can be debated in the House when they have been dealt with at committee.</P>

	<P>Last week the T&aacute;naiste was unable to give a clear answer in respect of legislation necessary to deal with information given to the review group looking into the question of children who may have died in the care of the State.  I find it strange that the HSE, which is responsible for the delivery of services in accordance with the policy laid down by the Government and the Minister for Health and Children, has legal problems transmitting information and documentation to a review body set up by the Government.  We have gone down the road of bureaucracy to an enormous extent.</P>

	<P>Deputy Neville has raised the question of mental health and the strategy, A Vision for Change, on many occasions.  The programme for Government indicates <Col N="46"/>a revised plan that can be implemented in respect of this strategy will be published in 2010 and the question of moving the Central Mental Hospital to a new site will be progressed.  What is the position in so far as that element of the programme for Government is concerned?</P>
        <P>I am concerned by what is happening in the horseracing industry.  The Taoiseach has an interest in this and, on 13 May, he indicated legislation would be introduced to incorporate offshore and telephone betting for all involved, which would provide a new source of funding for the industry.  When is the legislation expected?  This is a serious issue for the country and, as the Taoiseach will be aware, it is an important part of Ireland&rsquo;s identity.  We are losing ground rapidly and it would not do to have the industry diminished by virtue of not taking action in time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the question on mental health facilities, I ask the Deputy to table a question to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moloney, who can update him regarding those matters.  I do not have that information available to me.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The legislative amendment we talked about bringing forward this morning at our meeting related to making sure there is a legal basis, unambiguously provided, that will allow for the exchange of information between the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.  This is an issue that involves the Chid Care Act, the Data Protection Act and constitutional provisions where a court order is in place based on <i>in camera</i> proceedings.  These issues have to be resolved legally and they can, and will, be resolved legally.  The purpose of the legislation is to allow for the exchange of information to take place that would satisfy the people on the review group to set about doing their work and getting whatever information they require in that respect.  Factual information requested by the group will be furnished as a matter for urgency by the HSE no later than Friday of this week to enable them to get on with this work.  In the meantime, the statutory provision should be brought forward as well to deal with the matter fully.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question on betting legislation, I took the opportunity of a recent speech to the horseracing industry to state that we have sought and found a way legally in which we can deal with the question of people applying for licences with which to have bets placed outside the jurisdiction and the legislation will be prepared during the course of this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a report in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> to the effect that the Moriarty tribunal is to make an interim report to the D&aacute;il.  Does the Taoiseach know anything about that and has the Government been informed that such a report is to be made to the D&aacute;il? </P>
        <P>In the course of an interview over the weekend the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, indicated that the three outstanding by-elections, the election for the Dublin mayor and the children&rsquo;s referendum would be held this year, on the same day.  Considering what the Minister had to say appears to be somewhat at variance with what the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have been telling the House over a number of weeks, will the Taoiseach say whether Deputy Gormley is wrong in taking that view?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have said, the Government has neither discussed nor made any decision on that matter.  People are giving their views, when asked, but there is nothing additional to be said in this regard until the Government makes some decisions. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the other point raised by Deputy Gilmore, I understand the Moriarty tribunal may be in touch with the Oireachtas.  I am not aware of any interim report being prepared.  The tribunal chairman will probably outline to us what his plans are to progress matters, depending on what timeframe might be involved.  We shall see what emerges in that regard but I do not have any knowledge of an interim report coming forward. </P>

	<P>Against the further daily revelations about the crisis state of leadership and management as regards child protection in the State, the T&aacute;naiste on Thursday indicated in questioning from this Deputy and others that there would be no objection to the Minister of State with responsibility for children addressing the issues raised by the recommendations in the Ryan report.  Can the Taoiseach indicate whether that is to be facilitated this week?  We were given to understand that a debate could be arranged on the matter and the Minister or State was more than willing to attend the House.  Both the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State concerned confirmed this.  On the first anniversary of the Ryan report, can the Taoiseach indicate to the House that we shall have such a facilitation to properly deal with statements &mdash; and questions to follow &mdash; on the recommendations of the Ryan report and all the other reports pertaining to children and child care provision by the State over the years? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation plan was actually initiated in July last year.  That anniversary takes place in July, but the Minister of State is available to discuss the matter in the House, with the agreement of the Whips.  It cannot be dealt with this week, but I am sure during the course of next month some type of arrangement can be made for that to happen. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>For the record of the House, I asked a question and there was a very clear answer to the effect that the Minister of State would give an update on the implementation plan as the T&aacute;naiste was not in a position to do that, with notice of a question. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>He will do that, but it cannot be facilitated this week. </P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two questions.  Today is International Missing Children&rsquo;s Day, and the European Commission has issued something of a criticism of Ireland, to the effect that the Minister has not activated the missing children&rsquo;s hotline, as have many other European countries.  It is three years since the original decision was made and considering our record is so poor as regards missing children&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach say when that is going to happen? </P>
        <P>My second question relates to legislation which deals with the imposition of windfall tax on electricity suppliers.  This matter was originally tacked on to a totally different Bill, namely, the Energy Biofuels Bill, and I want to compliment our Whip on ensuring that as it is a financial Bill it will be taken separately.  Will the Taoiseach say when we can expect this Bill and what will it be called?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="48"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can expect the Bill very soon, possibly next week or the week after. </P>
        <P>As regards the prior matter, the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews is in discussion with the NGOs to try to see how we might be able to provide a service in that respect.  The discussions are ongoing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask the Taoiseach about two matters.  As regards the &euro;750 billion stabilisation fund for the eurozone countries, could the Taoiseach say whether the Attorney General was able to advise if that would require legislation and in the event, when it will be brought before the House? </P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will recall that after Christmas the Labour Party had a Private Members&rsquo; motion to have a full proper inquiry into the banking crisis.  The Government tabled its own motion to have two private scoping inquiries, one to be conducted by the Governor of the Central Bank and the other by Herr Klaus Regling and Mr. Max Watson.  We were told that both of those reports would be presented to the Minister and the Government next Monday and Tuesday.  The Government undertook at the time to publish those reports immediately and bring them before the House or the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government will proceed to fulfil its promises in this regard?  In the event, the Government, I understand, has then to give details of an in-depth inquiry to be conducted with speed into the collapse of the banks in Ireland, possibly giving details, also, as regards the lead up to the blanket guarantee of all the debts of the covered institutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Attorney General is examining the issue of whether legislation is required.  I do not have information on his final deliberations in that regard, but I can check this.  Unfortunately, he is away for a couple of days. </P>
        <P>On the other matter, this will be dealt with by the authors of the report themselves.  I understand they are making progress with that report, but I am not aware when we will have it.  I suspect, as the Deputy says, that it will be the end of this month.  As soon as it is provided and considered by Government it will be published and will be debated in the House.  We shall take it from there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>On the inquiry that has been announced into the involvement of the State in the short life of Daniel McAnaspie, I have a number of questions.  Will the Taoiseach agree to lay the terms of reference of that inquiry before the House, for the information of Members?  Can he assure us that there will not be any confidentiality issues that might delay the inquiry, similar to other issues that we were talking about earlier?  Can the Taoiseach assure the House that the role of the Department of Education and Skills and indeed, the Children&rsquo;s Court, in respect of the neglect of Daniel McAnaspie, will also be investigated?  Finally, when does he expect to receive a report from that inquiry? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The terms of reference of the report will be determined by the HIQA guidelines for such investigations under the new arrangements that were introduced in January.  I can only refer the Deputy to those.  Obviously, I cannot anticipate the length of time it will take people to conduct the report, in line with those guidance criteria.  I am not aware of any confidentiality issues that might arise in that respect.  The new procedures under which the late Mr. McAnaspie&rsquo;s case will be dealt with, are set out in the HIQA guidance arrangements. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of the role of the Department of Education and Skills and the Children&rsquo;s Court, will the group&rsquo;s inquiry focus on those issues also?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="49"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an independent group, comprising three persons, presumably from a panel of 15.   It will determine, based on the HIQA guidance criteria, in what way the child care provisions of the legislation and so on were dealt with in this case and whether it was done properly.  I can only refer the Deputy to the HIQA guidelines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot pursue this on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not just the HSE that was negligent; it was also the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, we cannot pursue this matter on the Order of Business.  We had a reasonable response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Taoiseach provide an assurance that the terms of reference will not preclude an examination of the role played by those agencies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot anticipate the findings of the report.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give the Deputy any such assurance.  I can only give her the assurance that the procedure that has been established for all of these cases will be applied in this case.  I refer the Deputy to the HIQA guidelines in that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important and emotive issue.  Could the Taoiseach bring to the House as a matter of urgency the health information Bill, which has been mentioned many times before?  There has been a serious dearth of information in the House for a long time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We will make inquiries for the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand it will come to the House later this year.  I must point out to the Deputy that there are two separate issues here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a need to provide legal certainty for the sharing of information so that the review group can undertake the process it has been asked to undertake by the Minister.  The second issue is with regard to the validation of numbers.  Many numbers are being mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Bandied about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE is currently undertaking a process of collating files from the 32 community care areas across the country so it can provide an accurate figure for the number of deaths of children in care and of children who were known to social services over the last decade but were not in the care of the State, in line with the new HIQA guidelines which were published in March of this year.  That is an additional element which will require an intensive search of files across the country, a process which is now under way.</P>
        <P>It is not simply a matter of why there is no figure available for the number of children who have died in the care of the State.  We must also check those who were brought to the attention <Col N="51"/>of social services but were not in care and those who went beyond the age of 18 and thus were no longer children but required after-care services up to the age of 21.  Since the category of people being inquired about has been extended, all these files must now be checked.  It is not restricted to those who were in State care.  This is why there must be an extensive trawl through files.  This must be done properly so the correct information can be obtained.  There are 32 community care areas in which that exercise must take place, back-dated over the last ten years.  We must understand the work involved.</P>
        <P>Of course it would be far better if that information were immediately available.  I am simply explaining the circumstances; more time will be required to obtain the information.  The category of people involved has been extended to include not only those who were in State care but those who came to the attention of social services but were not in care and those who required after-care services after reaching the age of majority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I listened carefully to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer to Deputy Kenny on the legislation the Government believes is needed to underpin this transfer of information, but he did not give any indication of the timeframe involved.  I would appreciate if he could tell us when he expects the Bill to be published and dealt with in the House.</P>
        <P>The Limerick north side and south side revised regeneration plans were to go to Cabinet.  Have they been agreed by Government and, if so, are there any implications for the legislation?  Secondary legislation may be required because the bodies involved were set up by statute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe they have come before the Government yet, although they are imminent.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>My question relates to the 1975 European Union directive on waste.  As the Taoiseach knows, EU directives must be transposed into legislation three years after they have been agreed.  However, this directive has not yet been transposed into domestic legislation after 35 years.  Last year, the Commission took the Government to the European Court of Justice and won a decision against it.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>This is to do with legislation.  The result has been that the Government has had to pay its own legal fees plus three quarters of the EU&rsquo;s fees, with fines to come down the road.  In the meantime, rural house-building has continued apace without adequate septic tanks or treatment facilities.  We now have tens of thousands of housing units throughout the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We will make inquiries about the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which are in breach of the required rules.  When will that legislation be introduced?  When will we get it right?  How has it taken all this time for successive Ministers for the environment to introduce this legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to get back to the Deputy with that information.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="52"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the fact that it is not that usual for Ireland to be before the European Court of Justice, does the Taoiseach know anything about this legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste told me on Thursday in the context of the speech by the Director of Public Prosecutions that it was not the intention of the Government to introduce legislation to protect whistleblowers.  On Friday night the Minister for Justice and Law Reform made a speech to the Law Society which the media interpreted as meaning that there would be such legislation.  I accept that neither Deputy Ahern nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, tells the Taoiseach everything he is up to; I will have a private word with the Taoiseach about that some time.  Does he intend to introduce legislation to protect whistleblowers, or was this another kite flown by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been confirmed in the House on a number of occasions that a sectoral approach would be taken to whistleblower legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the same.  It is not general legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Are we sticking with the sectoral approach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the situation as has been outlined to date.  The Director of Public Prosecutions made some comments on this matter in recent times.  I understand the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Ahern, spoke to the Law Society recently about measures to be taken with regard to white-collar crime, which did not relate specifically to whistleblower legislation.  I am not aware that there has been a change in terms of moving to an omnibus Bill, but I will check for the Deputy.</P>

	<P>In the <i>Irish Examiner</i> this morning, there were large headlines to the effect that the water safety authority knew that 46 children had been drowned in Ireland last year.  The Road Safety Authority can tell us, county by county and road by road, how many people have died in road traffic accidents in a given year.  Does the Taoiseach agree that it defies belief that the people charged with responsibility for children do not know how many have died while under their care?</P>

	<P>We are hopeful that Bill will be published this session.  On the other issue, the Deputy was in the House for the previous debate on these matters where it was made clear that there are legal issues involved that we must resolve.  We cannot give a direction contrary to the law but must instead bring in new legislation to deal with the situation, which is what we are doing.  I have also explained to Members who have inquired in the House today that the remit of the investigation is extending beyond children who died in State care to include those who may have been notified to child protection services but were not in State care and who subsequently died.  All of that must be checked.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are currently 5,500 thousand children involved with the State services in terms of foster care, institutional care or special care.  That adds up to a substantial number in a ten-year period as per the extended remit.  While I would like to have that information for the House today, it is in the process of being obtained.  We have indicated that we will legislate in this area to ensure there is sufficient interaction between the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive so that the necessary information is available to Mr. Shannon and Ms Gibbons.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">The Minister will be familiar with these amendments which were debated on Committee Stage and a vote called on amendment No. 8 which, predictably, the Opposition lost.  As such, I do not intend to delay proceedings unduly.  My point is that when the Minister is determining whether we should amend the percentage of bio-fuel we mandate to be blended with carbon-based fuels like petrol and diesel, one of the issues he or she should factor in is the capacity of domestic producers to supply bio-fuels to meet that market demand.  I hope the Minister has had an opportunity to consider the points I made on Committee Stage and that he may have changed his mind, although I suspect not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2009 renewable energy directive set a 10% target for renewable energy in transport for all member states by 2020.  This is a binding target and we must, therefore, be extremely careful about how we condition decisions to that end when undertaking a <Col N="56"/>review of the rate of the bio-fuel obligation.  The custom tariff policies referred to are for products being brought into the State from outside the European Union.  Tariff policies are specific to individual member states and it would not be appropriate for me to consider policies in place in other member states when undertaking any review of the obligation rate.  As I stated previously, the approach taken by Ireland to deliver on the target will ensure there is sustainable development of an Irish bio-fuels market in line with overall bio-fuel policy criteria and the relevant European Union directives.  We are keen to see that happen but it is better achieved without being specific, as the Deputy proposes, but rather by maintaining the provisions as set out in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>On amendment No. 9, I am surprised that the Minister does not consider it appropriate for him or a future Minister to have regard to what other countries are doing in regard to tariff rates.  Certain European Union countries are effectively creating an artificial market for bio-fuels by applying higher import tariffs than others.  Germany, Spain and Portugal, for example, are applying a higher import tariff than, say, Britain on ethanol coming from Brazil.  It makes sense that we would consider what is happening in other member states before making a decision on the percentage of bio-fuel coming from domestic production and what can be done to promote it.  However, I accept the other points the Minister made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill provides that the Minister &ldquo;may also have regard to such other matters as he or she considers appropriate relating to the effects, in any, of increased consumption of biofuel in the State on economic activities in the State and on the environment&rdquo;.  In other words, there is already provision for us to consider broader issues and those issues will be taken into account by any Minister in such a review.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">This amendment was grouped with amendment No. 4 and others but it was not taken with them.  I will not make a big deal about this one.  The purpose of this amendment is to try to get security of supply issues into the transport fuel debate.  We spend a great deal of time here discussing security of supply and the Minister&rsquo;s Department spends a great deal of time trying to resolve issues around gas storage, oil storage and interconnection for security of supply and often we miss the point when it comes to security of supply for transport fuel because we import all of that too.  In fact, we import more of that than in the case of electricity generation because we import practically everything for transport fuels, apart from the small amount of <Col N="57"/>biofuel produced here.  I thought it appropriate to put the security of supply issue into this legislation in page 30 under the bio-fuels standards.  I hope the Minister will consider that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No.  Obviously, I consider that everything we are doing in this Bill is driven by a concern regarding future security of supply, particularly in the transport area.  I see the impetus behind this amendment but in a section on bio-fuel standards I do not believe that strategic intent would sit with the remaining part of the section and therefore I do not intend to include it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Before we finalise the debate on the Bill, I welcome the fact that the Minister has decided not to introduce a very large amendment on a carbon levy on energy generators to address an issue I have been raising for some time with the Minister and which, to be fair, has been with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office for some time.  The Minister might give us an indication as to when we are likely to see that legislation in a separate Bill rather than as an amendment to this legislation, which is a separate issue.  I understand the Department has been working overtime to try to make that happen.  I appreciate that because we want to try to get it in place before the summer recess.  My party will try to facilitate that as best we can.  We may have some differences of opinion in terms of the detail of the legislation but the principle is one we support.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a result of the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and in conjunction with what the Minister announced yesterday regarding refit tariffs for the biomass and bio-fuels industry in terms of energy generation, I hope we will soon see new tariffs coming into play for microgeneration and micro-CHP also.  An exciting new industry is developing here which this Bill supports by guaranteeing a marketplace for bio-fuels in Ireland.  The challenge for us as policymakers is to ensure we maximise the benefit of that bio-fuel for domestic industry and domestic producers, and I believe we are going some way to doing that.  I welcome the legislation and the debate we have had on it to date.  I look forward to seeing the new legislation on the carbon levy that was to be attached to this legislation but now will be a Bill in its own right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Deputy Coveney in commending the officials on the work that has been done on this Bill, which is an extensive piece of legislation.  We are a small Department but I believe we are a talented Department and take on important economic, security and environmental issues.  This is an example of the work we do that is of a very high standard, and I want to commend the officials in particular on the work they have done in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important legislation and part of a series of measures towards a changed energy future for this country, one that is more dependent on our own natural resources and therefore more secure in terms of pricing and threats to the planet from emissions.  In this Bill we are establishing the opportunity for Irish farming to have a new market to sell into, which is a crucial element in what we are doing.  It has not been an easy market to get into.  In any country there are sensitive issues around land use effects and food price effects of the development of biofuels.  We must continue to be very alert to what is happening in that market but I believe the provisions set out in this legislation, which backs up what is happening in Europe, allow us do that in a sustainable way.  I thank Members on all sides of the House for their assistance, in the Seanad as well as in the D&aacute;il, in getting this Bill through the Houses.</P><Col N="58"/>
        <P>On the other issue Deputy Coveney mentioned, namely, the introduction of a carbon levy, I was happy that the approach we were taking was appropriate.  My officials had done a great deal of work clearing it and ensuring it was the right way to proceed but when the Whip told me last week that he would prefer if it were done in a separate Bill, I was happy to accept his viewpoint.  I went to Cabinet this morning with a Bill set out in that manner containing the provisions we had intended to include in a Committee Stage amendment.  That Bill is ready to go for publishing.  I believe it takes a day or two to print and publish the Bill but that will be done immediately and I hope to get it into the D&aacute;il as soon as possible, possibly next week.  I appreciate Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s comments that he would be willing to facilitate the passage of the Bill, subject to amendments Deputies opposite may want to propose.  I hope we will be able to get it passed by the Houses before the end of this term and therefore be able to implement our policy objective.</P>
        <P>I am glad we have taken a major step in the right direction with our Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and I thank the House for the help in that regard.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am pleased to bring the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill 2010 to this House.  The aim of the Bill is to replace the old begging regime which criminalised all begging at all times with a more humane and progressive approach where begging only will be an offence where accompanied by disruptive behaviour such as harassment or intimidation.</P><Col N="59"/>
        <P>In particular, the Bill takes full account of the judgment delivered in December 2007 by the High Court in Dillon <i>v</i>. DPP.  Before we consider the Bill, it would be helpful to outline the main elements of that judgment.  It resulted from an action by a person charged with begging who sought a declaration that the law under which he was charged, namely, section 3 of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847, was unconstitutional.  The court found that section 3 was, in fact, unconstitutional on two counts.  For the record, section 3 states that &ldquo;every person wandering abroad and begging, or placing himself in any public place, street, highway, court or passage to beg or gather alms&rdquo; is guilty of the offence of begging.</P>
        <P>The court held that this specification of the offence was too vague and arbitrary and therefore in violation of Article 34.1, Article 40.1, Article 40.3 and Article 40.4.1&deg; of the Constitution.  Article 34 concerns the operation of the courts while Article 40 concerns personal rights.</P>
        <P>Having just heard me quote the text of section 3, I am sure Deputies might understand why it was struck down.  As can be seen, it is vague and generalised in the manner in which it defined the offence.</P>
        <P>The court also held that the constitutional right to free expression and communication as provided for in Article 40.3 and Article 40.6.1&deg; was being curtailed unreasonably by section 3.  This merely confirms that, subject to the law, citizens are entitled to communicate with fellow citizens in the normal course of daily life.</P>
        <P>The judgment went on to make very significant points that have been of great assistance in framing our response to the situation that we find ourselves in as a result of the decision.  I can do no better than to quote directly from the judgment.  The court stated that &ldquo;an overall ban on all forms of begging is unconstitutional&rdquo;, but added that &ldquo;Nothing in this judgment should be construed as preventing the legislature making laws controlling the location, time date, duration and manner in which begging or the seeking of alms might take place and the age of any person involved in such activity&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is important I emphasise that in the case, which was not appealed to the Supreme Court because it was so clear and the legal advice from the Attorney General was that we would not win, the court stated that &ldquo;an overall ban on all forms of begging is unconstitutional&rdquo;.  Obviously, we had to follow that in the framing of this legislation.</P>
        <P>On the possibility that legislation may set limits on the right to communicate, the judgment stated that &ldquo;it is undoubtedly so, that the right to communicate and the right to freedom of expression can be limited in the interests of the common good&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>A number of clear conclusions can be drawn from these remarks.  First, begging can be controlled.  Second, however, the law must be certain in its definition of the offending activity and it must be proportionate in any restrictions it places on what are, in other circumstances, constitutional rights.  Third, begging, of itself, is not necessarily an offence &mdash; it becomes an offence only when accompanied by certain disruptive behaviour, for example, harassment or intimidation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the judgment not only for the opportunity it gives us to update and express in modern terms the law as it applies to begging, but for the detail and guidance it contains.  It gives an opportunity to move away from laws that have their origin in a dark and tragic period in our past &mdash; I refer, of course, to the Great Famine.</P>
        <P>The Bill takes a radically different view of begging from the 1847 Act and pursues a more reasonable and rational approach.  I want to make a few further points before addressing the Bill in detail.  First, I emphasise that the legislation treats begging as a public order issue; that much is already clear from the Title.  The year 1847 was a time of enormous social upheaval <Col N="60"/>and the Act may have had social control as part of its purpose, but circumstances have changed since then.</P>
        <P>It is essential to note that this Bill does not present any threat or risk for the most needy and most vulnerable in society &mdash; all the social and other supports provided by State and voluntary agencies funded by the State will continue to be available.  I also emphasise that the Bill has no impact on the conduct of, for example, public charity collections.  These are already regulated by the Street and House to House Collections Act 1962 and by the Charities Act 2009.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains five sections, the most important being sections 2 and 3.  Section 1 contains the definitions of terms used in the Bill.  In so far as possible, the definitions are aligned with the definitions in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  In that respect, I draw attention to, for example, the definitions of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; and &ldquo;place&rdquo; &mdash; they have the same meaning in this Bill as they have in the 1994 Act.  For example, &ldquo;public place&rdquo; is given a wide definition and includes a highway, a churchyard or cemetery, a premises to which the public has access or a train or vessel.  A &ldquo;private place&rdquo; is any place that is not a public place.  This approach integrates the law on begging into the general body of public order law.  It also promotes consistency, certainty and clarity in the understanding and application of the law on public or private places.</P>
        <P>On the term &ldquo;begging&rdquo;, the Bill draws a distinction between the activity that constitutes begging and the circumstances where the offence of begging is committed.  The activity is defined in section 1.  Begging can arise in a public or private place.  It entails seeking money or goods from others &ldquo;without lawful authority&rdquo;.  In other words, the activity entails requesting money when in a public place and not having a licence or permit under any of the relevant statutes or by-laws and where nothing, either goods or services, is offered in return for the donation.  When conducted in a private place, begging is defined as being done without the consent of the owner or occupier.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 2 provides for the offence of begging.  It has general application &mdash; by that I mean it applies to persons of all ages and may occur in any place, either public or private.  Bearing in mind that the court stated already, in Dillon <i>v</i>. DPP, that &ldquo;an overall ban on all forms of begging is unconstitutional&rsquo;, but noting also that it stated that this did not prevent the introduction of legislation that controlled the manner and circumstances in which begging can take place, the offence in section 2 is committed when begging is accompanied by harassment, intimidation, assault, threats to any person or the obstruction of passage by persons or vehicles.  It is a summary offence with a maximum fine of &euro;400 or a custodial sentence of up to one month, or both.  I think an example will demonstrate the point I have been making.  Anyone who asks another person at a bus stop late at night to help with the fare is, perhaps, engaged in the activity of begging but it is not an offence if done in an agreeable manner.  It becomes an offence if the person threatens, assaults or intimidates his or her fellow passengers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 3 is, to my mind, very significant.  Deputies will recall from one of the extracts I quoted from the judgment that the Legislature may include appropriate restrictions in any laws on begging, and that the restrictions could relate to, for example, location, time and manner in which begging is carried on.  Section 3 avails of the possibilities presented by the judgment in this respect.  It bestows on members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a power to give directions to persons who are begging in particular locations or circumstances.  Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be able to direct a person who is begging to desist from acting in that manner and to leave the vicinity of that place in a peaceful manner.  Before dealing with each of the circumstances and <Col N="61"/>locations where this power may be exercised, I will note that subsection (6) requires the garda to use clear language when explaining the effect of a direction to any person.</P>
        <P>Subsection (1) provides that the member may give a direction when he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that the person who is begging is acting in a manner that constitutes an offence under section 2 or gives rise to a reasonable apprehension for the safety of persons or property or for the maintenance of the public peace.  As Deputies will recall, this can include begging on roadways or at busy junctions.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Subsection (2) provides that a Garda may exercise the new power where the person is begging within 10 m of the entrance to a dwelling, an automated teller machine or a vending machine.  These locations are chosen because they are ones where people are often distracted by the activity immediately at hand and often feel vulnerable in the presence of strangers.  They may be fearful of having keys snatched as they enter or leave their home.  In the case of ATMs, we know they are now an essential feature of our lives; many of us use them to transact much of our financial affairs.  Having another unknown person in close proximity while operating an ATM can give rise to anxiety and apprehension.  I had the reference to &ldquo;vending machine&rdquo; added so as to include machines in multi-storey car parks, for example.  These are locations where people should be able to conduct their business with a sense of security and I believe this section of the Bill provides that security.</P>
        <P>Subsection (3) provides that directions may be given where the person is begging within 10 m of the entrance to a business premises at any time when that premises is open to the public for business and the member has reasonable grounds for believing that the behaviour or number of persons begging is deterring the public from entering that premises.  This subsection will prove very useful for traders whose businesses are blighted by the presence of persons who are begging.  However, in line with the judgment, a person who is begging near a business premises but in a manner that is not interfering with customers, may not be subject to such a direction.  The conditions in this subsection or in subsection (1) must be met before a direction may be issued.  In other words, the begging must be causing obstruction or intimidating potential customers; it must be causing or likely to cause people to stay away.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Subsections (4) and (8) apply to a person who is begging in a private place or a private dwelling.  Either a garda, under subsection (4), or the owner or occupier, under subsection (8), may direct the person to desist and leave the premises.  Having regard to the special status under the Constitution of a private dwelling, subsection (7) provides that the garda may exercise the powers to give directions in a dwelling house when he or she is there with the consent of the owner or occupier.</P>
        <P>A person who contravenes a direction from a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is guilty of an offence and is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of up to &euro;300.</P>
        <P>Before I leave section 3, I want to give a clear message about the enforcement powers under this Bill, especially those in section 3.  It is my clear intention that the nuisance created by begging should not as a rule result in prosecutions and I am particularly keen to ensure imprisonment is not seen to be a solution.  Section 3 enables the difficulty in any particular case to be resolved quickly and effectively without recourse to prosecutions.  All that is required is goodwill and co-operation from those who are begging.</P>
        <P>The powers in section 3 will save Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and court time and will save costs generally.  Each prosecution ties up a lot of personnel and resources that could be better used in other areas.  Section 3 provides a means of avoiding many of those costs while also ensuring respect for the law.  As regards reliance on imprisonment, I know it has to be available as a last resort but I am ensuring we have a means available to avoid prosecutions and as a result reduce the <Col N="62"/>possibility of sending people to prison for offences such as begging.  The D&aacute;il has recently passed the Fines Bill which will be signed by the President in the coming days and this will also have an added effect in that respect.  On the overall scale of things, begging is a minor offence and prisons should not be used in such cases, except as a last resort.</P>
        <P>Section 4 establishes the powers of arrest under this legislation.  The section provides that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may arrest without warrant any person who is reasonably suspected of having committed an offence under sections 2 or 3.  A garda may require a person arrested under this section to give his or her name and address.  Any person who fails to comply with this request or who gives false or misleading information is guilty of an offence and is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;200 upon summary conviction.  Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may carry out their functions under this section when in a dwelling only if they are in the dwelling with the consent of the owner or occupier.</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of the House to subsection (5) which provides that a person&rsquo;s address may be a place which he regularly visits.  This has been added to facilitate persons who are without a permanent address and it ensures they can comply with the request for details of their address from the arresting garda.  Section 5 is a standard provision on the Short Title of the Bill and the collective citation of the Public Order Acts.  The citation underlines my earlier remarks on how this Bill is linked in to the Public Order Acts.</P>
        <P>I wish to inform the House that I am examining whether additional legislative provision is required to deal with what might be termed as &ldquo;organised begging rings&rdquo;.  If additional measures are required, it is likely I will bring them forward on Committee Stage.  On a related point, I wish to make clear that the Bill does not alter in any way section 247 of the Children Act 2001.  That section makes it an offence to procure or to control a child for the purposes of begging.  A number of Deputies have made the point over the years that organised begging rings are in operation in major urban areas.  I am open to amendments in that respect and I will be examining such provisions.</P>
        <P>This is a short Bill but it is a comprehensive response to the High Court judgment.  It enables the law on begging to be updated in a manner that is not only consistent with the Constitution, but also ensures maximum effectiveness in enforcement with reduced emphasis on prosecutions and penalties.  It targets those whose begging presents an unacceptable interference with the normal conduct of life in society.  Unlike the 1847 Act, which it is replacing, this Bill implies no judgment on the persons who are begging.  Its only concern is the maintenance of public order where that order is being challenged by persons who are begging.  In other words, the focus is on dealing with the activity that represents an unacceptable interference with public order.  I am pleased to commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have no doubt the irony of this legislation at this specific time has crossed many people&rsquo;s minds, including the Minister and those officials who have drafted this Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill 2010.  I know that the Minister will not want to hear this &mdash; I do not say it facetiously &mdash; but the people of Ireland have surely been the victims of the greatest act of begging, or indeed even mugging, over the past two years.  With NAMA and bank recapitalisation, the Department of Finance on Upper Merrion Street could be regarded as the greatest ATM machine in the country.  At this stage, it would be nice to see the potential powers enabled by this legislation applied retrospectively.  It would be just reward for the people of Ireland if the new powers included in this Bill enabling the garda&iacute; to direct persons begging within 10 m of an ATM to desist and to move on from the vicinity, could be handed down to those who arrived in Merrion Square, with their hands out in September 2008 who indeed have exhibited persistent tendencies ever since.</P><Col N="63"/>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister on the initiative he showed last weekend at the Law Society of Ireland dinner with regard to his proposed Corruption Bill dealing with white collar crime.  The Minister has made amendments to the Bill since publication of the general scheme in November 2008 and the Bill is the better for it.  However, he still has some adjustments to make.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this Bill is the provision of a legal mechanism to control and deter begging.  It is regrettable, in my view, that we are debating this issue; it is regrettable that we as legislators are enacting laws to prevent the act of begging on our streets, at a time when many families are living in poverty.  Begging is inextricably linked to poverty, homelessness and access to social services.  The real issue here is that the Government needs to address the reasons we have a begging issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Until the High Court decision in Dillon <i>v</i>. DPP in December 2007, the law on begging in this country had been governed by the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847.  This law was introduced in Ireland during a period right after the Great Famine.  The purpose of the Act was to regulate the social effects of the Famine disaster.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1985, the Law Reform Commission published a report on vagrancy and related offences, in which it recommended that the Vagrancy Act be amended, consolidated, or replaced, but not entirely abolished.  At that time, the Law Reform Commission suggested that a general offence of begging should be retained.  Then came the Dillon judgment, where Mr. Niall Dillon had challenged the provisions of section 3 claiming that they were inconsistent with the Constitution in that they interfered with his constitutional right to freedom of expression and to communicate, contrary to Article 40.6.1&deg;, and were disproportionate and interfered with his constitutional rights to a greater extent than that necessary, having regard to the offence and the circumstances of the applicant.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice de Valera struck down the 1847 provision for being too broad and not attempting to balance the rights of society against those of the beggar.  While he struck down section 3 of the 1847 Act as unconstitutional, the judge clearly held that there was no necessary constitutional problem with anti-begging legislation.  So here we are at this legal juncture, having to provide for the practice of begging on our streets.</P>
        <P>The distinction between begging and public nuisance is important in this legislation.  In 2007, a Eurobarometer survey indicated that Irish people are relatively tolerant of the practice of begging on the streets.  They are able to make the distinction that most people do not choose to beg, and that there are many underlying causes for begging in the first place.</P>
        <P>According to the survey of 27 EU member states, on average, 36% of people give money to charitable organisations, while 74% of Irish people do so.  Across the EU, 29% give money to people on the streets, while in Ireland we were again above the average with 32% of people doing so.  Most interestingly, the EU average of those giving no help whatsoever is 18%, while the figure for Ireland is practically nil, at 2%.  These figures indicate that Irish people are significantly more charitable in nature than our EU partners concerning street begging.</P>
        <P>I would not like to see this legislation being imposed in a draconian manner.  It must not be used as sledgehammer legislation to crack a problem which is a relatively small nut.  Just across the road from my constituency office in Francis Street, Ennis, an elderly woman sits outside a parochial centre.  She has been there for years, since before my time as a politician.  I have never seen that woman intimidating or harassing anybody.  At this stage, I would say that her presence seems acceptable to everyone.  The terms of this legislation, however, would indicate that she could be fined or imprisoned for her actions.  Given the data established on Irish attitudes to begging, I do not think anyone wants to see this legislation applied to cases such as the one I have just cited.  That is why the distinction between begging and public nuisance <Col N="64"/>must be made clearer.  The definitions of &ldquo;harass&rdquo; and &ldquo;intimidate&rdquo; as used in the Bill, are subjective in nature and somewhat undermine the High Court&rsquo;s decision in the Dillon judgment, in which it was stated that &ldquo;...an overall ban on all forms of begging is unconstitutional&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Section 1 attempts to recognise the judgment of the High Court in the Dillon case.  It creates the balance or differentiation between what could be interpreted as a vindication of the rights, as recognised by the Constitution with regard to legal begging and begging accompanied by the aggravating factors of harassment, intimidation, assault, obstruction and threatening behaviour.  I must re-emphasise that on Committee Stage the Minister needs to deal with the subjective nature of section 2.</P>
        <P>Outside the subjectivity of section 2, the fact that this section does not refer in any way to the possibility of someone begging in a manner as described &mdash; whether by harassment, intimidation, assault, obstruction or threatening or, perhaps, by offering a token good or service in return for moneys offered &mdash; could render this section irrelevant, where the offence is thus defined.  The Minister should re-examine section 2 of the Bill from those perspectives.  I recognise that this needs a delicate approach, in that we do have a culture of quality street entertainment, including busking.  However, it is a loophole that should be addressed at this early stage of its implementation.</P>
        <P>The existing law on begging by children is covered by section 247(3) of the Children Act 2001.  It is proposed that in this legislation no age distinction be made, but I am uncomfortable with this.  The basic tenet in establishing our relatively new juvenile justice system was to create a distinction between children and adults.  Raising the criminal age of intent to 12 years was a repeal of legislation dating from Victorian times, similar to what this legislation seeks to do by repealing the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act of 1847.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fact that this legislation does not expressly make a distinction between an adult and a child is a regressive step.  Notwithstanding the fact that children who are tried and convicted of an offence under this Bill will, as in most other cases affecting children, be dealt with in accordance with the child-focused provisions of the Children Act 2001, this element of the legislation is weak and not proofed <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Children Act 2001.  Under section 247(1) of the Children Act 2001, a person is guilty of an offence if he or she procure a child, or allows a child in his or her care, to be in any street or public place for the purpose of begging.  Section 247(3) provides that a person found guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &euro;250, in the case of a first offence, or &euro;500 for a second or subsequent offence.</P>
        <P>Interestingly, under the Bill the offence of begging offers the liability on summary conviction of a fine not exceeding &euro;400 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month, or both.  One can conclude from this that the child convicted of begging can be fined up to &euro;400 and imprisoned for a month, while the parent or person directing the activity can be only fined up to &euro;250.  The Minister should amend the legislation to correct this anomaly.</P>
        <P>Under section 4 it will also be an offence to fail to give one&rsquo;s name and address, or to give false details on arrest for begging, with a separate fine of up to &euro;200 for committing this specific offence of failing to give one&rsquo;s details.  It is difficult to see how workable this particular section of the legislation will be.  By its nature, begging is carried out by homeless people who have fallen on hard times and are often living rough on the streets.  It will be difficult for some homeless people to comply with this requirement, in that an address at which they reside will not apply.  I cannot see any provision in the Bill as published to mitigate the fact that a homeless person has a reasonable excuse for not being able to give an address to the Garda.</P><Col N="65"/>
        <P>The Housing Act 1988 defines a homeless person as somebody who has no reasonable accommodation to live in or who lives in a hospital, institution or night shelter because of the lack of a home.  All of these categories can comply with the legislation.  However, it is the visible homeless &mdash; those living on the streets and sleeping rough who also beg &mdash; who will potentially come into conflict with this aspect of the legislation.</P>
        <P>In 2008, the Homeless Agency conducted a survey of homelessness in Dublin.  It counted 2,366 people who were homeless in the city, of whom 110 were sleeping rough.  Through his various media releases on this Bill, the Minister has been at pains to point out that he considers there are many appropriate services in place and that we should not have this level of begging on our streets.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>I accept the point the Minister is making.  It is essentially an academic, bureaucratic or end-of-year report type comment.  The fact remains that there are many who for various reasons cannot avail of the services that are on offer.  Despite the Minister&rsquo;s opinion, the State has shown itself to come up short on many occasions.</P>
        <P>One would not have to travel very far from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann any night to witness at first hand the rate of homelessness.  It is quite disturbing to see people of all ages, men and women, sleeping rough on cardboard boxes and sleeping bags in the doorways throughout Dublin city.  In my constituency office in recent months I have noticed an increase in the number of people requiring help with social welfare payments and entitlements.  In many cases, for whatever reason, the Department is using the habitual residency clause to delay payments.  Many of the people in question have no money and are under extreme pressure.  The emergency budgets administered by community welfare officers are stretched and people are just not getting their money.  That is happening more and more each week.  The particularly bureaucratic nature of our systems and the retrenchment of many of our social services will contribute in a negative way to begging on the streets in future.  Poverty related issues are likely to surface now that we are two years into the recession.  The effects of long-term unemployment, the relentless nature of personal debt and the breakdown of relationships will manifest themselves on our streets in the years to come.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is interesting to note that the vagrancy Act, which this legislation proposes to replace, was introduced in 1847, a number of years after the Famine began.  The statistics as presented in the Bills digest for this legislation make for interesting reading.  Those available are from 2003 to 2007.  The year 2007 itself can be disregarded in that the Dillon judgment came into effect during that year.  There is a consistency in the rate of conviction of approximately 35%, however, the number of proceedings varies, from a high of 729 in 2003 to a low of 395 in 2006, with 416 in 2004 and 663 in 2005.  That seems to indicate an issue that is not receiving a co-ordinated and systemic approach.  I do not think that is purely because of the lack of legislation.  The digest does not contain any specific statistics on the proceedings and convictions carried out as a result of section 247 of the Children Act 2001.  That, in itself, is a figure that would be of interest.</P>
        <P>Section 3 deals with the powers of the Garda to give direction.  Subsection 3(6) states: &ldquo;A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall, upon giving a direction under this section, inform the person to whom the direction is given, in clear language, that if he or she fails to comply with the direction he or she shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;  What about foreign nationals who beg?  In that case what would constitute clear language?  What if the individual in question does not understand English or Irish?</P><Col N="66"/>
        <P>There is a strong belief that legislation alone is not the universal answer to the complex social issues surrounding begging.  Begging is inextricably linked to poverty, homelessness and proper access to social services.  While the legislation is necessary because of the vacuum created by the Dillon judgment, the Government needs to continue to address the reasons people beg.  Those that are most vulnerable in society tend to be the first to suffer from cutbacks implemented on their behalf so that the economy might recover.  The incidence of begging associated with racketeering must be addressed with legislation such as this, but the fundamental causes that force the majority of people onto the streets to beg must be addressed.  It is worth noting that the individual who initiated the original appeal on conviction, Mr. Niall Dillon, was described as a &ldquo;college graduate who had fallen on hard times&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We in Fine Gael reluctantly support the Bill.  This legislation alone will not solve the problem of begging, which is closely associated with homelessness, extreme poverty and access to social services.  We should be spending more time dealing with these root causes, rather than criminalising people who are forced to beg having fallen on hard times.  I look forward to tabling amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>One would not get 30 minutes to deal with the banking crisis, yet we can devote that much time per speaker to dealing with beggars.  When the history of this time is written, people will see in the middle of the year 2010 that at the nadir of the worst recession that ever affected this country in living memory our preoccupation in this House is with a Bill to put beggars in prison.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am uneasy about the Bill.  I note that its purpose is to replace the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847.  I do not get much comfort from that either, in the sense that I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not know something the rest of us do not know and anticipates the return of famine conditions given that the Bill replaces one that was introduced at the height of the Famine.  In 1847 the unfortunate beggars were usually people forced onto the streets to beg because of famine conditions.  They could end up being incarcerated in the house of correction for a month.  The mindset has not changed much since then because the penalty outlined in the Bill in cases where the unfortunate beggar is unable to discharge the fine is a month in prison.  Not much has changed.  One has to look at the Bill in the context of the Bill we enacted last week, namely, one to diminish the number of times that someone unable to discharge a fine ends up in Mountjoy or in another prison.  In this case we are expressly providing that where a beggar is unable to discharge a fine that he &mdash; beggars are mostly men &mdash; can end up in Mountjoy for a month.  On the one hand we are sponsoring and advocating legislation the purpose of which is to limit the number of people who go to prison for failure to pay a fine and in this Bill we are expressly providing that the ultimate sanction is imprisonment for someone in breach, as envisaged in this legislation.  It seems to me a head-on contradiction between our purpose in one piece of legislation and in another.</P>
        <P>As the Minister indicated, the High Court struck down the Act in 2007 for the reasons he stated.  It appears that it is the conventional wisdom, and certainly the wisdom of his departmental servants, that the visibility and extent of begging on the streets has increased.</P>
        <P>Apparently, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is of the opinion that this phenomenon cannot be coped with within the existing legislation.  It seems to believe that the public order law, for example, is not capable of dealing with it.  Garda estimates of the extent of begging are questioned by those who work at the coal face.  It was claimed in 2007, at the time of the Dillon case, that begging was an increasing criminal justice problem.  The figures show that successful begging prosecutions fell dramatically in the years leading up to that action.  Some 729 proceedings were initiated in 2003, but that number was just 395 in 2006 and <Col N="67"/>just 64 in 2007.  There were 274 convictions in 2003, but just 14 in 2007.  The statistics do not appear to be consistent with the claims that are made about a worsening phenomenon.  A helpful table in the digest prepared by the library and research service sets out the proceedings initiated and convictions secured, etc., for the five years running up to 2007.  I would like to hear more about the Minister&rsquo;s expert advice in light of this apparent inconsistency.  It is claimed that the phenomenon we are debating is worsening, but the statistics tend to show that the opposite is the case.</P>
        <P>I do not seek to deny the anecdotal evidence that exists.  There are concerns about this issue for a variety of reasons, some of which are quite complex.  A number of people on the streets are begging for subsistence reasons.  Some of them beg because they are suffering from the effects of the misuse of drugs, or from mental health problems.  Others are immigrants who have fallen on hard times &mdash; members of the Roma community, for example.  I accept that a distinction must be drawn between the phenomenon of begging, as we know it in this country, and the forms of begging that involve intimidation, harassment or serious activity that is likely to constitute a danger to drivers, for example.  It should be possible to control this situation.</P>
        <P>I have serious doubts about the merits of a law that threatens the incarceration of an ordinary beggar who is unable to discharge a fine.  We passed the Fines Bill 2010, the underlying principle of which is to keep people who do not pay fines out of prison, last week.  I appreciate these questions can be answered on Committee Stage.  I wonder how deeply the Minister has probed this question.  What sanctions are appropriate when the Garda feels it has to proceed with a prosecution in respect of a breach of this legislation?  I am talking about the average person begging on the streets, rather than members of the criminal fraternity.  How realistic is it to ask people who are down on their luck &mdash; the homeless, drug abusers or those who have been ejected from their homes &mdash; to pay fines of &euro;200 or &euro;400 in the knowledge that if they are unable to do so, they will be sentenced to months in Mountjoy Prison?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the maximum punishment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of these people are in such circumstances that they might welcome a month in the prison.</P>
        <P>I apologise to the Minister for missing his opening remarks.  I was surprised by the speed with which the amendments to the previous Bill were dispatched.  The Minister seems to want to indicate that he does not intend imprisonment to be the normal consequence of the implementation of this Bill.  I agree with that intention.  I do not question the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides, if that is what he is saying.  Like me, he knows that what he intends is of little enough significance.  It is what is written in the law that matters.  That is how the court is going to consider it.  It will not matter that the Minister of the day did not intend it to be used in such a manner.  I am not sure what steps the Minister will take to ensure this legislation is implemented as he hopes.</P>

        <P>I would like to ask the Minister about the definition of the kind of people who may find themselves in breach of this new legislation.  Section 2(<i>b</i>) states that a person who, while begging in any place, &ldquo;obstructs the passage of persons or vehicles, is guilty of an offence and is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;400 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month or both&rdquo;.  I wonder whether it is possible to engage in begging without obstructing someone.  I was obstructed three times on Grafton Street today by representatives of worthy organisations who wanted me to sign up to support meritorious charities of one kind or another.  I do not know how it is possible to be stopped on the sidewalk, and to be asked to <Col N="68"/>contribute alms to somebody who is begging, without that technically constituting an obstruction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It does not matter whether one operates on the basis of the definition in section 2 of the Bill, or on the basis of the powers given to the Garda in terms of designated areas.  Both of them are arbitrary and capable of arbitrary implementation.  They are capable of being invoked at the caprice of the garda concerned.  I find it difficult to reconcile that with the Minister&rsquo;s hope that this will not lead to a number of additional people being incarcerated in Mountjoy.  I suspect the Minister is acutely aware of why that is desirable.  It is not for any great reason of compassion or humanity.  I am not denying that he has either of those impulses.  It is because of the acute and serious overcrowding in our prisons.  I refer to the sheer pressure on our prisons as they try to cope with the number of people sent to them from the courts.  We know from the most recent remarks of the retiring governor of Mountjoy Prison that the prison is horrifically overcrowded.  The retiring governor of the women&rsquo;s prison, D&oacute;chas, specifically instanced overcrowding as the cause of her early retirement.</P>
        <P>The last thing we need is for people on the streets, there for the complex reasons we have discussed, ending up being prosecuted and incarcerated.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s reconciliation of his aspirations in this regard with what is contained in the Bill.  The opportunity will come to tease this out further on Committee Stage.  The distinction between begging, causing a public nuisance or threatening someone can be difficult.</P>
        <P>I accept the recent practice of the immigrant community, particularly but not exclusively by members of the Roma-Gypsy community, of turning up at cars waiting at traffic lights to beg or clean windows can be a traffic hazard.  I accept the presence of some person, who can be intentionally intimidating or otherwise, in the immediate vicinity of an ATM can be a problem for some people and necessitates some control.  I accept the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carefully implements sensitive measures such as those contained in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Again, though, it will depend on circumstances like the wide variations seen when legislation on drinking in public places was introduced.  Occasionally in this country we get a warm weekend like we just had and, accordingly, many people like to drink a pint outside of the pub in the open air on the footpath.  One garda may simply note such an occasion and move on if there is no reason for him or her to do otherwise; another may be punctilious enough to cause the pathway to be cleared.  Equally with this legislation, a great deal of arbitrary power is being left with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with begging.</P>
        <P>In <i>Strumpet City</i> the character Rashers Tierney got around anti-begging laws by offering a trinket in return for a few bob.  Similarly, this Bill&rsquo;s provisions do not apply to cases where some trinket is offered.  I would have thought some of our more enterprising beggars will latch on to the Rashers Tierney clause fairly quickly.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on this?</P>
        <P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s response to the comments made by Barnardos on the child-adult issue to this legislation?  It has pointed out the Bill&rsquo;s provisions will apply to a person of any age, including a child, who may be arrested without warrant.  It claims the possibility of a child being detained under this legislation is in contravention of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The charity stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Legislation alone will not address the problem of begging which stems for the societal failure to care for and protect vulnerable people including children. Barnardos recommends adequate resources be available for homeless services and a full commitment given to implement The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008-<Col N="69"/>2013. It is unacceptable that the HSE introduced a funding freeze on services dealing with homelessness in July 2008. This resulted in people, including children, being turned away from emergency accommodation. Given the worsening economic climate and rising unemployment, the demand for such services is likely to increase and the removal of vital services will exacerbate the problems facing vulnerable people.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Children and young people who are forced to beg are very vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. The lack of a 24 hour nationwide social work service and the closure of two residential centres which catered for homeless boys and girls aged 12-18 places these children and young people in further danger.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This is a problem the Minister will have to address, as indeed are some of the comments in the observation paper from the Irish Human Rights Commission.  It noted begging is frequently a direct result of being homeless and, in such circumstances, failing to provide an address should not be penalised.  It recommended a defence of reasonable excuse be included in the Bill to cover such situations.  As we well know in this House, homelessness is a complex phenomenon.  Where there is no defence of reasonable excuse, the person is indeed vulnerable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a minor single-issue Bill of which I do not want to make a meal.  There is a necessity for a reasonable control of the phenomenon of begging.  However, certain white collar persons in positions of responsibility have brought our economy to the edge of ruin for which ordinary people are paying the price.  The latter demand some action be taken against those responsible for plunging our country into the depths of economic despair, yet, there is no evidence the former&rsquo;s lifestyles have altered in the slightest.  They still give us the two fingers in how they disport themselves.  None of them has had his or her collar felt by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or had any prosecutions taken against him or her.  They have done more damage to this society than the entire beggar community could ever do.  It seems the white collar individuals can do so with impunity.</P>
        <P>Most ordinary taxpayers are immensely resentful of the hardships imposed on them by the Government when no action will likely be taken against those who have brought us to the stage at which we are, yet, this House can find time to bring in specific legislation to control beggars.  If the only damage done to this country was that done by beggars, then we would be well able to afford to deal with it.  It is far more serious than that.  This House cannot find time to change the ineffectual legislation that means it will take forever to mount a prosecution against those white-collar persons, if ever there will be any, but it can to deal with begging.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party will not oppose the legislation in principle.  However, there are several matters which we must tease through with the Minister on Committee Stage. I would be pleased if, in his reply, the Minister would seek to address the belief in his Department that this is a worsening phenomenon, because statistics showed a fall-off in prosecutions before the Act was struck down by the High Court.  On Committee Stage we will seek to advance three or four important amendments but, other than that, we will not oppose the legislation in principle on Second Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelGrealishPD"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Grealish</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the Bill.  While welcoming the proposed legislation on begging, I am aware it is far from the mentality of any of us to come the heavy on people who may be, for whatever reason, on the streets begging for money.  Many in the House come from a modest background but our sympathy for our fellow human beings must not blind us to the different aspects of the situation with which we are now dealing.</P><Col N="70"/>
        <P>Despite the recession, which has hit us and much of the world, we are a country that makes a decent effort to help our less well-off people.  Those who beg on the streets must be directed to social services to get help and advice.  There is a good deal of help for such people if only they would go and use it.  Many of the people begging on our streets do not go near the social services.  Services and money are available for those in trouble.  It does people no long-term good to continue to beg on the streets.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, sometimes conmen and women are involved in this activity.  Last year, I visited San Francisco and I noticed the amount of people begging on the pier there, especially near restaurants and tourist areas.  Through friends of mine, I met some people who worked for the US Secret Service.  One night, I was out for dinner and I commented on the issue to these people.  They informed me that some beggars make a sizeable living from the activity and that the FBI had arrested an individual some weeks beforehand who was living in a house worth in excess of $500,000 and who drove a high-powered, expensive car and made this money from begging on the streets.  He was an individual with one leg and he used this to his advantage.  Such activities go on in certain places and we must have legislation to deal with the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The background to the legislation used to deal with begging up to 2007 is a sad reminder of tragic times in our country.  The Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847 was not our legislation.  It was an Act framed under British rule aimed at the poor and destitute suffering from the effects of the Great Famine.  Thankfully, terms such as &ldquo;vagabonds&rdquo; and &ldquo;ruffians&rdquo; in that 160 year old legislation are gone from our language.  Despite whatever arguments exist between people in the country, we have moved on from such terminology and we have it within our control in our Parliament to frame humane and fair legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The result of the High Court case of Dillon <i>v</i>. DPP in 2007 set certain boundaries for what the D&aacute;il and Seanad could attempt in this legislation.  It is not proposed to make asking for help in public places an offence.  It is clear that in practical terms this makes sense.  Many individuals and organisations look for money from us on the streets every day of the week for worthy causes.  Such requests constitute fund-raising and are authorised by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  One must acknowledge the tremendous work done by volunteers on the streets, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Cro&iacute; and, especially in Galway, the Galway Hospice, which provides a great service.  Much of its funding is received from people on the streets, especially on Saturdays by volunteers going around with a bucket outside matches.  Such fund-raising is controlled and organised and is for a very good cause.  Apart from fund-raising, other requests for money or help for individuals come under the umbrella of free speech and free association, which are kernels of our democracy.</P>
        <P>However, we must apply ourselves to the practical issues.  The public has a right to expect reasonable protection from undue pressure in their homes and public places.  Sometimes, I see people openly begging in places on Shop Street in Galway city and this can create an uneasy atmosphere for shoppers and tourists.  Galway city needs tourists and needs to provide them with a good experience and a ce&aacute;d m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  The money that comes in from tourism helps the community and the public purse in general.</P>
        <P>From the digest of the Bill, I note it is proposed to ensure certain places are off limits for those who beg, including begging door-to-door or in people&rsquo;s private property.  In recent years especially around Galway city, one has seen many people begging from door-to-door with young children.  They have been seen pushing prams, begging for clothes and this is a major nuisance to people in their homes.  I am pleased this will be addressed in the Bill.  It will become <Col N="71"/>illegal, as will begging within 10 m of dwellings, ATMs and vending machines.  I note that begging would be prohibited within 10 m of business premises as well if such activity is deterring people from going into such premises.</P>
        <P>I agree with these measures but I suggest other locations should be included as well.  The restrictions should apply to the surrounds of churches and places of worship, especially in the major towns and cities.  People coming out after masses and services often see people begging outside.  Begging should be prohibited in the vicinity of buses and train stations.  While walking to the D&aacute;il from where I stay, I pass one or two train stations.  One always sees at least ten to 15 people on both sides of a railway station or bus station targeting tourists in particular.  When tourists move from town to town, many use public transport, that is, our trains or bus services.  As soon as they come to our towns the first thing they see is people begging.  I trust this will be addressed in this Bill as well.</P>
        <P>A key aspect of the new legislation is clarity.  I understand clear regulations may be laid down, but I foresee difficulties in their implementation.  After all, there is little difference between 10 m and 11 m from an ATM.  Under the proposed legislation, there may be begging without breaking the law at an 11 m distance but not at a 10 m distance.</P>
        <P>Another area open to interpretation relates to what constitutes aggressive begging in public places.  I understand how this could be a matter of argument.  It would be a matter of the judgment of the garda&iacute; on the spot and, to be fair, one cannot legislate for all situations.  Everyone in the House agrees that begging has to be controlled, especially in our major towns and cities.  These people on our streets always target our tourists.  Often one will see a tourist walking through a major town or village and a lady with two young children can be seen walking after that tourist trying to intimidate and put pressure on him or her.  This is annoying for the tourists that come to our towns.  I compliment and congratulate the Minister on introducing these proposals.</P>

	<P>Like most other speakers and parties, Fine Gael does not oppose the Bill.  I will refer to several issues and speak a good deal more when I am afforded the opportunity on Committee Stage.  Many people gathering around the water coolers in the morning in various places of work will not be speaking about this Bill.  There are issues to be discussed.  I am pleased the Minister is doing his best to try to help the public, which, to this day, has great sympathy for people who have fallen on bad times.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>With the permission of the House, I will share my time with Deputies Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan, David Stanton and Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
         <P>The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that the citizens of the Republic of Ireland are fully represented in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Bill will prevent any Government from blocking the filling of vacant D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann seats as a tactic to protect its own narrow majority.  The people in every constituency in the Republic of Ireland have a right to full democratic representation in their <Col N="72"/>national parliament.  That is what Deputies are elected to do at general elections.  It is incumbent upon us, on all sides of the House, to look to the future rather than seek precedents in the past.  We must take this situation out of the realms of party political consideration and move to give the people in any constituency an opportunity to be fully represented within a defined period of time.  Fine Gael proposes that period should be six months.</P>
        <P>Preventing full democratic representation damages the reputation and integrity of Irish political institutions. This is a wrong that could be put right by the acceptance of this legislation.  The Bill will ensure the relevant writ will be moved by the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, on instruction from the Ceann Comhairle, in any by-election where the vacancy has existed for six months.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is a more important reason to have an electoral mandate in those constituencies.  The Government, which is made up of Fianna F&aacute;il, greens, Independents who were Progressive Democrats Members in their former glory and those who were elected as Independents, has no popular mandate from the people of Ireland.  This grouping of parties and Independents was never put to the Irish people.  It was cobbled together in the aftermath of the 2007 general election by a Taoiseach who is now recognised as having brought this country to its knees, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Those who caused the economic collapse of the country are not those who will get us out of it.  There is no mandate for the Taoiseach, who predicted that we would have a soft landing and that the temporary economic dip would be short-lived.  The response to the banking crisis, in particular, has the potential to cause lasting economic damage for generations.  The banking bailout scandal will end up costing the State &euro;73 billion and includes bailing out zombie banks such as Anglo Irish Bank.  These banks will most likely never recover and the taxpayer will never see its money again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our national debt is spiralling out of control, leaving a huge burden for future generations and leaving the country vulnerable to international speculators, but massive Government tax increases and cuts in investment in recent budgets are not the solution.  At more than 14% of GDP, Government borrowing will be the highest in Europe this year, partly because of the huge bailout for Anglo Irish Bank, and the national debt is likely to break through &euro;100 billion by the end of this year.  This is almost a four-fold increase since 2007 and does not even include the additional &euro;43 billion bailout by NAMA for the banking system.  Unless we fix the public finances, within a decade Ireland will end up spending twice as much on debt servicing as on education.</P>
        <P>By adopting policies that are destroying jobs, this Government is chasing its tail.  The 16% increase in taxes in 2009 made Ireland a less attractive place to work, to invest and to do business.  That is why tax receipts fell by &euro;10 billion and are expected to fall again this year.  The &euro;4 billion in cuts announced in December will be offset by higher debt servicing costs and welfare payments to the unemployed.</P>
        <P>We cannot go back to the well this year to look for more tax increases or cuts in the capital programme, social welfare rates and public sector pay.  This will not help the disposable income required to contribute to national recovery.  Before the last budget, Fine Gael put forward constructive suggestions for the creation of employment.  We are the first Opposition party to put forward &euro;4 billion of choices we would have made, unlike what Fianna F&aacute;il did when it was in Opposition during a time of national crisis in 1982-87. I am sure the Minister will acknowledge this.  Old style politics changed some time ago.  We recognise that but, unfortunately Fianna F&aacute;il did not do so when a similar situation arose in the 1980s and since.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Eighteen months into the credit crunch, the Government&rsquo;s policy of &ldquo;writing whatever cheques are necessary&rdquo; to bail out delinquent banks like Anglo Irish Bank is not fair, not prudent and not working.  It is making the recession here deeper and longer than in other <Col N="73"/>countries.  Because of the Government&rsquo;s mismanagement, the Irish crisis has been longer and more expensive than in almost any other country.  The bailouts announced to date will double the national debt and are equivalent to adding &euro;50,000 to every family&rsquo;s mortgage.  The credit crunch continues here, long after it has ended elsewhere.  The Minister knows that lending to small businesses decreased from &euro;33.6 billion in February 2009 to &euro;32.7 billion in September 2009, or by 2.6%, according to the Mazars report of December 2009. A recent UCC study estimated that 60% of small businesses have been refused credit by the banks.  This flies in the face of what the Minister for Finance has been continually telling us, that the reason for the bank bailout and for the National Asset Management Agency is to get credit flowing again and to make sure businesses got the necessary financial resources to keep people in employment and to create new opportunities.  That is not happening.  The repeated claims by Government that these taxpayer bail-outs are necessary to finance new lending to Irish businesses are false.  Seventy-five percent of the money the Government is proposing be used to recapitalise our banks is now going to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, dead banks that will not get one cent of new credit flowing or finance a single new job.</P>
        <P>AIB and Bank of Ireland have faced down the Government and have been given until the end of the year to raise new capital.  Bank of Ireland is making progress but AIB has made no progress.  In the meantime, these banks will be hoarding their capital and squeezing their customers to try to protect their independence while the uncertainty regarding the ultimate taxpayer commitment to these banks will go on.  The truth is that an incompetent and complicit Government has been strong-armed by the banks into bailing them out at massive long-term risk to the taxpayer, without any benefit in terms of supporting Irish businesses and households and without any mandate from the people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Through all of this we have not heard one word from the Government about job protection or creation, except for the odd scheme here and there that, as we discovered in recent days, is not working or, in some cases, has not even been implemented.  Bailing out our reckless banks is the only priority.  A book-keeping exercise to keep the EU Commission happy is the Government&rsquo;s priority.  It seems bailing out the 440,000 people unemployed in our country is much less urgent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are the issues which should be put to the people in a national election.  However, we are long enough in politics to know we are unlikely to get a national election in the near future.  The Government of Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and Independents will cling on as long as it can to ensure it will not have to face the wrath of the electorate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government does not have the necessary mandate to take the types of decision and to make the choices that are essential to give us hope for the future and to tackle the underlying problems.  The public want the opportunity to make that judgment.  In a recent poll in <i>The Irish Times</i>, 80% of people indicated that they wanted to see an election and the by-election seats filled.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the Government does not want to give the people a national election, it should at least ensure full democratic participation and representation in each of the 43 constituencies in which the people voted in 2007.  The constituents of Donegal South-West, Waterford, and Dublin South, where there are vacancies, are entitled to have their seats filled at the earliest possible opportunity.  By-elections in those constituencies would give the Government an opportunity to put its policies to those electorates, see what their verdict will be on its economic policy and prove that it has a mandate to carry on.  If the Government is confident that it is moving in the right direction and making the right decisions to deal with the country&rsquo;s economic and social difficulties, it should have no difficulty in asking the electorates of the constituencies where vacancies exist to cast their judgment on those policies.</P><Col N="74"/>
        <P>I ask the Green Party to back up its recent public musings on by-elections.  It will have an opportunity tomorrow night to vote for a Bill that will reform our political and electoral system.  There was much in the party&rsquo;s manifesto prior to the last election, in the subsequent review of the programme for Government and in various national conference speeches by the leader of the party, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to the effect that he would force Fianna F&aacute;il to introduce unprecedented electoral and political reforms.  These include banning corporate donations, changing the system of local and national government, changing the way in which we raise money locally for local government and giving autonomy to local councillors to implement those changes.  Although the Government has been in office for three years, we have still not seen the promised White Paper on local government reform.  In the same period, we have not seen any ban on corporate donations, except another promise to ban them in the revised programme for Government.  Three years into the Government&rsquo;s term in office, we have not seen any electoral commission established or any electoral reform proposed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  He talks the talk but does not walk the walk.  Either he is not able to get his policies through the Cabinet or Fianna F&aacute;il is deliberately blocking their implementation.  When he gets an opportunity, he should state which is the case.  As somebody who has talked a lot about electoral reform, he has delivered very little.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been a vacancy in Donegal South-West since 5 June 2009, 11 months and 21 days ago.  There has been a vacancy in Dublin South since February and in Waterford since March.  Although these vacancies exist, we should look to the future by establishing in the legislation a finite period in which by-elections must be held.  Six months is reasonable but if the Government proposes another period we will be certainly glad to hear it.  However, we are hearing nothing from the Minister on this issue.  Perhaps during the course of this debate, he will give us not just his musings on the matter but also his thoughts, hard won through the Cabinet.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned a mayoral election recently and actually wants a Super-Tuesday-type election in the autumn.  According to this model, the mayoral election to be held in Dublin, the by-elections, and even the referendum will have to be held on the same day to ensure cost-effectiveness and efficiency.  Consistent with this view, I take it the Minister has no principled opposition to what we propose on this side of the House tonight.  The by-elections will inevitably reduce the Government&rsquo;s slim majority but it will still have a majority of three.  A Government with a majority of one soldiered on from 1973 to 1977 and was very successful.  There was low inflation.  Even the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, Mr. Jack Lynch, acknowledged it was a very successful Government, obviously when the next election was over.  He proceeded to wreck the country with the 1977 manifesto, which he implemented.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, stated recently on RTE that he would prefer all elections to be held in the autumn of 2010.  Perhaps he will support this Bill in the House.</P>
        <P>The most important Green Party musing is that of Senator Dan Boyle, chairman of the party.  He stated on radio the by-elections should not be held as they would undermine the Government&rsquo;s mandate.  The Government has no mandate, nor does the Senator.  He was rejected by the people of Cork and got in through the back door as one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s 11 nominees under the list system that we have called Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  He is now deciding what Government policy should be on behalf of his party.  What does he mean by saying the by-elections would undermine the Government&rsquo;s mandate?  The people of the constituencies in question are entitled to full representation.  Neither Senator Boyle nor anyone in the Green <Col N="75"/>Party should be in a position to prevent the people of Dublin South, Waterford and Donegal South-West from having full representation in the House.</P>
        <P>The D&aacute;il arithmetic may be difficult for the Government but it will still have a majority if the by-elections are held.  The fundamental principle of what we are trying to enshrine in this Bill, and in respect of which we are seeking support in the House, is that there should be a finite period in which any casual vacancy that arises in a constituency must be filled.  I ask the House to support this measure as a modest electoral reform.</P>

	<P>I acknowledge the role of the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Hogan in my being able to contribute tonight.  It is an injustice in our system that I am not able to do so in my own right.  Last Thursday, I proposed an electoral (amendment) Bill similar to this but the system precludes me from advancing it at this time.  Hence, it is Deputy Hogan&rsquo;s Bill  we are debating now.</P>
        <P>I was elected in a by-election and, therefore, have first-hand experience.  It was the death of my predecessor, the late Mr. Tony Gregory, that caused the by-election in Dublin Central.  Mr. Gregory, as Members know, was a tireless worker in the constituency, as was borne out by the fact that he was re-elected consistently over 27 years.  His death on 2 January 2009 meant that Dublin Central was left without one of its entitlements.  Four months passed and these comprised a time of anxiety and uncertainty in the constituency for Mr. Gregory&rsquo;s constituents and his supporters.  At that stage, Dublin South had been without its full complement of public representatives for a much longer period.  Today Dublin South is again without a Deputy, as are Waterford and Donegal South-West.  We are approaching the first anniversary of Donegal South-West lacking its full entitlement.</P>
        <P>We either believe in our parliamentary or democratic system or we do not.  If we do, we should ensure all our constituents have their full entitlement of Deputies.  Are we approaching a system similar to that affecting public sector workers in that when one leaves a post, one is not replaced?  It appears this is the system in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I have heard of by-elections as the wrong way to fill a D&aacute;il vacancy and that they are a distraction from the work and business of governing and policy-making.  This time last year, I was in the middle of a by-election campaign in Dublin Central.  There was also one in Dublin South.  This did not equate with political instability and I did not see the country grinding to a halt.  The D&aacute;il continued its business, the Government governed and the Opposition opposed.  The by-elections came and went and Dublin Central and Dublin South then had their full complement of Deputies.</P>
        <P>Alternatives to by-elections are suggested.  Options are to choose the next person in line from the most recent election, or to avail of the count-back system or co-option.  Co-option would be just a further accentuation of the political dynasty syndrome in the Chamber.  A by-election is the fairest and most democratic way to fill a vacancy.  I cannot understand why we do not have legislation on this issue.  My Bill sets time limits, both minimum and maximum, for the holding of by-elections.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is holding up or preventing the by-elections?  I read an article in a newspaper at the weekend in which the correspondent stated by-elections are &ldquo;undemocratic and their outcomes unrepresentative because they give voters in a particular constituency a distorted electoral impact.&rdquo;  Are we in a democracy or just paying lip-service to it?  It is the right of the voter in a democracy to vote for the candidate of his or her choice.  It appears we are afraid of democracy.</P><Col N="76"/>
        <P>Moving the writ for the by-election is at the whim of the political party or parties in power, and they do so at a time of optimum value to them.  This is not good enough and not democratic.  It is not just or fair to leave a constituency bereft of its entitlement.  To the contention that there is a strong trend whereby by-elections produce results against whatever parties are in Government, I say, &ldquo;So what.&rdquo;  There is no just, valid or fair reason for depriving a constituency of its full complement of public representatives.  The present Government may not want by-elections in the foreseeable future in terms of political benefit or otherwise, immediate or long-term, but it may be in opposition at some time and clamouring for a by-election.  Moving the writs for by-elections should be out of the hands of the political party in power and made subject to legislation.  By achieving this, we would eliminate uncertainty and doubt and circumstances in which constituencies do not have their full complement of Deputies.</P>
        <P>I would obviously prefer to be developing my own Bill but at this point I am supporting Deputy Hogan.  I appeal to all Members, regardless of the political party to which they belong, to support the Bill in the interests of fairness, justice and democracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful for the opportunity to address the important matter of by-elections and I thank and commend Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan for raising this matter.  She is following in the great tradition of the late Tony Gregory, who we miss in debates such as this.  However, the legislation is about the need for people to be able to elect their own Deputy.  Blocking or postponing an election should never be an option in a so-called &ldquo;free society&rdquo;.  This is almost as bad as preventing Independent Members from speaking in the House.  The country and the D&aacute;il are either democratic or they are not.  It is apparent the House is not and this is a national scandal, particularly in these difficult times when those of us who want to represent senior citizens, the unemployed, public servants and the sick and disabled are prevented from expressing their views and concerns, which is the key to this debate.</P>
        <P>Let there be no misunderstanding that the failure to hold by-elections is wrong and it is totally undemocratic.  Many of us may not like the results but this is about the people&rsquo;s choice.  People died for the right to vote in an independent Ireland, which is something we should all reflect on in this debate.  A series of independent candidates will run in the by-elections.  For example, an excellent independent councillor is ready to stand and serve in Waterford.  Councillor Joe Conway has a great local record and a great vision for the country.  I urge people to be independent and to vote independent.</P>
        <P>These by-elections are necessary.  Thousands of independent councillors work for their constituents without recourse to political party structures all over Europe.  More than 120 independent councillors were elected in the last local elections in Ireland.  I believe that independent representation, free from political party influence, is more likely to be closer to the people and more responsive to their expectations than local authorities and the Government.  It is important that independent candidates hold their nerve in the broader debate and are not bullied by the major political parties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Currently, a time limit or other compelling factor cannot be used to require a by-election to be held when a seat becomes vacant due to the death or resignation of a sitting Deputy.  Article 16.2.2&deg; of the Constitution requires that there be one Deputy for every 20,000 to 30,000 of the population.  There is no constitutional reason the law or Standing Orders should fail to provide that a by-election be held within a specific period of a casual vacancy occurring.  The purpose of the legislation, which I strongly support, is to ensure a constituency is not left without a Deputy for an indefinite period.  It is the constitutional right of our citizens to be adequately <Col N="77"/>represented in the D&aacute;il.  Under the present system, a constituency may be left without a Deputy indefinitely and that is why I urge people of all political persuasions to support the legislation.  Some day the Government parties will be in Opposition and by-elections will be on the agenda.  They will value the right to ask the people to vote.</P>
        <P>It is important that democracy is taken seriously.  There is much discussion in the House about reform and the need for radical change in the future, which I support because it is essential, but part of any radical change is support for this legislation.  It addresses the issue of democracy and it will give people the right to express their views, particularly in the current economic climate.  I urge all Members to support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to support the Bill and I congratulate Deputy Hogan on bringing it before the House.</P>
        <P>Article 16.7 of the Constitution puts forward the proposition that casual vacancies of D&aacute;il seats will be filled and this shall be regulated in accordance with law.  We want to bring forward a law to ensure such vacancies are filled within six months.  It is anticipated in the Constitution that they would be filled and by-elections would take place.  The Government or any other government cannot put off by-elections indefinitely.  If the legislation is accepted, it will ensure in future that governments of any hue will be obliged to hold by-elections within six months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Article 28.4.1&deg; of the Constitution states, &ldquo;The Government shall be responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;.  I remind Ministers of this.  I examined the role of the executive and the role of parliament throughout Europe and I found that Ireland and one or two other countries have the weakest parliaments in Europe.  The Government controls the D&aacute;il almost completely.  The Executive decides what is debated, when it is debated and how it is debated.  It can guillotine legislation and it sets the agenda, except in regard to Private Members&rsquo; business, although it even has the power to regulate that or take it back if it wishes.  This is not the case in many other European parliaments and it is a dangerous scenario.  This is highlighted by the fact the Government can decide whether by-elections are held.  Setting the agenda in a parliament is important.  For example, the parliament determines the agenda in the Netherlands while in Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Sweden, the president of the parliament, following consultation with party groups, decides the agenda and that cannot be challenged but in Ireland and the UK the government decides the agenda.</P>
        <P>With regard to the legislative process throughout Europe, there is either a great deal of government control or little government control.  This is interesting because in Ireland, Spain and the UK, a plenary session of parliament decides on principles before committee debate and this leaves little room for substantial change.  In other words, the government brings legislation before the parliament and there is little room for debate afterwards.  That is not the case, for instance, in other countries such as Austria, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland where committee debates are held before a plenary session presents a final solution.  In our Parliament, the Government has huge control and that is not right.  We need to redress the balance regarding powers of the Executive and the Parliament.</P>
        <P>It has been proposed that the three by-elections, the Dublin mayoral election and the children&rsquo;s rights referendum be held on the same day in the autumn and I agree that should be the case.  Some people say that will be a distraction but it would be the opposite because it would focus minds.  We have a discerning and sophisticated electorate.  Let us give the electorate the opportunity to have their say.  Democracy is about rule by the people.  When I go into classrooms to talk to students the first comment I make is, &ldquo;You are our bosses&rdquo;, and we must <Col N="78"/>never forget that.  I am concerned that Fianna F&aacute;il has forgotten that the people rule supreme in this State and by denying them their say it is acting like a pseudo-dictatorship, which is serious.</P>
        <P>I ask the Government parties to take this legislation on board and in their almost all-powerful position in this Parliament to go along with this for the sake of democracy, which is a fragile flower in any country.  It is only right that the people should have their say.  If the Government parties believe their policies are right, just and fair, they should not be afraid to put them to the people in the by-elections.  That is what democracy is about and the people can decide whether they agree with them.  If the Government parties win any of the by-elections, they will have a mandate for their policies.  Ultimately, this is what it is about.</P>
        <P>Sooner or later the Government will have to face the people.  My challenge to the Government is to do it sooner rather than later.  Let us do it this year, in the autumn, before the weather gets too bad to enable people to canvass and so on and especially if we are to have the all-important children&rsquo;s referendum, which should be held at the same time.</P>
        <P>I have been talking about D&aacute;il reform here for quite some time, including reform of the procedures of the House.  That is another angle to this.  The Government has been talking about this since I came here, 13 years ago, but nothing has happened.  Even the Taoiseach throws his hands in the air quite often and says the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s procedures should be changed.  It is in his hands to work with us to change the procedures in here, to make the House work better and make it more efficient and effective for the people we all serve.  We are the servants of the people, not their masters, and Fianna F&aacute;il would be very wise to remember that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to support the Fine Gael Bill so ably proposed by my colleague, Deputy Phil Hogan.  I should mention the companion Bill, at the same time, as proposed by the Independents, Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan and co-sponsored by Deputies Joe Behan and Finian McGrath.  Essentially the principles in both Bills are the same. </P>
        <P>Fine Gael believes there should be a provision whereby the by-election would, by law, have to be held within six months of a vacancy arising.  Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s Bill would require the by-election to be held not less than three months and not more than six months after the declaration of a vacancy, so essentially the Bills are very much along the same lines.</P>
        <P>What is happening at present is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.  It could be strongly argued that it is also contrary to the letter of the Constitution.  Article 16 deals with the issue of membership of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Article 16.2 provides that the number of Members shall, from time to time, be fixed by law, but the total number shall not be fixed at less than one Member for each 30,000 of the population.  That is a fixed provision in the Constitution.</P>
        <P>Article 16.2.3&deg; deals with the ratio between Members and clearly states:  &ldquo;The ratio between the numbers of members to be elected at any time for each constituency  shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country&rdquo;.  At present, because these three by-elections remain outstanding, the ratio per Member in Donegal South-West is 35,519.  That population is being shared between the two surviving Members in that constituency.  The ratio in Waterford is 35,510.  Both are in breach of the constitutional requirement as regards the 30,000 of the population per Member.  In Dublin South the current ratio is 29,676, marginally below the 30,000 figure.  In this situation where there are three by-elections outstanding and we have these constitutional requirements regarding the maximum population applicable to the membership of the D&aacute;il as well as the requirement to have the ratio as far as practicable uniform throughout the country, I would say the Government is in breach of the Constitution by its refusal to agree to by-elections being held.</P><Col N="79"/>
        <P Just="Left">The longer this continues the clearer the breach is and in the event, there is a constitutional imperative on the Government to agree to hold these by-elections.  The way to do it is to provide for it by law &mdash; either agree them or have a provision in our laws as to the time they are to be held.</P>
        <P>There is a provision in the Electoral Act, but it does not specify the time limit.  Therefore, the purpose of the Fine Gael Bill is to provide for that time limit and that is what we are asking the House to do tonight.  Article 16.7 covers this issue when it states:  &ldquo;Subject to the foregoing provision of this Article, elections for membership of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, including the filing of casual vacancies, shall be regulated in accordance with law&rdquo;.  It does not say &ldquo;may be&rdquo;, but &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; regulated in accordance with law.  Again, there is a constitutional requirement to this effect.</P>
        <P>The various provisions I have mentioned do not provide for any discretion but rather indicate that since that is the situation, this is what shall be done.  The Government is not compliant with those provisions.  On that basis I would ask it to think twice about any opposition it might have to this Bill or to the holding of these by-elections.  I will say, clearly, that somebody will go to the Supreme Court on this issue with a very arguable case on the points I have made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">How we are to hold by-elections is a matter for debate.  We are discussing that in the Joint Committee on the Constitution where we be will talking again, tomorrow, on some of these issues.  We have the traditional PR-STV system in Ireland and we have had some very good contributions from various people as to whether that system should be changed.  It is interesting that Professor Michael Gallagher of TCD has looked at the count-back systems in Malta and Tasmania, which would not work here at all.  He is also looking at co-option, such as what we have with local authorities, and the European Parliament system, which is perhaps the one we might opt for if we were to change.  He summed up by saying: &ldquo;It may be that, to paraphrase Winston Churchill on democracy, by-elections are the worst possible method of filling casual vacancies in this country, with the exception of all the others&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We shall be hearing more of this in the committee on the Constitution.  There was also a very interesting article by Professor Gary Murphy of DCU.  He gave interesting evidence to the committee covering the history, background, practicalities and possible alternatives.  Ultimately, his submission concluded that filling casual vacancies via PR-STV might be as good a method as any.</P>
        <P>That is the method but the question is more about procedure, the process and, most importantly, the timing.  It is no good to have a process on which ultimately we all agree unless it can be triggered.  There is no procedure in law at the moment for triggering that process, other than by way of a vote in the House &mdash; and this can be postponed indefinitely.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to go into the Government&rsquo;s reasons for its approach to this issue.  It is clear that this Government is clinging on by its fingernails, afraid of its life to face the people on any issue.  The ludicrous spoofing we heard when the writs were moved would pass for comedy, but I am not getting into that.</P>
        <P>What the Government is doing in regard to this issue is in breach of the Constitution.  There is a constitutional imperative that by-elections should be held within a reasonable time.  The Government is breaching that and, in regard to both the spirit and the letter of the Constitution, it is not acting constitutionally.</P>

	<P>The Opposition Members have lately begun talking about electoral reform, and the party opposite has produced some modest proposals in that regard.  However, today its members have decided to introduce a Bill that focuses on a single issue in isolation from all other aspects of electoral reform.  The proposal would serve only to remove the discretion of the D&aacute;il and diminish the role of the national Parliament.  One has to wonder why they never thought to introduce such a measure when they had the opportunity to do so in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>This Bill proposes to amend section 39 of the Electoral Act 1992 to compel the holding of a by-election not later than six months after a vacancy occurs.  The Bill recognises and retains the reference to the role of the D&aacute;il in directing that a by-election be held but then swiftly undermines that role by forcing the D&aacute;il to act within six months.  This mechanical approach to holding by-elections does not take account of unforeseen events or prevailing circumstances which may not be conducive to holding elections within that time frame.  I can think of two emergency health situations in recent years &mdash; swine flu and foot and mouth disease &mdash; which could have led to the deferment of elections.</P>

	<P>Members of this House are democratically elected by the people.  I see this Bill as diminishing the role of our national Parliament and I disagree with the approach in the Bill.</P>
        <P>In any event, this is an issue which should be addressed as part of a wider systematic review of the electoral system and not in a piecemeal and isolated way as proposed in this Bill.  My <Col N="81"/>commitment and that of the Government to electoral reform is on the record and is reflected in the agreed programme for Government.  Our electoral reform programme is ambitious and wide-ranging, covering legislative reform, institutional development, Oireachtas reform and major changes in local government.  We have already delivered on some of these commitments.  I published the Green Paper on local government, Stronger Local Democracy &mdash; Options for Change, in April 2008.  This was followed by an extensive programme of national consultation for the purpose of informing the preparation of the White Paper on local government.  A dedicated Cabinet committee is finalising the major strategic issues for inclusion in the White Paper, which will be published as soon as possible following the completion of the committee&rsquo;s deliberations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Members of the House know, the Green Paper proposed a regional mayor for Dublin to meet the strategic challenges faced by the city and county.  In February of this year, I published for consultation the general scheme of the legislation to provide for such a mayor.  It is my intention that the election of the mayor should take place this year.</P>

	<P>I agree with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year the Government moved swiftly and decisively to enact legislation which regulated, for the first time, spending and donations at local elections; all in all, that was a good day&rsquo;s work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme for Government envisages that an independent electoral commission would take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight, implement modern and efficient electoral practices and revise constituency boundaries.  The commission would take charge of compiling a new national rolling electoral register, take over the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission with regard to election spending, and examine the issue of financing in the political system.  The commission would also be invited to examine and make recommendations for changes to the electoral system for D&aacute;il elections, including the number of Deputies and their means of election.  Issues to do with by-elections, such as how they might be triggered &mdash; and, indeed, the merits or otherwise of filling casual vacancies by way of by-elections or by alternative means &mdash; would be pertinent to such an examination.  I will return to the issue of by-elections and electoral theory, as this is critical to the debate.</P>
        <P>To assist in the consideration of the issues involved in the establishment of an electoral commission, I commissioned a report by an expert group from UCD, and I published the preliminary study for comment 12 months ago.  I must say that the response to the consultation was somewhat disappointing.  While the formal closing date for written submissions has passed, I still welcome and will consider any views and observations offered by interested individuals or organisations.  I note that the Fine Gael Party did not make a submission to the expert group.</P>
        <P>The preliminary study prepared for me by the UCD group gives an overview of the present arrangements for electoral administration in Ireland and an examination of the position in other countries.  It suggests options for an electoral commission in Ireland and draws some conclusions.</P>
        <P>The key findings of the UCD report are that the proposed electoral commission should be responsible for maintaining the register of political parties; it should also assume responsibility for the electoral register with a view to introducing a rolling, individual register; and the func<Col N="82"/>tions currently carried out by the constituency commission for D&aacute;il and European elections should be transferred to the electoral commission.  The study notes that current Irish arrangements for the administration of nominations, polling schemes, the polling process and the counting of votes have several distinct advantages.  It states that the devolved character of the process is the key to its success and recommends that it should not be tampered with.  Even with the establishment of an electoral commission, therefore, we could still be in a situation in which electoral administration would be the responsibility of a number of bodies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report recommends that, pending the outcome of a review of the law relating to the regulation of party and election funding, a single body should combine the functions currently performed by the Standards in Public Office Commission and the registrar of political parties, and that the final powers and functions of the electoral commission with regard to party and election funding should be determined by the Oireachtas following a review undertaken by the commission and Oireachtas review of its recommendations in that respect.</P>
        <P>The report recommends that an electoral commission be given the power to conduct and commission research.  The report notes that the electoral commission would be independent in the performance of its functions, but that any such provision should not preclude an appropriate degree of accountability on the part of the electoral commission to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and to the Oireachtas.  It recommends that certain specific policy-making functions should be reserved to the Minister; for example, fixing the date of polling, deciding whether to approve a specific form of electronic voting recommended by the commission, or proposing changes to the electoral system.  In those specific cases, the role of the commission would be to advise the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment can be set out in two parts: the reform of electoral administration, and electoral reform.  With regard to the former, it is intended that the new electoral commission will take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight and implement modern, efficient practices for the conduct of elections.  It would become a standing constituency commission for the revision of constituency boundaries and would decide these boundaries.  It would take charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register, administer the voter registration process and run voter education programmes.  It would assume the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission with regard to electoral expenditure and would be provided with enhanced powers of inspection.</P>
        <P>With regard to electoral reform, it is intended that the new electoral commission will examine the issue of financing of the political system and recommend revised guidelines on the declaration of donations for political purposes.  It will advise on mechanisms to increase the participation of women in political life, including the use of additional criteria for public funding which encourage more women and less well represented groups.  In addition, it will make recommendations on the feasibility of extending the franchise for presidential elections to the Irish abroad and make recommendations on the possibility of extending the franchise for local elections to those aged 16 or over.</P>
        <P>The establishment of an independent electoral commission is not an insignificant move, and new legislation will be required to establish it.  For example, amending legislation will be required to transfer to the electoral commission a range of roles and responsibilities including those assigned to the Standards in Public Office Commission in electoral law, the roles and responsibilities of the constituency commission and the roles and responsibilities of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This will require changes to more then 20 primary Acts and to the associated regulations.</P><Col N="83"/>
        <P>The UCD study recommends that an electoral commission should be established through the enactment of an electoral commission Act.  This Act would amend and consolidate the law in this area, bringing together the law relating to referenda and elections to local authorities, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the European Parliament, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the Office of the President of Ireland.  This would be a major task and it is part of our considerations.  However, while putting in place the necessary groundwork for the electoral administration remit of the electoral commission will take time, I do not want to see the electoral reform agenda delayed unnecessarily.  For this reason I am now giving consideration to establishing an electoral commission on a non-statutory basis to report on the electoral reform agenda set out in the renewed programme for Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is being done three years too late.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution has an important and valuable input to our overall electoral reform considerations.  In the course of its examination of the system used for the election of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the committee has considered issues in respect of the administration and functioning of Ireland&rsquo;s electoral system generally.  I was glad to have the opportunity to make a presentation to the committee last March and to hear members&rsquo; views.  I look forward to the committee&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>Returning to the issue of by-elections and electoral theory, it is interesting to note the views of electoral experts who appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution last February with regard to the filling of casual vacancies in the D&aacute;il by way of by-elections.  There are strong arguments in principle against having by-elections at all in a situation where parliament is elected by proportional representation.  It was noted at that committee hearing that it is relatively unusual for a country that uses proportional representation to fill casual vacancies in this way.  The argument is that all electors in the State voting at a general election determine the composition of parliament and the representation of each party in it.  Therefore, it is not appropriate that the balance of representation should be changed by the electors of one constituency who may make up less than 2% of the total electorate.  By-elections can and do change the balance of parliament, bring down governments and precipitate general elections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is the answer; the Government is afraid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>That said, a key argument for retaining the current system is that it is easy for voters to understand.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are various alternative systems available but, as with all systems, there are arguments for and against.  One of the alternatives considered by some experts to be perhaps the most feasible is the method used in the European Parliament elections, as provided for in the European Parliament Elections Act 1997.  It involves parties putting forward a list of substitutes, with the first on the list stepping up in the event of a casual vacancy.  The obvious advantage of this for Ireland is that there is no delay in filling the casual vacancy and the inter-party balance in the D&aacute;il would not be affected.  On the other hand, the list system is open to potential abuse and could be used, at least theoretically, to parachute a relatively unknown person into the D&aacute;il on the back of a popular candidate.  Another alternative, advocated by some, is the count-back method which would involve revisiting the ballot papers for the original general election.  I understand this method is used in Malta and I look forward to seeing whether the joint committee makes any suggestions on it in its forthcoming report.</P>
        <P>As I said, there are many alternatives and there may be more than those to which I have adverted.  However, I appreciate that this is not the forum to debate the merits of different <Col N="84"/>electoral systems.  My intention is to give a flavour of the detailed analysis and debate that is required in deciding on how best to take forward our approach to by-elections.  I am not persuaded that tinkering with the by-election provisions in the existing legislation, without fundamental electoral reform, is the best option.  It is not practical to talk about piecemeal change without having regard to the wider implications.  This proposal needs more measured consideration as part of a broader systematic review of the electoral system.  Moreover, the Government would not be serving the public interest, nor the democratic process itself, if it accepted the Bill without sufficient thought, planning and consultation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I said, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution is due to publish its report on the election of Members of the D&aacute;il shortly.  Given the detailed debate and expert analysis of electoral theory and systems undertaken by the committee, I expect its work to provide a valuable contribution to the debate on by-elections.  I await that report with keen interest.  I hope the Opposition parties will show a unified approach and a willingness to engage on the wider electoral reform agenda that will best serve the needs of the country in the coming years.  I am open to consideration of longer term options in regard to the broader electoral reform agenda and will not be drawn on hasty proposals that could have unintended consequences down the road.  For the reasons I have set out, I do not accept the Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; Bill currently before the House.</P>
        <P>In respect of the three by-elections currently outstanding, I have made my personal views on the timing of these polls clear on a number of occasions.  These matters will, however, be discussed by Government and will ultimately be a matter for the Oireachtas to decide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill, although the Minister&rsquo;s fine speech has left little for me to say.  As per tradition, I thank the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Hogan, for his work on the legislation.  In one sense I cannot wait to see, if and when Deputy Hogan becomes Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in a different type of government, what actions he takes in this area.  In this instance, I suspect he would do exactly as the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has done.  However, we may have to wait a while to find out whether I am right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not want to say anything that will get me in trouble but having listened carefully to the contributions by Deputies Finian McGrath and Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan, I am eager that some accommodation be found, although I am aware that other Independents may have a different view.  I genuinely support calls for Independents to have more opportunities to contribute.  I am genuine in saying this.  It has often been said of me that I should have been an Independent community candidate.  It is still said of me in Tallaght that I would probably top the poll in the next general election were I to stand as an Independent community candidate.  I do not take that view, however, and I am quite happy in the party I am in.  It is something I feel strongly about.  The Minister gets many mentions throughout my constituency of Dublin South-West and I am aware he gets many e-mails from people in Tallaght on planning issues.  He is well regarded in the area; people know his name and are happy to correspond with him.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to Green Party policy on the mayoral election in Dublin and the need for a directly elected mayor to meet what he described as the strategic challenges faced by the city and county.  I am glad he mentioned the county because sometimes when people talk about Dublin they are referring only to the city.  People think I was born and bred in Tallaght &mdash; I wish I was &mdash; but I was actually born in Dublin city.  During the election a constituent remarked that having been in Tallaght for 40 years, I really had not been there long at all.  That is my background.</P><Col N="85"/>
        <P>I feel strongly about the region because Dublin is about Dublin city, Fingal, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and particularly south County Dublin where I now live.  I was proud to be the millennium cathaoirleach of South Dublin County Council in 1999.  Members will be amused by my recollecting that I was about eight weeks into my stint when I had a heart attack, which slowed me up somewhat, although Chris Flood believed it was a great political move.  I am being flippant because it was a demanding period for me, but I have never looked back politically.  It did not do me any harm and, thank God, my health is good.</P>
        <P>I have always taken a major interest in my own Dublin region.  The Minister will be glad to know I have no ambitions to be Dublin mayor.</P>

	<P>The Minister is very good.  I take it as a compliment to my work when people say I should run for it.  I read articles in magazines and in <i>The Irish Times</i>, and therefore it must be true, listing me with revered big-name candidates.  I do not say that in a virtuous way but I take that as a compliment to my work.  I am happy to be a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy based in Tallaght and looking after the people of the whole of Dublin South-West, which is my focus, but I will be supporting the Minister&rsquo;s views on the election for Dublin mayor.  I look forward to that legislation and I give the Minister a guarantee that I will speak up for him when it comes forward.  </P>
        <P>I feel strongly about the position in that regard.  I look at other cities including New York, for example, where the mayor made a huge impression at the weekend.  It proves that the work can be done.  Boris Johnson appears to be a nice man too.  I recall exchanging correspondence with him when he was running for election and he told me he was interested in the development of the job.  He expressed a view about the Irish vote in a hand-written note.  The system and the model must be good.</P>
        <P>I had not intended to pick on Fine Gael because it is a nice quiet evening and I do not want to do that but listening to the Minister and the debate earlier I am reminded that my colleague, the Chief Whip, Deputy John Curran, spoke last week about political opportunism with regard to the Waterford by-election while at the same time not mentioning Dublin South.  I can talk about Dublin South because I share a boundary and live close to it.</P>
        <P>I had a high regard for George Lee.  I got into some trouble with Deputy Hogan&rsquo;s colleagues for offering him a desk at the time when he was under some pressure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Now we know what went wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a whole issue about big name candidates, and I know that issue will crop up in the mayoral election.  I often say that I am neither a pretty face nor a big name and therefore I have to do things differently but I have no difficulty with pretty faces and big names being elected to this House.  I will not argue one way or another.  One of the things I find about this D&aacute;il is that we are a broad church, even within parties, made up of all sorts of different personalities.  I find a lot in common with colleagues not only on my benches and those of the Green Party but on all sides, which is fair enough.</P>
        <P>The Minister made reference also to the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution, which he tells me is expected next month.  The committee, under the skilled chairmanship of my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Ardagh, examined the system used for the election of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I was a contributor to that work, along with many others, and it will be fascinating to see what the report states and how they grasp the various nettles which <Col N="86"/>must be grasped in regard to that issue.  I wish Deputy Se&aacute;n Ardagh and all his colleagues well in that regard.</P>
        <P>In that context I am reminded that there is a commitment in the programme for Government of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party to consider options for the timing of local authority, D&aacute;il, Seanad and European elections and that this should include the possibility of mid-term elections and running some elections on a staggered or rolled basis to ensure elections do not fall on the same date for every candidate or chamber.  I am not sure whether I can get my head around all of that but I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s proposals in that regard.</P>
        <P>I was first elected to Dublin County Council in 1991 and without an election became a member of South Dublin County Council in 1994.  An election was not held until 1999.  Who wants an election?  The Deputies opposite can point their fingers at me and say I did not protest at the time but nevertheless I thought it was a very long period.  I am aware there were reasons for that.  It was about the reorganisation of local government.  There were three different Governments in place during that period and there were issues to be dealt with but I felt at the time that it was too long a period without an election.</P>
        <P>The Sinn F&eacute;in leader made the point some weeks ago during the general election in Britain &mdash; I do not say this in a mischievous way &mdash; that elections give us all an opportunity to knock on doors and meet people.  I must say I am not inclined to wait for those opportunities.  I tend to be out and about, as I know is the case with most colleagues.  However, that period from 1991 to 1999 proved to me that there should be some discipline as far as the term is concerned and I am glad that is now the position.  Whatever about the criticism, the fact is that the D&aacute;il term is set for five years.  It does not go beyond that and it is right that we leave it to the discretion of the Taoiseach to decide when the election will take place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I compliment Deputy Hogan on his work on the Bill and in saying that I hope that does not get him into any trouble.  Since becoming a D&aacute;il Deputy eight years ago I have taken the view that it is good to engage in Private Members&rsquo; debates.  Some of the debate is not always sensible, and nobody will be offended by that, but I have always regarded it as a good opportunity to deal with the issues of the day.  Despite what the Independents might say, as a humble, little known backbencher it is sometimes just as demanding to get time to speak on major issues.  That is the reason I always welcome the opportunity to speak.  Without patronising the Minister, I am pleased he shared a few minutes of his time and I feel good about that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>

	<P>The latter ten minutes will be tomorrow night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to begin by thanking Fine Gael for bringing this Bill before the House this evening and commending Deputy Hogan on a Bill which has a simple and measurable intent.</P>
        <P>Reform can be looked at in three different ways.  We can follow the big bang theory where a specific Minister decides that he or she will reform a number of measures at once or we can have the incremental approach where we engage in a reform process piece by piece over a period of time.  I believe that what is being presented before the House this evening is very much the latter.  It is a simple measurable immediate measure that can ensure that by-elections take place within a specific period of time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The third reform option is where we follow what I call the &ldquo;big blank&rdquo; theory.  The &ldquo;big blank&rdquo; is what we have been getting from the Minister, Deputy Gormley since he came to office.  We will possibly see a White Paper later this year, but whether it will ever be implemented and whether it will take the format of previous White Papers remains to be seen.  We are hearing much talk of reform, but before the Minister this evening is an opportunity to engage and accept one measure of reform.</P>
        <P>In his speech this evening, the Minister stated he had some concerns about the proposal and that the six-month derogation was a difficulty for him.  I would challenge him this evening to state that the Government will accept the Bill in its intent and at a later stage amend it so that emergency situations, such as the foot and mouth disease crisis, could put a deferment on it but that this House, in principle, accepts that no seat in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will be left vacant for more than six months.  That remedies the difficulty the Minister brought before the House this evening.  If he believes that it is a genuine difficulty, here is a response to it I have given him and he can now let the Bill proceed.</P>
        <P>The position to date has resulted in this issue being debated repeatedly.  Since I came to the House in 2007, I think this is my third or fourth time speaking on the issue of by-elections.  During that period I have heard Ministers of State and Ministers come in here with the most bizarre of excuses as to why a by-election should not be called.  Two weeks ago Minister of State, Deputy Curran gave some excuse that we had to focus on the economy and that the elections would be a distraction.  There was some other issue of nonsense from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan, that the children&rsquo;s referendum would be contaminated if there were concurrent elections on that day.  In both cases, it was a direct insult to the intelligence of the electorate in this country.</P>
        <P>The reality of the situation is that by-elections are a matter of fact.  To date, we have witnessed two by-elections in this House and we have the issue of three more before us at present.  Regrettably, by-elections happen due to the death of a Member, but they also happen due to resignations.  By-elections now almost always happen as a consequence of results of European elections, which are on a five-year cycle.  We know when the next European election will occur.  It will occur in four years time, some time in June.  The likelihood is that at least one candidate will be a Member of this House and he or she will be elected to the European Parliament.  If one looks back over the past European elections, one will see that such is the case.  Why not <Col N="89"/>legislate proactively for something rather than allow the difficulties that arise from inaction come before the House, as they have this evening?</P>
        <P>In essence, this is a problem that has long been before this House to which a solution has long been overdue and a solution has been brought before this House this evening.  It is a solution that is simple, immediate and measurable.  Put simply, it ensures that the democratic deficit that it is created in this House through the result of a single seat being vacant gets address.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At present, there are three seats unoccupied in this Chamber.  Regardless of the constituencies in which these vacant seats are situated, it could be in my constituency of Cork South-Central besides Donegal South-West, Dublin South or Waterford, the principle of this is not geography; it is that there is a democratic deficit in this House where a constituency is being denied its full representation.  It beggars belief to hear the Minister come in and give alternative explanations that defy that single fact, that there are three empty seats in this House that should be filled within the lifetime of the Government.  Sadly, I do not think that will happen.</P>
        <P>I have listened to the Taoiseach in recent days and weeks comment upon this.  When being questioned on it, he states it is a matter for the D&aacute;il.  Unfortunately, the Taoiseach is telling a big fib in the media because it is a matter, not for the D&aacute;il but for Government under the present structure.  The Government has no appetite for a by-election.  The Taoiseach should desist from stating that it is a matter for the D&aacute;il because he is not being truthful with the public and he is certainly not being truthful with the electorate in each of those constituencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch will be aware that he should not cast aspersions on the Taoiseach in that way.  It is not orderly to do so.  I am sure he will quickly withdraw.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I will amend my comments to state that the comments made by the Taoiseach to my understanding are inaccurate when he states that it is a matter for the D&aacute;il because what we are witnessing in here this evening is that it is actually a matter decided by Government.</P>
        <P>Deputy Hogan is a far taller man than me.  As someone of smaller stature, I grew up with the notion that if one went into the school yard, one took on those bigger rather than smaller than you.  I will get to Fianna F&aacute;il in a moment.  Sometimes when there is a smaller rascal annoying you, you must address them as well, and that has been the approach of the Green Party in the Chamber this evening.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke of flexibility in his speech this evening.  There is flexibility and there is stretching something beyond credibility, which is what the Minister&rsquo;s speech did.  It was a stretch beyond credibility.</P>
        <P>We heard a number of red herrings.  He took us to Malta and some other regions &mdash; anywhere except Donegal, Waterford and Dublin.  He was off to Malta, the commission and everywhere else.</P>
        <P>He spoke of a situation where elections change Governments.  Where I come from, elections are all about the establishment and changing of Governments.  Even in this country, not so long ago a Government changed because of two by-elections in Cork city.</P>

	<P>Democracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The general public knew that when they were going to the poll that day.  In fact, what happened on that day is that the people of Cork reflected the national mood across the country.  When the Minister states here that he does not trust a particular constitu<Col N="90"/>ency, what he is saying, in effect, is that he does not trust the national public mood.  Ultimately, what we are debating here is a matter of confidence or, more accurately, an absence and lack of confidence by Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Three seats have been vacant for unacceptably long periods.  These vacancies, which are in Donegal South-West, Dublin South and Waterford, date back to February and March of this year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is clear that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party are running scared of the electorate and there is now a distinct possibility that there may be no by-election writs brought before us until this D&aacute;il sees itself through to its final conclusion.  That is an affront to democracy and it is a direct slap in the face of every citizen and member of the voting public in those three constituencies and every other voter in the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister may well dress this up and state that it will distract Government and could lead to some destabilisation of the economy, but the truth is the Government is rattled and scared and afraid to face the public.  In fact, so afraid is Fianna F&aacute;il that it is not merely afraid of the general public but afraid of its own membership.  It will not hold a party conference this year for fear of what will come off the floor inside its own conference.</P>
        <P>What we are witnessing with Fianna F&aacute;il is a series of regional love-ins or, as we might call them, &ldquo;hug-ins&rdquo;, where the only issue on the agenda is &ldquo;have a go at Gilmore&rdquo; motions.  They come out at 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. after being huddled inside in their rooms and have a go at my party leader.</P>
        <P>What Fianna F&aacute;il needs is a big group hug in one of these meetings because any level of confidence and self-esteem has certainly disappeared from them, particularly, as I stated, as witnessed by the absence of a party conference this year.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il might be punch-drunk.  It might need to be put into the recovery position and the best recovery position I can think of is the Opposition benches.  The passing of this Bill may not deliver the knock-out punch this Government needs but I assure the House it will lead to a standing count that will ultimately result in this Government being out of power.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Labour Party for giving me ten minutes speaking time.</P>
        <P>To a great extent this debate is the same debate we had last week on the Waterford by-election and the previous week on the Donegal South-West constituency by-election.  It is an indication not only of the feeling on this side of the House among the Opposition parties that the Government has an obligation to allow the electorate in those constituencies the right to fill the existing vacancies but also of the desire on the part of voters in those constituencies to have the opportunity to cast their verdict in mid-term on an increasingly unpopular Government.  One cannot but be reminded that the failure to have these by-elections is probably a result of fear in the Government parties.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The reasons I gave last week with regard to the contrast between the rapidity with which a Seanad by-election was called and the delay in moving the writs for the current D&aacute;il vacancies bear repeating, as do the political reasons which have to do with this Government&rsquo;s fear of the electorate and its reluctance to put the picture emerging from the opinion polls to a real test.  Most informed people believe the reason these by-elections have not been called is because the Government fears it will be decimated at the polls.  It knows that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party have little or no hope of winning any of the by-elections.  As I said last week, the fear or knowledge that one is going to lose an election is hardly a valid excuse in a democracy for avoiding to call one.</P><Col N="91"/>
        <P>It would be appropriate to take the power away from the sitting Government and to remove from it the means to delay calling by-elections as it is currently doing.  A period of six months, as proposed in the Fine Gael Bill, would be more than sufficient time to elapse between the vacancy arising and the by-election being held and would ensure the electorate in the constituency where the vacancy exists is given the opportunity within a reasonable timeframe to allow an election to be organised to fill the seat.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having praised Fine Gael for bringing this Bill forward, I must also, however, make some small criticism of it.  The criticism has to do with the Dublin South constituency and the vacancy there since its high profile recruit, George Lee, decided, after a remarkably short time, that Fine Gael was not the answer either to his own or the country&rsquo;s needs and he departed somewhat unceremoniously.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to rake over all the reasons why he may have made that decision but it could perhaps be said that Fine Gael in pressing the Government over its failure to move the writs for Waterford and Donegal while at the same time not moving the writ for Dublin South, might be regarded as somewhat hypocritical.  This Bill refers to a six month period of grace before the proposed legislation would make it mandatory to call a by-election for a vacancy.  George Lee only resigned in February so if this Bill was passed the by-election would not have to be called until before the end of July.  However, Fine Gael has rightly called for a by-election to be held in Waterford to replace former Minister and Deputy, Martin Cullen and it is less than three months since he decided to call it a day for health reasons.  Therefore, surely if Fine Gael is to be consistent it should also move the writ for Dublin South where, despite whatever problems it might be having in finding another candidate, it must be in pole position to retain that seat.  It would also, of course, provide another opportunity to allow a section of the electorate the opportunity to cast their votes on the current Government, which I have little doubt would once again be damning.</P>
        <P>It would also give Fine Gael plenty of time to persuade Eamon Dunphy or Bono or Giovanni Trappatoni or Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll, or whoever, to become its newest celebrity acquisition, given that none of its representatives in the constituency seems to be particularly enthusiastic and one person who was tipped to run has resigned altogether from politics.</P>

	<P>To return to the main object of attack, we could be here until the cows come home, going over the many reasons the electorate ought to be given an opportunity to cast its verdict on the current situation in the country that has left many people in an extremely bad way with regard to jobs, mortgages and making ends meet whether they are in employment or not.  Indeed since we were here last week there have been more large-scale job losses which underline the fact that while some countries, including apparently our nearest neighbour, are demonstrating signs of recovery, we are still in the midst of a severe crisis.  That crisis is part of a global downturn, which may or may not have run its course, but its impact has been massively exacerbated by the gross incompetence of financial and property speculators and the blind eye, indeed the encouragement, given to them by the main Government party.  It is clear that this Government has neither the imagination nor the will to do what is necessary to turn things around so that if the overall economic situation improves we will be able to take advantage of it rather than as we are at present, burdened with a massive debt incurred by those responsible for almost bringing the country to its knees.  The measures taken with regard to the banks and property mean that even if the economic situation improves we will still be left with the bill for those who were involved in speculation and this will greatly affect the ability of this country to take advantage of any upturn.</P>
        <P>NAMA and the banks&rsquo; bailout mean this Government has shifted the burden for the financial crisis away from those who were responsible for creating it and placed it on the shoulders of <Col N="92"/>the ordinary people who have been presented with a multi-billion euro bill, as well as also having to pay the price in reduced wages and cuts right across the public services from hospitals to schools.  It also means the Government is committed to an austerity programme.  There is neither the means nor the desire to take measures that might stimulate and encourage growth in the many areas of the economy that are still healthy or have the potential to be developed in order to create growth and employment.  The taxpayer has bailed out the banking system.  These same banks are in the process of repossessing and by extension, evicting misfortunate people who are victims of the grotesque methods adopted by the banking system, developers, speculators and the political elite in this State.</P>
        <P>The only means to reverse that situation is to remove this Government from power and to replace it with one that will reverse the current strategy and radically revise the manner in which the banks and property developers have been treated so it is they and not the ordinary people of the country who pay for the mess that they created and which will free up the resources required to pursue a more positive approach.  The only means to do that is through a general election, whenever that comes.  Naturally, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party wish to postpone the day of reckoning for as long as they can and that includes their refusal to call the by-elections in Dublin South, Donegal South-West and Waterford.  Not least of their worries is that losses in all of those three constituencies would place the survival of the Government in jeopardy and make it less likely that it will run its full term.  However, as I said earlier, that is not a valid excuse for not going ahead with those elections and I reiterate my call for them to do so.  I reiterate my call to Fine Gael to move the writ for Dublin South.  That will at least give the voters in those constituencies the opportunity to cast their verdict and hopefully speed up the removal of this Government from office.  I call on the House to support this Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office for facilitating me in raising this important issue, which concerns not alone my constituency but many others throughout the country.  I am a member of the Government party and have voted for various adjustments and cutbacks that were deemed necessary in the past few years.  I did so because I felt it was the right thing to do at the time.  I am not coming back as a hypocrite to say that we should not have done so and that we now want to give more money to these people.  I am simply asking the Government to examine this particular sector of our society.  From time to time and for different reasons, we describe various sections as being vulnerable.  Unlike many Members of this House, these people are not able-bodied and have a difficult path in life.</P>
        <P>I have been contacted recently by the parents of those who are attending the Brothers of Charity in Newcastle West, St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation in Charleville, St. Vincent&rsquo;s in Lisnagry and other such facilities in my constituency.  There is grave concern about plans that may have to be adopted in the coming months.  In the past few years, unfortunately, budgets have had to be reduced in this particular sector.  Despite this they were able to carry on and made the most of it.  They did their best and, to be fair to them, they are providing a wonderful service.  Nonetheless, I am concerned about the current situation.  We are facing into another difficult budget and will have to examine all sectors of society to see where savings can be made.  We are spending a huge amount of money in our health service.  Some years ago, the House decided to give a budget to the HSE, which is responsible for operating those services.  The people to <Col N="93"/>whom I have referred are dependent on judgment calls by the HSE as to the amount of funding they will receive at any given time.</P>
        <P>Sometimes I have to wonder when I see moneys being spent in other ways, of which we are all well aware, while parts of the health service must put up with very limited budgets.  Adults and children who use the services provided by the Brothers of Charity have been advised that, from September, the canteen will close, so they will have to bring packed lunches instead.  That really disturbs me, as it does also the parents of those involved.  Many of those parents are aged and have genuine concerns because they want to give the best to their sons and daughters.  They want to ensure that when they pass on to their eternal reward, the necessary services will be there to look after their children in comfort and dignity.  That is very important.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick, for attending the House to reply to this Adjournment matter.  We are talking about a very vulnerable group who have suffered quite enough through their disabilities.  I, for one, do not want to see them being asked to bring a packed lunch to their schools or workshops.  Surely to God we can find the necessary funding to give them that comfort.  We must also support their parents who are anxious for their children to be looked after in a dignified and reasonable way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  I thank Deputy Cregan for raising this matter and I am pleased to take this opportunity to outline the position on the funding of the Brothers of Charity services in Limerick. </P>
        <P>I would like to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the national disability strategy and its long-term goals and objectives, which we will continue to pursue in the coming years in partnership with all the stakeholders.  Government policy and best practice recognise that clients and service users need to be at the centre of service delivery.  On an ongoing basis, we are examining the way in which services are currently delivered to ensure that people with disabilities are provided with the best possible services in an efficient and appropriate manner.</P>
        <P>The Government has an ongoing commitment to provide high-quality services to all people with a disability through the national disability strategy, which has the objective of putting in place the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The national disability strategy is the framework currently being used to enact positive action measures to support the participation of people with disabilities in Irish society.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment in the areas of disability and mental health is consistent.  Overall, approximately &euro;1.6 billion is spent annually by the health services on disability programmes, including residential, day care, respite, assessments and rehabilitation services.</P>
        <P>In recent years, significant additional resources have been provided for services and supports in this area.  The multi-annual investment programme 2006-09, which is a key component of the Government&rsquo;s disability strategy, had by the end of 2008 provided for approximately 804 new residential places, 307 new respite places and 1,863 new day places for the intellectual disability service.  In addition, it had provided 275 new residential places, and 911,626 extra home care-personal assistance hours for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
        <P>Regarding the matter raised by the Deputy, I wish to inform the House that the Health Service Executive has advised the Minister for Health and Children that it is very much aware of the valuable contribution the Brothers of Charity services make to the provision of services to people with intellectual disabilities in Limerick.  The HSE is also aware of the challenges service providers, including the Brothers of Charity, are experiencing this year.</P><Col N="94"/>
        <P>The achievement of further efficiencies in disability services in 2010 requires that savings in funding to non-statutory providers, including the Brothers of Charity, are planned to ensure that there is a consistency of approach nationally, with the loss of front line services avoided as far as possible.</P>
        <P>The reduction in the 2010 cash allocation identified relates to staff pay reductions in line with national guidelines; the Government moratorium on recruitment; and a minimum of a 2% efficiency saving to be applied to non-front line services.  The latter include, for example, non-pay expenditure, transport costs, rationalising management structures, merging service functions and merging service providers, without impacting on users of front line services.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that the approach taken is compatible with, and informed by, the aims and objectives of the value for money and policy review in disability services, currently being led by the Office of Disabilities and Mental Health.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a consequence of the introduction of cost containment and efficiency measures in the 2010 budget, it is understood that the HSE advised all the agencies providing services on its behalf of their financial allocations for 2010 and the required adjustments.  The HSE plans to maintain access to appropriate treatments and services for clients during 2010 despite the current resource pressures.  The HSE is aware of the challenges which this reduction in allocations will present to organisations in ensuring that they meet the needs of service users, and in planning for emergencies that arise throughout the year.  It also recognises that maintaining service levels within available resources will require significant levels of co-operation, change, flexibility and creativity.  All disability service providers in the Limerick area have been requested to advise and discuss, with HSE management, challenges they are experiencing, prior to cuts or changes to service provision being implemented.  There are also plans to develop a local forum of all service providers &mdash; both physical and sensory, and intellectual disability &mdash; with a focus on the needs of service users now and in the future.</P>
        <P>The HSE is aware of the challenge for the Brothers of Charity to maintain existing service levels and to respond to the respite needs of service users.  While the Brothers of Charity have applied significant changes to front line services, in many cases these changes have not necessarily resulted in service reduction, but in a different model of service delivery being applied.  The HSE will continue to work in partnership with the Brothers of Charity in dealing with issues that arise from service cuts, to ensure that the needs of service users are prioritised and addressed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The history of St. Mary&rsquo;s Orthopaedic Hospital on the north side of Cork shows that in its day it provided a vision of the future.  The new buzz word in Cork in terms of health services is reconfiguration.  Everything will be moved around.  It is as if one were talking about pieces on a chessboard.  It does not matter if it is right or wrong; services will be moved.  It started with the breast clinic in the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital which was moved to the new campus in Cork University Hospital, CUH.  We are all agreed that centres of excellence are the way of the future and the unit has proven to be very successful.</P>
        <P>However, I am concerned about the proposed move of St. Mary&rsquo;s Orthopaedic Hospital in Gurranebraher.  I am surprised that Professor John Higgins has recommended the move as I have great admiration for the work he does in his specialist field, namely, gynaecology and obstetrics.  I do not understand the logic of taking an orthopaedic service from a 30 acre site which was specially designed for that purpose to put it into the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital.  Plans were unveiled last year for the merger of that hospital with the Mercy <Col N="95"/>University Hospital which involved the building of a new hospital to replace the two original hospitals because they were deemed not fit for purpose.  It is planned to take the orthopaedic service from a 30 acre site to put it into a hospital that was not considered fit for purpose as a general hospital.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, is present as he knows what I am talking about.  Orthopaedics is the heavy lifting end of surgery yet it is planned to put it into a hospital that has no parking.  If one goes to the hospital with a broken leg that will be the least of one&rsquo;s troubles.  One will leave the hospital either in a wheelchair or on crutches but one&rsquo;s car will be parked half a mile down the road because there is no parking outside the hospital.  The parking in the hospital is for staff only yet it is planned to incorporate an orthopaedic service into a hospital that has outdated lifts and no ground floor service.  That is what is proposed although orthopaedic patients more than likely will not be able to walk on their own.</P>
        <P>The orthopaedic hospital is on a 30 acre site.  We were promised that a new rehabilitation service to serve the entire south of the country would be built there but that will not happen now.  The Health Service Executive is in discussion with the local authority and other interested parties about turning the site into a commercial area.  This move is more about making it convenient for doctors than providing a better service for patients which worries me very much.</P>
        <P>When the North Infirmary closed 22 years ago the last general hospital on the north side of Cork was removed.  If the orthopaedic hospital goes then that will be the last vestige of inpatient service available on the north side of Cork.  When Professor John Higgins first spoke about reconfiguration &mdash; I have no doubt he is well intentioned &mdash; he told us that no hospital would close as a result of reconfiguration.  I do not know what one would call a unit that does not have beds but it is not a hospital.  He might talk about primary care and other issues but St. Mary&rsquo;s will not be a hospital and orthopaedics will not fit well into the campus where he intends to put it.</P>
        <P>There is one aspect of health services in St. Mary&rsquo;s Orthopaedic Hospital that he should reconfigure, namely, Grove House, which houses people with severe intellectual disabilities.  I am told by the HSE that no money is available for that move and that the service will remain on the site.  It is a case of people being put in the most inappropriate place one could possibly imagine for their condition yet no move is proposed for them.  This is about selling the site and getting money for HSE south.  It is not about providing a better service.  The people of Cork had every faith in the service, which had the only public orthopaedic outpatients&rsquo; clinic in the country.  That worked extraordinarily well but it is going to be moved because it is located on a valuable 30 acre site on the north side of Cork.  A total of 220 jobs will be taken out of the area, one which desperately needs the type of investment which those jobs provided.  However, that does not matter to the HSE.  It should matter to the Minister of State how the service is provided and how areas will manage without it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Kathleen Lynch for raising this matter.  I assure her that reconfiguration is also a buzzword in Wexford and the south east.  I will be taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, Minister for Health and Children.  The Government is committed to ensuring delivery of the best quality health services possible, in an effective and efficient way.  We are all familiar with the expert advice that, for the delivery of complex care, outcomes for patients are better if the care takes places where the necessary staff and equipment are to hand and, crucially, where there is a sufficient volume of activity.  The success of this approach has already been demonstrated through the national cancer service, based on the principles of patient safety and quality.  The expert opinion is that the adoption of this approach throughout the acute hospital system will lead to improved services.</P><Col N="96"/>
        <P>The HSE south&rsquo;s business plan for 2010 prioritises the reconfiguration of its acute hospital services.  Undoubtedly, this will produce significant changes in the way health services are delivered and organised in the region.  Principal to this new delivery is the plan to create a single acute hospital system across the region to achieve the best possible health outcomes for the people of Cork and Kerry.  As part of this process, the HSE will be relocating some services between the six acute hospitals.  Earlier this month, HSE south announced its intention to relocate orthopaedic services, including elective inpatient, rehabilitation trauma and day surgery, from St. Mary&rsquo;s Orthopaedic Hospital to the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital.  The objective in relocating orthopaedic services to an acute hospital setting, with related specialties on-site including rheumatology and anaesthetics, is a much enhanced service.</P>
        <P>The relocation of orthopaedic services to an acute setting is the first element of the reconfiguration programme.  Patients from Cork, Kerry and the wider Munster area will benefit from improved treatment and surgery for conditions including spinal and skeletal injuries and deformities, in addition to rehabilitation for damaged joints and muscles.  The redeveloped facility will have three dedicated orthopaedic theatres, compared to the two in St. Mary&rsquo;s.  It is also intended, following the move, to recommence orthopaedic surgery for children, for which HSE south patients must currently attend Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, in Dublin.  Patient accommodation will also be upgraded.  The HSE remains fully committed to the future use of the St. Mary&rsquo;s site as a health complex.  It intends to maintain existing services on campus, including mental health, intellectual disability, ambulance, outreach, maternity and health centre services.  The newly built 50-bed community nursing unit is due to open this year.  The outpatient facility site will also be retained and a range of consultant and nurse-led outpatient services will be delivered.</P>
        <P>HSE south has had discussions with Cork City Council and is working with other partners on the future use of the site for additional health facilities, such as a major primary care centre.  A key purpose of this engagement is to ensure that adequate provision is made to meet the future health service requirements of the population of this area.  This will be undertaken as part of the city council&rsquo;s review of the master plan for the area.  The move of orthopaedic services into an acute hospital setting, as part of a coherent and structured reorganisation of the delivery of acute services in the HSE south area, supported by best international practice, is a progressive and innovative initiative.  The result will be better outcomes and health services for the people of the region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an urgent need for the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Health and Children to take immediate action to ensure the delivery of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme which faces further severe delays this year, causing hardship to low income families with school-going children.  I have raised this matter on the Adjournment to try to instil a sense of urgency on the part of the Government.  If action is not taken soon, we will face a worse situation than we saw last year, when applicants encountered long delays and payments were not received until well after the start of the school year.  In my own constituency and across the State, people who have sought application forms for the scheme have been told they are not yet available.  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme helps families on social welfare and HSE payments to meet the cost of uniforms and footwear for children who attend school.  Many families depend on the scheme to ensure their children can avail of education.  As unemployment increases, the number of people qualifying for the scheme is growing.</P>
        <P>The scheme is supposed to operate from 1 June to 31 September each year.  I am sure the Minister of State is wondering why I am raising this issue when we have not yet reached the <Col N="97"/>turn of the month.  Last year, forms were not available until the middle of June and many people did not receive payments until well into September.  I understand that even worse delays are likely to take place this year.  There are inadequate staffing levels to cope with the number of applicants.  These delays cause real hardship.  In many cases, school uniforms come into the shops in June.  Parents need to budget to pay for uniforms, school books and other onerous school expenses.  They wish to spread their spending over the summer months.  Delays to this scheme will lead to delays in the making of payments to which people are entitled, perhaps until late September or beyond.</P>
        <P>I have mentioned the Ministers for Social Protection and Health and Children because this payment is part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is funded by the Department of Social Protection and administered by the HSE.  The two Departments and the HSE need to get their act together now.  We do not want a repeat of 2009.  By August of that year, more than 50,000 parents who had applied under the scheme had experienced delays in the processing of claims.  The HSE admitted that a backlog resulted in less than one third of applications being processed at that stage.  At least another 130,000 applications were expected before September.  The HSE had received almost 80,000 applications by the middle of July of last year, but it had processed just 25,332 of them by 10 July.  This must not be repeated.  That is why I am raising the issue now.</P>
        <P>The already overworked community welfare officers need additional assistance.  The recruitment embargo should be lifted, extra staff should be hired even on a temporary basis and staff should be redeployed where appropriate.  The bottom line is that people should not be forced to suffer further delays and hardship.  The Government has already reduced social welfare payments.  It has abolished the Christmas bonus completely.  It has cut educational supports.  Low-income families with children, which are already finding it difficult to make ends meet on a daily basis, must not be targeted again.  I strongly urge that the lessons of last year and other years be learned.  We should not see a repetition in 2010 of what happened in those years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  It is timely and most appropriate for him to do so at this stage.  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme provides a one off payment to eligible families to help them to meet the extra costs that arise when children start school each autumn.  The allowance is not intended to cover the cost of sending children to school.  As the name suggests, it is intended to assist with clothing and footwear expenses.  A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if he or she is in receipt of a social welfare payment, including family income supplement, or a HSE payment; if he or she is participating in an approved employment scheme; or if he or she is attending a recognised education and training course and has a household income at or below certain set levels.  The purpose of the household income limit is to ensure the allowance is directed at those with the greatest need.  For the 2010 scheme, the income thresholds for entitlement to back to school clothing and footwear allowance have been increased.  The income limit for the allowance for parents with one child is now &euro;564 for couples and &euro;411 for one-parent families.  The income limit increases by &euro;29.80 for each additional qualified child.  The rates of payment for back to school clothing and footwear allowance have been increased significantly in recent years.  Since 2005, the allowance has increased from &euro;80 to &euro;200 in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years, and from &euro;150 to &euro;305 for those from 12 to 22 years.  These are increases of 150% and 103%, respectively.  In addition, an extra allowance of &euro;215 is payable in respect of 18 year olds for whom compensatory child benefit is in payment.  The total payment in respect of 18 year olds in this category is &euro;520.  The number of children benefiting from the allowance increased from 180,000 in 2007 to over 275,000 in 2009.  The number of families benefiting in this period increased from 88,000 to 139,000.  Current indications are that approximately 160,000 families, with more than 310,000 children, will benefit from the scheme in 2010, at a cost of over &euro;82 million.</P><Col N="98"/>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the HSE.  Up to 105 temporary posts for a period of six months were sanctioned by the Department of Finance on 13 May 2010 for the administration of the scheme in 2010.  The HSE has advised that the recruitment of these workers has commenced.  In order to assist with the administrative efficiency of the scheme, the Department will give the HSE details of clients who were paid the allowance in 2009 and were in receipt of a departmental payment at May 2010.  The purpose of this approach is to give the HSE the most up-to-date information that will allow it to issue an application form to the individual households that are most likely to qualify for the scheme in 2010.  The HSE has advised that these application forms will be issued by the middle of June and that households will be advised of all details relevant to the processing of their applications.  The HSE has indicated that in general, the payment of the allowance should issue six weeks from date of receipt of the application.  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is considered to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain.  The improvements to the scheme in recent years provide a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with the return to school for those who most need assistance.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to raise the staffing problems that are currently mitigating against the three private agricultural colleges, as opposed to the State-run Teagasc colleges.  I am speaking about this issue in the context of the moratorium on public service recruitment.  The college I know best, which is in Mountbellew, County Galway, has 120 applicants this year, as it did last year.  During the successful years of the Celtic tiger economy, when increased numbers of jobs were available outside the farm, most agricultural colleges had reduced numbers of applicants.  The huge impetus that exists in the sector at the moment will be lost, unfortunately, if something is not done about staffing levels.  I assume the other two private colleges, like Mountbellew, are unable to fill positions that are vacant because of teacher retirements.  The quota of teachers that exists at present means that the college in Mountbellew will be able to accept just 50 of the 120 applicants this year.  When one considers that it is the only agricultural college in the west of Ireland, and that the vast majority of the 120 applicants are from the western area, one can take it that this problem is causing huge problems for everybody concerned.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In the few minutes I have at my disposal, I want to thank the board of Teagasc.  Our college was on death row but, through the good offices of the director of Teagasc, Dr. Gerry Boyle, and the board of directors, it was given another two years.  I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, is here to speak about this matter because he has a direct interest in it.  I am sure it is clear to him that if the embargo on replacing retiring teaching staff is continued, in a couple of years time the college will close anyway, irrespective of what will happen in two or three years time.  However, the matter is much more complicated than that.  It would seem daft to many people on the outside.  As the Minister of State knows, the problem is that the salaries of the teachers in the private colleges are recouped because Teagasc is paying them.  The ridiculous situation now exists that when a teacher retires in one of the State-run colleges, such as Ballyhaise or Kildalton, there is no ban on a replacement being recruited.  However, in Mountbellew, Pallaskenry and Gurteen colleges, which are privately owned, retiring teachers cannot be replaced.  If this continues, these colleges will be strangled.</P>
        <P>I, like every other Member, understand the public sector recruitment ban was introduced to save money.  In the cases in question it saves nothing, however.  The same teachers in the private colleges are being paid by Teagasc anyway.  It is against this background that I want the Minister <Col N="99"/>for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Minister for Finance to examine the colleges in question because they are in great danger of being forced to close without anyone talking about doing so officially.</P>
        <P>I have not spoken about this matter with the staff at the colleges.  I am raising it because I will fight any day to ensure the west has an agricultural college of its own.  There are different farming practices and patterns in the west and not to have its own agricultural college teaching these would be disastrous for its farming community.  If this recruitment embargo is allowed to continue, the west will not have a college very soon.</P>

	<P>It is a matter for Teagasc to allocate financial and staff resources in accordance with its priorities and in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy.  Ministerial responsibility is confined to matters of policy in accordance with the Act establishing Teagasc and is not concerned with its day-to-day operations.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has an important role to play in supporting the Government&rsquo;s strategy for the development of the agriculture and food industries through the provision of research, advisory and education services to farmers and the rural economy.  It is the main provider of further education for school leavers in agriculture, horticulture, forestry and equine studies.  Teagasc&rsquo;s education programme contributes to improving the competitiveness of agriculture, food and the wider bio-economy; supporting sustainable farming and the environment; encouraging diversification of the rural economy and enhancing the quality of life in rural areas; and enhancing organisational capability and delivering value for money.</P>
        <P>Changing market requirements highlight more than ever the need for a highly educated and skilled agricultural workforce.  Great strides have been made in agricultural education in recent years.  Teagasc has been to the fore in progressing the agricultural education agenda, earning a well-deserved reputation for delivering high-quality and relevant programmes for people with aspirations of a career in agriculture or those seeking employment in ancillary industries and services.  These programmes are delivered through a network of eight colleges, 80 local Teagasc centres and the Teagasc e-college.</P>
        <P>The numbers of students attending these courses has increased each year for the past three years.  Last year, for example, some 1,500 new students enrolled bringing the total numbers participating in Teagasc courses to 3,200.  This augurs well for the future of the agrifood sector.  All of Teagasc&rsquo;s education and training programmes are fully accredited by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland.  The accreditation of programmes continues to raise the standing of Teagasc qualifications both nationally and internationally.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has been seeking to rationalise resources devoted to agricultural education to reduce costs and deliver a more efficient service.  In 2007, it commissioned an outside consultancy body to develop the most appropriate model for the delivery of education services.  The review identified the need for critical mass within the college network of staff, students and facilities and recommended development of a new education structure around three lead colleges owned by Teagasc at Ballyhaise, Kildalton and Kinsealy, supported by 12 regional education centres to complement the activities of the lead colleges.  This new model for agricultural education is being implemented.</P>
        <P>This review of education services is part of the ongoing process of change in the Teagasc organisation.  In March 2009, the Teagasc authority approved a major change programme to re-organise and refocus the organisation to meet the significant challenges that lie ahead.  The planned programme has a medium-term implementation timeframe and provides for rationalisation measures across the organisation including the advisory office and educational networks, <Col N="100"/>disposal of land resources and prioritisation of programme activities.  The agreed actions are currently being implemented.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the development and implementation of the Teagasc agricultural education programme is an operational matter for Teagasc management.  It has over 180 teaching staff employed in the Teagasc-owned agricultural colleges and subvents the salaries of a further 45 teaching staff who deliver education programmes for Teagasc at the three privately owned agricultural colleges at Gurteen, Pallaskenry and Mountbellew.  The private colleges account for one third of all college enrolments in 2009-2010 and Teagasc provides funding to the colleges under several headings including pay and pension costs, capitation grants and student maintenance grants.</P>
        <P>As with all public service organisations, the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service announced by the Government in March 2009 to reduce public service numbers and correct imbalances in the public finances applies equally to posts in Teagasc to the end of 2010.  It is the responsibility of Teagasc management to work within the terms of the moratorium and match demand for education programmes with available staff resources.  Re-allocation of work and redeployment of staff will be an essential part of this process.</P>
        <P>Following on from the moratorium, it has been agreed by the Government that employment control frameworks will be put in place across the public service to achieve targeted reductions in overall staff numbers.  An employment control framework for Teagasc is being finalised with my Department and the Department of Finance.  It is envisaged that it will provide for limited recruitment on an exceptional basis subject to compliance with annual ceilings for staff numbers.</P>
        <P>I fully appreciate Teagasc&rsquo;s contribution to agricultural education.  I am satisfied that Teagasc, with the ongoing support of my Department, is well positioned to deliver the education and training programmes necessary for the sustainable development of the agrifood sector.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 44 together.</P>
        <P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  The role of money advisors is to help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors.   MABS is now dealing with increasingly complex debt situations in respect of clients who are presenting with multiple creditors/debts.</P>
        <P>In 2005, MABS dealt with approximately 10,900 new clients.  In 2006 the number was similar with 11,000 new clients seen by the service.  This figure increased to 12,000 and 16,000 in 2007 and 2008 respectively.  The number increased further to 19,000 in 2009.  In the period January to April 2010 a total of 7,300 new clients have been seen by MABS which would indicate that the number of clients is broadly in line with the figures for 2009.  In addition the MABS helpline has dealt some 47,500 calls since its launch in October 2007.  Some 10,000 calls have been dealt with to date this year, compared with 24,000 callers in 2009.</P>
        <P>From first point of contact to first appointment with a money advisor the average waiting time is currently just over 4 weeks.  This is the average nationally and there are fluctuations <Col N="102"/>between offices.  During the waiting period, clients are assessed and those in need of immediate assistance are given a priority appointment, others are provided with assisted self-help to ensure that they have taken steps to assess their situation and if appropriate they are supported to take holding action with their creditors.  I am satisfied that the additional resources provided to MABS will assist them to meet the demand for their services.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>  the balance of the social insurance fund for each of the past ten years; the projected balance for the next three years; the expected deficit for 2010; the details on the way this deficit will be met; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Social Insurance Fund comprises a current account and an investment account.  To the extent that annual income is not required for benefit payments, this finance, together with the accumulated surplus from previous years is transferred to the investment account.  Annual surpluses were a feature of the fund between 1996 and 2007. The highest annual surplus was realised in 2006.  The accumulated surplus was &euro;420m in 1999, it peaked in 2007 when the balance in the fund reached &euro;3,632 million and subsequently fell to &euro;934m by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>In 2010 the Fund will exhaust the cash balance held in the investment account.  The operating deficit of the Fund at the end of 2010 is estimated to be &euro;1.55 billion.  This deficit will be borne by the Exchequer by means of a subvention from the Oireachtas &mdash; Vote 38.  The authorisation of the House was given on 29th April to permit funding to be drawn down for use in the Social Insurance Fund.  It is forecast that the Social Insurance Fund expenditure will exceed its income in each of the years 2011 to 2013, with the deficit continuing to be borne by means of a subvention from the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>The Social Insurance Fund will continue to hold a capital asset over this period represented in the form of Department&rsquo;s headquarters property in Store Street, Dublin. A table outlining the income, expenditure, annual surplus or deficit and balances over the ten year period will be made available to the Deputies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>All recipients of the one-parent family payment are asked to complete, an annual review form (OFP 40) to certify that they continue to fulfil the conditions for payment.  The form is generated automatically and the customer is allowed two weeks to return it to the Department.  If the form is not returned or not returned in time, the payment is automatically suspended by the computer system.  On 13 May local offices of the Department began to receive enquiries from some OFP customers who stated that their payment was not in the post office when they called to collect it.</P>
        <P>Following an investigation in the computer operations area of the Department it transpired that due to an oversight, a batch of approximately 400 OFP 40 forms had not been processed and the usual controls for monitoring this work had failed on this occasion. When the Regional Director&rsquo;s Office of the Department was alerted to the problem, they instructed local offices to reinstate payment to any customer who enquired about the non payment.</P>
        <P>At this stage payment has been restored to the majority of customers affected.  However, in approximately 30 cases where payment was stopped, we have received no contact from the customer about their payment. I have arranged for the Department to contact these customers to establish whether they continue to fulfil the conditions for entitlement to the one parent family payment and in such cases to make appropriate arrangements to restore payment without further delay.  I very much regret the inconvenience caused to customers by the failure to issue the forms and I can assure the Deputy that the Department is reviewing its procedures for issuing such forms.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 69 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that there were 26,000 appeals received in 2009 and it is estimated the number in 2010 could reach 30,000 compared to the average number received over the previous 4 years of 15,000.  This represents a near 50% increase in the number of appeals received.  At the end of 2009 there were 16,000 appeals on hands and <Col N="104"/>that figure has now risen to 19,000 whereas in previous years that number would have been in the region of 5,000 to 6,000.  I understand that during 2009 the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 24 weeks.  However, if allowance was made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to 15.8 weeks.  This represents an increase of 2 weeks in the time taken to process appeals when compared to 2008.</P>
        <P>While the growing number of appeals is clearly impacting on processing times it must also be remembered that the processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examination by the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors in certain illness related cases,  further investigation by Social Welfare Inspectors where required and circumstances may also arise where further information is sought from the appellant. Delays can also occur where the appellant submits new information or evidence, often at an advanced stage in the proceedings.  In some cases adjournments may be sought by the appellants or their representatives.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives are currently underway designed to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A number of additional staff are being assigned to administration area of the Office,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The organisation of the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s work has been changed so as to increase productivity,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A project to improve the business processes in the office is underway and a number of improvements have already been implemented,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Significant enhancements are being made to the Office&rsquo;s IT and phone systems.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Notwithstanding these measures, it is clear that further additional staff will be required in the short term to address the backlog that has developed. Any such staff must be very experienced and be in a position to operate without significant training. Therefore it has been decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources to clear the backlog of appeals.</P>

	<P>Facilitators work closely with F&Aacute;S and other agencies, at national and local level, to identify appropriate training and developmental programmes for social welfare recipients of working age to enhance the skills those individuals have and, ultimately, improve their employment chances as well as helping them to develop personally.  The facilitator service is available to social welfare recipients at all local offices where facilitators hold open clinics and meet with people who have been referred either by the social welfare local office or by other agencies.  Arrangements to see the facilitator can be made by contacting the social welfare local office or the facilitator directly.  In addition, cases are selected and referred to facilitators by Employment Support section.</P><Col N="105"/>
        <P>There are currently 62.5 facilitators in place (a full time equivalent of 61 posts). It is proposed to increase this to 70 posts. However further appointments are subject to the current moratorium on recruitment and promotions and will be filled by redeployment of staff within the Department and from across the Civil Service.  In the current economic climate the demand for the facilitator service is elevated. Facilitators generally have scheduled days when they are available in different locations across our network of offices and people wishing to meet with a Facilitator would be advised to call on one of those days &mdash; a centralised appointment system is not maintained.  Accordingly waiting times for individual facilitators are not maintained.  Facilitators make every effort to contact all interested customers as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>The Department has developed, in conjunction with a number of other Government Departments, the specifications for a Public Service Card (PSC) under the Standard Authentication Framework Environment, or SAFE, programme.  The specification provides for identification features, including a photograph.  The aim is to develop a card that acts as a key for access to public services in general, identifying and authenticating individuals as appropriate and where required.  Legislative provisions in relation to the introduction of the Public Service Card have been included in Section 263 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended by Section 32 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007).</P>
        <P>These specify that the Minister may issue a Public Service Card in the format that he or she deems fit with the person&rsquo;s name, personal public service number, photograph, signature, card issue number and card expiry date to be inscribed on the card.  Provision is also included for the person&rsquo;s name, personal public service number, date of birth, sex, all former surnames (if any) of the person&rsquo;s mother, photograph, signature and card expiry date to be electronically encoded on the card.  In addition, provision is made for any other information that may be prescribed to be either inscribed or electronically encoded on the card.</P>
        <P>Over the past few years significant progress has been made on the implementation of the project including the selection of a preferred bidder to provide a managed service for card production and related bureau services. Technical specifications were finalised and the necessary organisational change was designed.  However, in view of the prevailing economic climate the project was suspended until formal sanction to proceed was received from the Department of Finance at the end of last year. A contract was agreed with the managed service provider from early January.</P>
        <P>The remaining elements of the production project are expected to take several months to complete. Significant preparatory work has to be undertaken including decisions regarding the final design of the card and to develop a secure site for the personalisation of the cards. It will also be necessary to develop a technical infrastructure within the Department to support the management and administration of the cards.  Procurement for this development has commenced.  The overall time for completion of initial deployment of a Public Services Card is dependent on the rate at which it will be possible to register all of those to whom it will be issued.</P><Col N="106"/>
        <P>Features such as photographs and signatures and electronic card authentication are expected to minimise the rate of fraud and error arising from incorrectly identified and authenticated individuals.  The Public Service Card will replace cards currently in use, such as the Social Services Card and the Free Travel card with highly secure cards. Other Departments and agencies will also be in a position to use the card.  A further benefit of the Public Service Card will be the efficiencies that can be achieved by all agencies using the card.  The time spent on establishing identity and authentication will be reduced leading to significant potential savings across the whole public sector.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 60 and 67 together.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the State.</P>
        <P>Similarly the purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is to provide short term support to people who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayments due to changes in their employment circumstances and whose means are now inadequate to meet their basic day to day needs.  The aim of the scheme, working within the overall social welfare framework, is to ensure that people do not suffer unnecessary hardship due to loss of employment and that in the short term they can maintain their sole place of residence whilst being unemployed.  Mortgage interest supplement only covers the mortgage interest payments in respect of an eligible person&rsquo;s sole place of residence. It is a means tested payment and other qualifying criteria apply.</P>
        <P>Information in relation to the number of recipients of rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement is shown in the attached tabular statement. Over 37,800 rent supplement recipients have been in payment for 18 months or more. There are currently over 16,500 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement with expenditure on this scheme expected to be in the region of &euro;64 million in 2010.</P>
        <P>Mortgage interest supplement claim details should be electronically recorded where entitlement to mortgage interest supplement is refused.  However, as the practice can vary from community welfare area to area, statistics for the number of people who applied for and were refused mortgage interest supplement without an appeal, are not available. This failure to <Col N="107"/>maintain accurate records should be viewed in the context of the increased demands being placed on community welfare officers in the current economic environment.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>  his plans for carers following the decision not to publish the national carers strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[21695/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>During 2008, an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process, to develop a National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.  However, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time limits which could be achieved.  In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy.  This position remains unchanged.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers.  It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for carers.  Over the past decade, carer payment rates have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit, half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  People caring for more than one person receive a higher rate of payment, equating to an additional 50% of the maximum personal rate.  Recipients with children also receive a qualified child increase in respect of each child.</P>
        <P>Following this year&rsquo;s Budget, the carer&rsquo;s allowance rate for carers over 66 years of age has not changed and remains at &euro;239.  The rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance for someone under 66 is &euro;212.  Since the introduction of the carer&rsquo;s allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively. As a result, even with the reduction announced in the last Budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carer&rsquo;s allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.</P>
        <P>The means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.    A couple with an income in the region of <Col N="108"/>&euro;60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package.  These levels surpass the &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo; commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to &euro;1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.  The Government will continue to support carers within the resources available.</P>

	<P>The Department&rsquo;s facilitators work with social welfare recipients of working age, including people in receipt of jobseekers payments, people parenting alone, people in receipt of disability welfare payments and people providing care, to promote participation and social inclusion.  Facilitators help people to identify appropriate training or development programmes which will enhance the skills that the individual has and ultimately improve their employment chances, as well as help them to continue to develop personally.  Facilitators develop individual progression plans with the customer.  They are located throughout the country and are assigned to cover defined geographical areas. They work closely with F&Aacute;S and other agencies at a local level to identify and target appropriate education, training and development opportunities.</P>
        <P>In the current economic climate the demand for the facilitator service is elevated.  Facilitators make every effort to contact customers as quickly as possible. The facilitator service was enhanced under the National Development Plan (NDP) Social and Economic Participation Programme.  Twenty four additional facilitators have been appointed since September, 2008.  There are 62.5 currently serving (full time equivalent 61 posts). It is intended to increase the number to 70 posts.  Clerical support for facilitators is provided centrally by Employment Support Services section.  The number of facilitators in place, their workload, and the effectiveness of the service will continue to be monitored.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 72, 77, 80 and 81 together.</P>
        <P>The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department.  A key objective of the Department&rsquo;s control strategy is to ensure that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time.  A four-pronged control strategy has been adopted by the Department, namely prevention of fraud and error at the initial claim stage, early detection through effective review of claims in payment, measures to deter fraud, and the pursuit and recovery of overpayments.</P>
        <P>In relation to accessing information for fraud and error detection, the Department is involved in a number of data matching initiatives which are effective in identifying high risk claims for review and ensuring that review activity is targeted in the most effective manner.  Data exchange is provided for by legislation and is an example of good cross-departmental co-operation.  Every month commencement of employment data from the Revenue Commissioners are matched against the Department&rsquo;s schemes and investigations are conducted where warranted.  All matches identified are examined to determine whether there has been wilful concealment of information by the customer.  Where there has been concurrent working and claiming for 12 weeks or more or where the overpayment exceeds &euro;2,000 such cases will be considered for prosecution.</P>
        <P>In addition the following organisations provide information to the Department for the purpose of the data matching:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Irish Prison Service provides lists of prison inmates on a quarterly basis.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal provides data on compensation payments made.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Courts Service has provided on-line access for information on the probate index of issued grants.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Third level institutions supply details of students registered for full-time daytime education.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Access to the General Register&rsquo;s Office regarding births, deaths and marriages is proving very effective for control purposes.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Private Security Authority provided information on security licence holders.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Data have also been received from the Department of Agriculture &amp; Food on total grant payments issued to farmers.</P><Col N="110"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Commission for Taxi Regulation has supplied data on active taxi/ hackney licence holders.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Private Rental Tenancies Board provides information on registered landlords.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Department continues to explore the value of possible new data matches.  However reporting on these at this stage could prejudice the value of these sources.</P>
        <P>Control savings are calculated by applying validated multipliers to the difference in the rate of payment before and after the control activity.  Multipliers used in assessing control savings estimate the potential future savings to the Department of a revocation or reduction resulting from a control action.  The multiplier used is based on an estimated duration that a person would have remained on benefit in the absence of the control activity, and this varies by scheme.  The Department&rsquo;s Control Division carries out validation exercises to ensure control savings are recorded correctly in accordance with the guidelines.  The methodology is kept under review.  I understand that a review to be carried out in consultation with C&amp;AG will commence shortly.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that control savings provide valid, useful and comparable measures of progress towards achieving results.  The rapidly changing economic environment with large increases in the levels of unemployed poses challenges for the prevention and effective management of fraud and control.  The Department&rsquo;s response to these challenges has been to introduce new measures, which are evidence based, to target control activity at high risk categories of claimants.  A target of &euro;533.3 million was set for control savings in 2010.  The current work to rule measures in the Department have impacted on the reporting of the value of control activities so it is not possible to say if control savings are on target.  However, I am hopeful that the target will be met.</P>
        <P>Regarding rent supplements a review of maximum rent supplement levels is expected to be completed shortly.  This review, in conjunction with the decline in rental market rates generally, will ensure that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country, and that they will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 76 together.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection already assists low income households with heating costs through their basic payments, through the fuel allowance scheme and through the household benefits package of electricity and gas allowances. These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.  The fuel allowance is paid for 32 weeks each year from end <Col N="111"/>September to end April. In the 2009/2010 heating season over 340,000 recipients benefited from the allowance at a cost of over &euro;231million.</P>
        <P>Some 376,000 pensioners are receiving the household benefits which provides 2,400 electricity units per annum (or the gas equivalent) over the year and it is estimated that some 140,000 of these households are receiving both fuel allowance and the electricity units /gas allowance under the household benefits to assist with the heating and other energy requirements. The household benefit package cost &euro;184million in 2009.</P>
        <P>Proper household insulation is absolutely vital in tacking fuel poverty. Initiatives such as the Warmer Homes Scheme, operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have a very valuable role to play in that regard, as does funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to improve the quality of existing local authority housing and the Housing Adaptation Grants for older people and people with disabilities. Considerable progress has been made in this area in recent years.  In his Carbon Budget Statement, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, outlined details of &euro;130 million in funding for insulation, &euro;76 million of which will be used to assist low income families.</P>
        <P>The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio and has convened an Inter-Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy to coordinate and drive Government policy in this area.  The Inter Departmental/Agency Group has been asked to draw up an Energy Affordability Strategy.  This strategy will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability and will have regard both to the impact of the carbon tax on low income households and the range of supports outlined above in making its recommendations.  As part of its work, the Group will make recommendations as to the precise package of measures, including in the area of income support, that should be put in place to assist those at risk of fuel poverty.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 58 and 73 together.</P>
        <P>The Government discussion paper, &ldquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents&rdquo;, was published in 2006 and can be viewed at:</P>
<P FLI="0" el="0">http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Policy/PolicyPublications/Families/Documents/prop_lp.pdf. It put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents, the focused provision of childcare, improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low-income families with young children.</P>
        <P>The One-Parent Family Payment, by its nature, is not payable where the lone parent is co-habiting with the other parent of the child or with someone else as husband and wife.  The <Col N="112"/>discussion paper proposed that the category of lone parenthood would be abolished.  Instead, a parental allowance would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner) with young children on a low income, thus ending the co-habitation rule.  It will not be possible for my Department to progress this aspect of the proposal due, in part, to current economic climate.  These proposals have, however, informed deliberations regarding the One-Parent Family Payment scheme.</P>
        <P>The current duration of the One-Parent Family Payment, which is payable until the youngest child reaches the age of 18 &mdash; or 22 if in full-time education &mdash; is not in the best interests of the recipient, their children or society.  Social welfare supports for lone parents should be designed to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />prevent long-term dependence on welfare and facilitate financial independence;</P>                                               <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />recognise parental choice with regard to care of young children but with the expectation that parents will not remain outside of the labour force indefinitely, and</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />include an expectation of participation in education, training and employment, with supports provided in this regard.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">To meet these social policy objectives, my Department will be introducing changes to the One-Parent Family Payment in the forthcoming Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2010.  For new customers, from April 2011, it is proposed that the One-Parent Family Payment will be paid until the youngest child in the family reaches the age of 13 years.  For existing recipients of the payment, there will be a phasing-out period to enable them to access education and training and to prepare them for their return to the labour market.</P>
        <P>These changes will bring Ireland&rsquo;s support for lone parents more in line with international provisions, where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.  The EU countries that are achieving the best outcomes in terms of tackling child poverty are those that are combining strategies aimed at facilitating access to employment and enabling services (e.g. child care) with income support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The money advisers throughout the country focus on providing assistance, advice and intense support to people who have financial difficulties.  The money adviser works out a budget and negotiates on behalf of the client with all creditors, including financial institutions and sub-prime lenders, to secure better terms for the client in managing the repayment of their debts.  Where required by the client, the money adviser can assist with setting up a special account with a local Credit Union into which an agreed amount of money is lodged regularly and from which each month the money adviser makes the repayments to the creditors on behalf of the client.  In 2009 some 2,618 special accounts were set up with the local Credit Unions.</P>
        <P>Focused training programmes designed to equip money advice staff and local management boards to meet the demands on the services are provided by MABS NDL, the national support company.  In addition, MABS NDL has introduced a number of community education and other initiatives to assist the services in managing their increased caseloads.  These include a money management education programme for people facing redundancy to inform them about managing on a reduced income and how to avoid getting into debt.</P>
        <P>Under the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears published by the Financial Regulator, all financial institutions including the banks and sub-prime mortgage lenders must, where circumstances warrant it, refer a borrower in difficulty for guidance to a local MABS office or to an appropriate alternative.  An operational protocol &lsquo;<i>Working Together to Manage Debt&rsquo;</i> is in place and is the result of almost 2 years work by MABS NDL and the Irish Banking Federation (IBF), the main representative body for the banking and financial services sector.  The protocol applies to all client debts, including mortgage debt, owed to the major lending institutions in Ireland and includes a commitment that no legal action will be taken as long as there is compliance by the client with an agreed repayment plan.</P>
        <P>Last year an additional 19 money advisers were appointed to MABS companies throughout the country.  They have been fully trained in the application of money advice work and the relevant codes and legislation relating to mortgage debt.  I am satisfied that MABS provides a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.  I am confident that the money advisors are trained and equipped to deliver this important service to the members of the public who require it.</P>

There is a range of issues to be considered in relation to the scope and implementation of any proposed amendment on this matter. Some of these issues have cross-departmental implications and these need to be considered also.</P>
        <P>The general review of the provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The review will include the provisions relating to the registration of deaths. As the Deputy is aware, there is a number of steps to be taken before any legislation might come before the Oireachtas and it is not possible to be definite as to timescales at this juncture.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 64 and 68 together.</P>
        <P>There are currently just over 16,500 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, compared to 8,091 recipients in 2008. Expenditure for the year ending December 2009 was &euro;60.7m; the estimate for 2010 is &euro;63.9m.  The mortgage interest supplement scheme is currently under review. The main purpose of this review is to examine how the scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis. The review group includes representatives from my Department, the Community Welfare Service, the Departments of Finance and Environment, Heritage and Local Government, together with a representative from the Office of the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>As part of the initial review, guidelines on specific and immediate operational issues were drawn up and circulated to the community welfare officers. These guidelines are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.welfare.ie  The group is examining trends in programme and administrative costs, the impact of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s statutory Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears and legislative and operational issues arising, including the cap on hours of employment.  The review is also considering whether alternative approaches to achieving the scheme&rsquo;s objectives are warranted in the light of recent changes in the economic climate and the mortgage market.</P>
        <P>More recently, the Government has established a broader and more comprehensive review of mortgage arrears and personal debt. The Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney, comprises representatives from my own Department, the Departments of Finance, Taoiseach, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  In addition the Group has representatives from the Office of the Financial <Col N="115"/>Regulator, the ESRI, the Irish Banking Federation, the Free Legal Advice Centre and the Law Reform Commission.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference for the Group are based on the Renewed Programme for Government, with an emphasis on protecting the family home. They include a review of the statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the recently agreed protocol between the Irish Bankers Federation and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service on debt default, with a view to expanding the options available for dealing with debt situations to avoid foreclosure. In addition, the Group is examining measures adopted in other jurisdictions and considering ways of expanding existing mortgage-support measures. I understand that the Group will make its report to the Minister for Finance by the end of June.  The conclusions and recommendations from the review of the mortgage interest supplement scheme, which is currently being finalised, will inform the work of this group.</P>

	<P>The Government is conscious that many lone parents will need access to education, training and enabling services such as childcare provision in order to acquire the skills they will need to gain employment.  As outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 400 of 18 May, 2010, there are a wide range of education and training opportunities available through my Department, the Department of Education and Science and F&Aacute;S for lone parents to strengthen their qualifications and skills base and thus maximise their chances of meeting the requirements of the modern labour market and gaining employment.</P>
        <P>Good progress has been made in relation to the provision of childcare. Government invested some &euro;1 billion throughout the last decade, Early Childhood Care and Education year for pre-school children was recently introduced and the revised Community Childcare Subvention Scheme will be introduced in September, 2010, with a supplementary focus on labour activation.  Accordingly, I will be progressing with the proposed changes to the One-Parent Family Payment in the forthcoming Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2010.</P>

	<P>The recently published National Pensions Framework is the Government&rsquo;s plan for pension reform. It encompasses all aspects of pensions, including social welfare pensions, private occupational pensions and public sector pension reform. Development of the framework was informed by the range of views raised during the comprehensive consultation process which followed publication of the Green Paper on Pensions. The aim of the framework is to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State. It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly <Col N="116"/>among low to middle income groups and to ensure that State support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.</P>
        <P>A technical implementation group has been established to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the reforms into operation.  In line with the Government decision, the group which is chaired by the Department of Social Protection, held its first meeting in early May.   The implementation phase is expected to take three to five years.  The implementation group is cognisant of the current and emerging economic condition and will conduct extensive consultation on the many aspects of the framework before presenting final options to Government for decision.  The group will develop a communications strategy to ensure that all stakeholders and interested parties are kept informed of the progress being made in implementing the framework.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 295 together.</P>
        <P>The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  In particular, the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population. There are currently six workers for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050.  Increasing State pension age is one of the ways in which we can sustain the pensions system and also maintain the value of the State pension at 35% of average earnings. People are living longer and healthier lives with average life expectancy set to rise even further in the future, up to 89 years for women and 83 for men. People will still, therefore, be spending at least the same amount of time in retirement as they are today, even with a later State pension age.</P>
        <P>Therefore, as announced as part of the National Pensions Framework, the State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the removal of the State pension (transition), thereby standardising State pension age at 66.  This means that the last group of people to receive the State pension (transition) will be those who reach 65 years of age in 2013.  State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  The details and timeframes for these changes are set out in the National Pensions Framework, which was published on 3 March 2010.   An implementation group chaired by my Department has been established to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the necessary reforms into operation.</P>
        <P>In addition to the changes being made to State pensions, both employees and employers must be encouraged to change their attitudes to working longer. At the workplace level, employers must seek to retain older employees and create working conditions which will make working longer both attractive and feasible for the older worker.  Where this is not possible and people leave paid employment before State pension age, they will be entitled to apply for another social welfare payment until they become eligible for a State pension, as is the current situation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 85 together.</P>
        <P>I have made available to the House two tables showing details of performance targets and average processing times for all schemes.  Table 1 sets out the target performance standard and the performance achieved for each scheme in the month of April 2010 and the average number of weeks taken to process  each claim type.  Details of cases currently on appeal and average appeals processing times are detailed in Table 2. Table 2 sets out the number of appeal cases pending in each of the schemes at end April 2010 and the average number of weeks taken to process appeals in each scheme in 2009.   In relation to the cases under appeal it should be noted that the back to education scheme and the household benefits schemes are non statutory and therefore are not appealable.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  To this end, operational processes and procedures and the organisation of work are reviewed in all areas of the Department.  These reviews are supported by modern technology, the potential of which is continuously harnessed.  Claims are processed in the most efficient and expeditious way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.  Processing times vary across schemes because of both the volume of applications and the differing qualification criteria.  For example, means assessments are required for all of the social assistance schemes; medical examinations are required for some of the illness related schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence conditions.  In the case of the insurance-based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.  It should also be noted that many factors outside the Department&rsquo;s control can impact upon claim processing times e.g. the supply of relevant information by the customer, employers, other EU countries or other third parties.</P>
        <P>While every effort is made to decide on entitlement for any individual person as close to their eligibility date as possible, there are cases where delays will necessarily be experienced. <Col N="118"/> In situations where customers find themselves suffering financial hardship while awaiting such a decision, the facility to receive supplementary welfare allowance funded by the Department and administered by the Health Service Executive is available.  In April 2010 more than 96% of basic SWA applications were decided on and paid within a week.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide details of the changes he plans to make to the maximum rate of rent supplement. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The schemes primary purpose is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently almost 95,500 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment &mdash; an increase of over 58 per cent since the end of 2005. The total cost of the rent supplement scheme for 2009 was &euro;511m.</P>
        <P>Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. Rent limits are set at levels that enable different types of eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household and market conditions. Furthermore, it is essential that State support for tenants does not give rise to inflated rental prices and overcharging by landlords.</P>
        <P>Setting or retaining maximum rent limits at a higher level than are justified by the open market can have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels. This in turn may worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes who are trying to support themselves without State aid.  A review of maximum rent supplement levels is in progress and is expected to be completed shortly. This process will ensure that the new rent limits reflect current market conditions throughout the country, and that they will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest> if he will take steps to amend section 7 of the Protection of Employees (Employer Insolvency) Act 1984 to ensure that in situations of insolvency involving pension deficits employees will receive at least 50% of their pension entitlements to rectify the current situations in which employees can be left with less than that. </Quest>
        <QRef>[21615/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Protection of Employees (Employer Insolvency) Act 1984 comes under the auspices of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  I understand that Section 7 of this Act provides for the payment, by that Minister, out of the Redundancy and Employers&rsquo; Insolvency Fund, of the amount of unpaid pension contributions which should have been paid by the relevant employer in respect of a period of not more than 12 months preceding the date of insolvency.  Although any questions on this legislation should be tabled to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, I can confirm that the Government has no plans to amend this section of the Act.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, some 90% of defined benefit schemes were underfunded at the end of 2008.  The vast majority of these continue to work with the Pensions Board to prepare funding proposals aimed at recovering their financial position.  Figures for 2009 which indicated an average positive return of 20% for pension schemes suggest that these funding proposals <Col N="121"/>can succeed.  Indeed, according to a survey of DB schemes undertaken by the Pensions Board at the end of 2009, the number of schemes failing the funding standard has decreased to 75%.  Clearly a lot more needs to be done.  However the approach taken by the Board to work with schemes is already showing positive results.</P>
        <P>Where schemes are forced to wind-up on the insolvency of their employer, the Government has introduced the Pensions Insolvency Payments scheme (PIPS) which is being administered by the Department of Finance.  PIPS provides that qualifying schemes may purchase pension payments from the State at a lower rate than would be available on the open market.  In this way, it ensures that more resources from the scheme are available to offset the pension liabilities of active and deferred scheme members.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Social welfare legislation does not currently provide for the reimbursement to the Department by insurance companies of social welfare payments deducted from awards of special damages in respect of loss of earnings.  As data on the numbers of clients who hold private insurance or whose loss of income was covered through an insurance claim is not routinely collected by the Department, it is not possible to produce robust estimates of how much money might be reimbursed, and what savings would consequently arise, if the legislation in this area were to be amended.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 82 together.</P>
        <P>The Citizens Information Board (CIB) is responsible for supporting the provision of information, advice, and advocacy on a wide range of public and social services on behalf of the Department. Funding of some &euro;45.8m has been allocated to the CIB in 2010.  The Citizens Information Board administers funding to the network of 42 Citizen Information Services (CIS) which operate from 262 locations nationwide comprising 110 centres and 152 outreach services.  The board of the CIB has approved funding of &euro;13.3m to the Citizen Information Services in 2010, which is an increase of &euro;400,000 on funding available in 2009.  In addition, the CIB <Col N="122"/>provides development and support services, including a range of training supports; ICT infrastructure; supports to CIS Boards in relation to governance, financial and HR matters, as well as developing and publishing a wide range of resource materials relating to social services and entitlements.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) transferred to the CIB in July 2009.  There are 51 MABS companies providing money advice to clients operating from 65 locations around the country, as well as the National Traveller MABS which operates on a national basis.  The CIB Board has allocated some &euro;18m to MABS in 2010.  In addition, MABS National Development Limited (NDL) is funded by the CIB to provide a national support and development service to local MABS companies.  Its functions include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The provision of casework technical support for staff</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The management of the MABSIS statistics system</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />MABS training unit which provides training support for all staff and local boards of management</P>

	<P>The determination of a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is made in accordance with Section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended.  Subsection (4) specifically directs the deciding officer to &ldquo;take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, including, in particular, the following:</P>
<P el="5">(a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</P>
<P el="5">(b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</P>
<P el="5">(c) the nature and pattern of the person&rsquo;s employment;</P>
<P el="5">(d) the person&rsquo;s main centre of interest, and</P>
<P el="5">(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.&rdquo; </P><Col N="123"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These five specified factors have been derived from European Court of Justice case law which examined the concept of habitual residence in the context of social welfare benefits. The Department&rsquo;s guidelines go on to point out that &ldquo;No single factor is conclusive. The evidential weight to be attributed to each factor will depend on the circumstances of each case. It is necessary to weigh up all the information and balance the evidence for and against an applicant satisfying the habitual residence condition&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The current guidelines address the issue of returning emigrants very specifically under the heading:</P>
<P LI="1" el="10">Resuming previous residence.</P>
<P LI="1" el="0">&ldquo;A person who had previously been habitually resident in the State or within the Common Travel Area and who moved to live and work in another country and then resumes his/her permanent residence in the State may be regarded as being habitually resident immediately on his/her return to the State.  In determining habitual residence in such cases the deciding officer should take account of:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />purpose of return e.g. expiry of foreign residence permit;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the applicant&rsquo;s stated intentions</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />verified arrangements which have been made in regard to returning on a long-term basis e.g. transfer of financial accounts and any other assets;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />length and continuity of the previous residence in the State;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the record of employment or self employment in another State; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />whether s/he has maintained links with the previous residence and can be regarded as resuming his/her previous residence rather than starting a  new period of residence.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I am satisfied that Irish nationals returning to live in Ireland on a permanent basis should experience no difficulty in demonstrating that they satisfy the requirements of the Habitual Residence Condition.</P>

	<P>Social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of &ldquo;property owned but not personally used or enjoyed&rdquo; is assessable for means testing purposes. Such property includes houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use. However, it does not include property such as the home or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business. No changes to the current arrangements have been introduced in recent years. However, compre<Col N="124"/>hensive guidelines in relation to the assessment of property were issued to relevant staff in my Department in November last year.</P>
        <P>For assessment purposes, the current market value of the property is established as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages on that property. The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed by reference to a formula. Where the current market value is less than the outstanding mortgage, no assessment is made.  The current market value of a property is the best estimate of what would be achievable if the property was offered for sale. Such an estimate will have regard to reductions in prices over recent years.</P>
        <P>In establishing the current market value of a property, my Department may make enquiry of the State Valuation Office. Alternatively, the market value may be established through receipt of a reasonable current valuation from a registered auctioneer, with reference to the purchase price and date of purchase of the property or, alternatively, the inspector may agree a valuation with a customer having regard to the type and location of the individual property and prevailing market values in that area.  Where a claimant considers that a decision on his or her claim is based on a market value of a property which is too high, he or she may appeal that decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

        <Quest> the action he is taking to ensure that the PPS number of every landlord is collected and recorded by his Department in respect of every rent supplement tenancy and made available to the Revenue Commissioners. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 888 of the Taxes Acts places an obligation on the Department to provide the Revenue Commissioners with payment details relating to rent supplement on an annual basis. Section 123 of the Finance Act 2007 Act places an additional obligation on the Department and the Health Service Executive (HSE) to request a PPS No. or Tax Reference Number from a landlord before payment of the supplement is made and it obliges the landlord to comply with the request in time for the HSE to have the information before payment is made. Neither the Department nor the HSE have any responsibility in monitoring or enforcing landlord compliance. This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and the Department provides all possible cooperation to assist them in this task.</P>
        <P>The Department and the Revenue Commissioners have arranged for the collection of landlord PPS/Tax Reference Numbers to apply to new rent supplement claims registered from 28th October 2008 and to be returned as part of the annual return.  Arrangements were put in place by the Department, with effect from 28th October 2008 to automate the process for the HSE to request the landlord&rsquo;s relevant PPS/Tax Reference Number. On receipt of the relevant tax details from the landlord the Executive were also provided with the facility to record the relevant number on the Department&rsquo;s IT system to facilitate an electronic transfer of information to the Revenue Commissioners.  The HSE has advised the Department that it has now amended the rent supplement application form to include a section requesting the landlord PPS &amp; Tax Reference Number. This now removes the requirement for a separate letter to issue separately to the landlord for the majority of cases.</P>
        <P>Revenue are notified where a landlord fails to provide a PPS number or Tax Reference, so that they can pursue the matter.  The Department has recently contacted the HSE to ensure <Col N="125"/>that all landlord PPS/Tax Reference Numbers that have been received by the HSE are updated on the Department&rsquo;s computer records in accordance with its statutory obligations.</P>

	<P>The CSO&rsquo;s monthly Overseas Travel  release contains data on the number of visitors to Ireland classified by their country of residence.  These results are obtained from the CSO&rsquo;s Country of Residence Survey which is carried out continuously at the airports and ports in the Republic of Ireland.  The CSO&rsquo;s quarterly Tourism and Travel release collects data on the number of visitors to Ireland classified by purpose of journey and residency. Data on activities, such as angling, are not available from either the Overseas Travel or the Tourism and Travel releases.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Survey of Travellers also collects information from visitors to Ireland, including participation in activities. This is a survey of departing passengers only who have spent at least one night in the Republic of Ireland. This data is then used with the results of the CSO&rsquo;s Country of residence survey to obtain estimates for total participation in different activities.  The F&aacute;ilte Ireland Survey of Travellers estimated that a total of 132,000 visitors participated in Angling in 2009, this represents a decline of 7% on 2008 figures. Estimates of average annual participation in different types of angling activity for the years 2006 to 2008 are detailed in the following table.</P>

	<P>The Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security met twice in 2009, on 29 April and 7 October.  The Committee&rsquo;s first meeting of 2010 is scheduled to take place in early June.  Issues relating to Climate Change negotiations at EU level are also considered when appropriate by the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs, while relevant issues are discussed regularly at meetings of the full Government when that is appropriate.</P>
        <P>It would be incorrect to correlate the number of meetings of the Cabinet Committee with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing Climate Change and Energy Security issues.

	<P>As previously advised to this House, work is underway in my Department on the examination of a possible scheme of Loan Guarantees for the SME sector which could augment lending by banks by addressing particular market failures. This is in line with one of the recommendations contained <Col N="130"/>in the Mazars Review on Bank Lending to SMEs.  Enterprise Ireland and Forfas carried out examinations of loan guarantee schemes in the UK and in some other countries. Following more detailed examination, Forfas has recently submitted a report to my Department which is being considered. On completion of this work I will bring the results before the Government. As with any initiative, we will need to ensure that any scheme developed directly assists businesses, facilitates genuine additional lending in the market and, at the same time, safeguards the interests of the taxpayer.</P>

	<P>Following the European Commission&rsquo;s 2007 Green Paper,<i></i>&ldquo;The European Research Area: New Perspectives,&rdquo;<i></i>the Commission launched a number of initiatives aimed at achieving the ERA, including a Communication, published in May 2008, on  <i>&ldquo;Better careers and more mobility: A European Partnership for researchers,&rdquo;</i> which targeted four key areas for improving researcher careers and mobility, namely:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />open recruitment and portability of grants</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />meeting the social security and pension needs of mobile researchers,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />attractive employment and working conditions and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />enhanced training, skills and experience for researchers.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Commission emphasised the &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; approach to its initiative, recognising the distinct competences of the Member States and the Commission in relevant areas. This approach was endorsed by the Competitiveness Council in September 2008 when the Council adopted Conclusions on <i>&ldquo;Better careers and more mobility: A European Partnership for researchers&rdquo;</i> and invited Member States to draw up National Action Plans comprising definition of national objectives and actions, on the basis of the priority lines of action proposed by the Commission, or any other appropriate actions, and to report regularly on actions undertaken or envisaged.</P>
        <P>Ireland welcomed this initiative and is supportive of the concept of the European Partnership for Researchers between the Commission and the Council and the Member States.  My Department has responsibility for preparing the National Action Plan and is currently drawing up a draft Action Plan. The plan will take into account consultations with key stakeholders, which have yet to be completed. The Action Plan, when completed, will record the state of progress in relation to relevant issues, recognising the competences of the relevant bodies in relation to further progress.</P><Col N="131"/>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s National Action Plan is our plan of actions to improve researcher careers and mobility in line with overall EU partnership, taking into account our specific circumstances.  It will address each of the four areas targeted by the European Commission and, in doing so, will also highlight areas where progress has already been made, for example:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The implementation of the European Scientific Visa (Hosting Agreement Scheme) under Council Directive 2005/71/EC on Third Country Researchers;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of the Irish Researchers Mobility Office, a one-stop shop for researchers linked to the European Researchers Mobility Portal, (now &ldquo;Euraxess&rdquo;) which is operated by the Irish Universities Association and supported by my Department; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The adoption of the European Charter and Code for researchers in all seven of the Irish Universities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 to 96, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by IDA Ireland that there are 5 IDA supported projects located in the IDA Business Park in Navan, County Meath.  I am delighted to say that, earlier this year, one of these companies, Generali PanEurope (GPE) and Generali International (GI) announced that they have commissioned a new building, to be located on the Park.  The new building will act as Generali PanEurope&rsquo;s Headquarters and Generali International&rsquo;s Irish base.  Generali has had a presence in Navan since 1999.  Since then its operations have grown significantly and employment has increased fivefold. Combined, Generali International and Generali PanEurope employ over 100 people in Navan. It is envisaged that the numbers employed will continue to increase over the coming years, solidifying Generali&rsquo;s long term commitment to Navan and reflecting both companies&rsquo; growth plans.</P>
        <P>The remaining IDA supported companies located on the park are BT Ireland, Europ Assistance Holdings, PNC International and Welch Allyn Ltd. As employment figures in individual IDA companies are provided in confidence for statistical purposes only, it is not possible to provide details of the number of jobs gained and lost in IDA supported companies on the Park.  Details of the number of jobs gained and lost in IDA companies in County Meath in 2008 and 2009 are shown on the attached tabular statement.  Figures for 2010 will not be available until <Col N="132"/>early 2011.  I have been informed by IDA that, to date in 2010, there have not been any site visits to County Meath.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</askee>
        <Quest> the length of time it is taking for employers to obtain their rebate of payment of statutory redundancy; the maximum waiting time for payment; the number of staff allocated to that task; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</P>
        <P>The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate applications from employers submitted by post from October 2009 and those filed on-line from November 2009, so that the waiting time is approximately 6 to 7 months depending on the manner of filing the application.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from September/October 2009.  In some instances where the necessary supporting documentation for claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Almost <b>doubling the number of staff</b> working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s <b>overtime budget</b> towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Establishment of a <b>special call handling facility</b> in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website;</P><Col N="133"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the <b>offset of redundancy rebate payments</b> by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008, and made corresponding payments totalling  &euro;336m, which results in average weekly payments to the value of &euro;6.5m being issued.  In the period 2007-2009, the level of new claims lodged with my Department has increased cumulatively by 200%.   This contrasts with the previous two-year period 2005-2007 in which period the increase in new claims lodged was just 10%. During the period 1 January 2010 to 30 April, 2010, 23,593 claims were received and 27,592 were processed to the value of &euro;159m which is a weekly average of &euro;9.4m.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</P>

        <Quest> the reason for the ongoing delay in processing an application to the insolvent fund within his Department from persons (details supplied) who were made redundant from a company in County Roscommon; when the outstanding moneys will be awarded; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to both the Redundancy and Insolvency Payments Schemes on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  I can confirm that my Department processed and paid claims under the Insolvency Payments Scheme in respect of Arrears of Wages, Holiday Pay and Minimum Notice for the person concerned and other former employees of this company in April 2010.  I can also confirm that my Department received a Redundancy lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 4 January 2010.  This claim awaits processing.  In respect of redundancy lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from September/October 2009.</P>
        <P>On the Redundancy side the scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.  Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</P>

In the year to date, inroads have been made on the backlog of claims on hand, which reduced from 41,168 at the end of January to 36,333 at the end of April 2010.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 23 June 2009.</P>
        <P>In instances such as this, where the employer does not formally wind the company up but goes into informal insolvency and is unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Department seeks from the employer evidence of inability to pay the entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company&rsquo;s Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.</P>
        <P>If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.  In the present instance, my Department has been in contact with the employer seeking to obtain all of the necessary documentation and the employer has, at this point, provided some but not all of the documentation. Upon receipt of the outstanding documentation and if this is in order, it should be possible to process the claim for payment shortly thereafter.</P>
        <P>If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee&rsquo;s right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.</P>

        <P>IDA is fully committed to securing balanced regional development, including winning investment for the Border region. Indeed, one of the high level goals set out in the IDA strategy document, entitled <b><i>&ldquo;Horizon 2020</i></b>&rdquo;, is that, in the period 2010 to 2014, 50% of FDI projects will be located outside of Dublin and Cork.  As part of its strategy to attract inward investment, IDA Ireland introduces a prospective client company to 3 or 4 selected locations, which can meet the company&rsquo;s requirements for skills, labour, site and/or building(s), and infrastructure.  However, the promoting company takes the final decision on location in all cases.</P>

	<P>I am in receipt of the Deputy&rsquo;s representations in this regard and will respond in full shortly.  I am advised that the person concerned holds a current Work Permit valid until 19 September 2010 with a particular employer as stated on the Permit.  In the event that a person changes employer, it is a requirement of the Employment Permits legislation to apply for a new Work Permit with the new employer.  Indeed, it is considered an offence under the Employment Permit Act 2006, to work for an employer other than the employer stated on the Work Permit issued.</P>
        <P>Details in relation to the documentation required, fees and application forms can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.deti.ie.  The individual should submit details of his employment history and current circumstances with the application form and these will be considered by the Employment Permits Section of my Department.  As a Permit holder for a reasonably long period of time in the State, I would recommend also that the individual maintain his immigration and Permit permissions up to date as this may lead to difficulties should he wish to apply for residency at a future date with the Department of Justice and Law Reform.</P>

	<P>The table appended lists the Offices, agencies, and other bodies and groups currently under the aegis of my Department.  The funding allocated to each of these entities by my Department between 2007 and 2010 inclusive is also provided.  The allocations include Exchequer funding and, where appropriate, National Training Fund monies. </P>
        <P>In addition to the core funding provisions set out on the table, my Department also makes payments from time to time in respect of certain once-off payments, such as legal costs, which arise for some of the Offices under my Department&rsquo;s remit.  My Department has also made payments to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board in respect of legal costs.  While the Board primarily funds its operational costs through fees charged in the course of its activities, my Department has been advised by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act, 2003, does not allow such fees to be used to cover non-operational legal costs.  My Department therefore bears such costs.</P>
        <P>In addition to allocations from my Department, some of the agencies listed on the table below receive funding from other sources, such as fees, property rental, grant refunds, and from other Departments or bodies.  Funding from these sources is not included in the table.  Responsibility for F&Aacute;S and Skillnets and for the National Training Fund (NTF) transferred to the Minister for Education and Skills on 1 May 2010. However, the full 2010 allocation for both of these bodies, and for bodies under my remit that are funded from the NTF, is provided for the Deputy&rsquo;s information.</P>

	<P>I can assure the Deputy that IDA Ireland is in constant contact with Kostal both in Ireland and in Germany.  A number of meetings have been held with local Irish management and parent company management recently and further meeting are planned.  I am aware of the difficult automotive environment over the past 18 months, from which Kostal is now emerging.  The company is well positioned to benefit as the market improves given its reputation/market leadership positions and its ongoing investment in new technology and people. </P>
        <P>IDA is fully engaged with Kostal to secure the long term future of its operations in Abbeyfeale and Mallow.  The Agency also engages closely with the German parent, Kostal Gmbh to identify and explore opportunities to transform Kostal Ireland as a Centre of Excellence for electronics in the Group and maintain its leadership position within this sector through investment in new technology, training and research and development.  IDA continues to explore opportunities in the wider Group with local and parent company management in positioning Ireland as a key location for future investment.  It is my intention to meet with many important companies for Ireland, such as Kostal, over the coming period.</P>

	<P>Under Public Financial Procedures, at the end of each financial year unspent Voted monies must normally be surrendered to the Department of Finance.  However, under the Multi-Annual Capital Envelope Framework, up to 10% of unspent Capital allocations in any year may be carried over to the following year.  Table 1 below sets out the Exchequer provision for my Department for each of the years 2007, 2008 and 2009, along with the unspent surplus, the amount of un-used Capital allocations carried over to the subsequent year, and the net amount surrendered to the Department of Finance.  Table 2 sets out the main areas where savings were realised in each of the years in question.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the campaign being run by the Migrant Rights Centre to reform the employment permit system to enable migrant workers to change jobs more easily; if he will alter the employment permits to give full effect to section 8(3) of the Employment Permits Act 2006, which allows workers to change employment within a particular sector; if he intends to <Col N="141"/>support this campaign and act on these proposals; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Employment Permits Act 2006 sets out in legislation the rules governing employment permits.  One of the main objectives of this Act was to increase the rights and protections afforded to migrant workers and the means to ensure redress in the event of exploitative practices. The Act&rsquo;s provisions give immigrants greater freedom, autonomy and control over their own employment choices by enabling workers for the first time to apply and re-apply for their own permit and allowing workers to change their employer after a period of a year and move to another employment in order to take advantage of better conditions or career options.  Last year, my Department issued almost 1,500 employment permits in respect of employees changing to new employers.</P>
        <P>A properly controlled employment permit system requires that permits be issued to a specific employee for a specific job with a specific employer.  To do otherwise would not only risk abuse of the employment permit system but would make it much more difficult to ensure that employers observed the employment rights of employees.  The Employment Permits Act 2006 allows for regular review of Ireland&rsquo;s economic migration policies and my Department keeps these policies under review, in line with the emerging needs of the labour market, on an on-going basis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 to 111, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Pfizer&rsquo;s plan to cut its worldwide workforce by 6,000 in 14 sites over the next four years is aimed at integrating the Pfizer and Wyeth manufacturing and supply organizations, which have significant overcapacity following the Pfizer takeover of Wyeth late last year.  After the completion of the reorganisation Pfizer will still be one of the largest and most strategic employers in Ireland, employing in excess of 4,000 people.  It will continue to have manufacturing oper<Col N="142"/>ations at 7 separate locations.  I have asked the IDA to immediately start to explore the possibility of other major players in life science sector taking over the facilities.</P>
        <P>While any impact on jobs at the facilities in Loughbeg and Shanbally in Cork, and in D&uacute;n Laoghaire in Dublin, are not due to occur until 2012 to 2014, IDA is confident that a buyer will be found for at least some of its facilities and will work closely with Pfizer in this regard.  In the recent past IDA/Pfizer has been successful with the sale of its Animal Health (Fort Dodge) plant in Sligo and its Loughbeg API plant, preserving jobs at both locations.  Pfizer was approved and paid grant assistance in respect of the Loughbeg facility.  However, since this was some time ago, there is now no repayment liability attaching to the assistance paid.  In respect of the facility in Shanbally, Cork, Pfizer was not paid grant assistance.</P>
        <P>The Government will work to support Pfizer&rsquo;s growth plans in Ireland.  They will secure further investment from Pfizer in Ireland, particularly in the Biopharma and services areas.  I will keep the House informed of any significant developments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The table below sets out the amount spent on legal advice in relation to export credit insurance from 2000 to 2010.  This predominantly relates to issues arising from the scheme operated by this Department for several decades but which ceased operation in 1998.  Part of the 2010 payment (&euro;2,276.61) relates to work on the assessment of a possible reintroduction of State-supported Export Credit Insurance.  The fees incurred in the years 2000-2003 related primarily to a major legal action involving the Department at that time.  The expenses incurred since then relate primarily to legal work involved in the recovery of debt on old policies, which had previously been considered irrecoverable.  However as a result of the Department&rsquo;s work in pursuing these cases in recent years, a total of &euro;6.6m has been recovered for the State to date. </P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the rate of VAT on the supply of insemination services is 13.5%, regardless of the form of the service.  The various rates mentioned to by the Deputy appear to refer to the different systems of VAT operating for farmers depending on whether they are registered for VAT or not.  A farmer who is registered for VAT must charge VAT on the supply of all farm services, including insemination services, at the VAT rate appropriate to that service; which in this case is 13.5%.</P>
        <P>Where a farmer is not registered for VAT he or she does not charge VAT on any farming services being supplied.  However, where an unregistered farmer supplies any agricultural produce or service, including insemination, to a VAT-registered person, the farmer may add a flat-rate addition of 5.2% to the amount invoiced to the VAT-registered person.  This flat-rate addition is designed to compensate the unregistered farmer for VAT suffered on his or her purchases.</P>

The application of the tax to coal and commercial peat is subject to a Commencement Order.  These Budget announcements are contained in Finance Act 2010 which has now been enacted.  I have no plans to suspend the carbon tax.</P>

The application of the tax to coal and commercial peat is subject to a Commencement Order.</P>
        <P>A full relief from the carbon tax applies to EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) installations in the powergen sector, but ETS installations in other sectors will be required to comply with EU minimum excise rates applying to the fuel in question. However, there is no EU minimum excise rate in the case of peat.  Solid fuels, including commercial peat, as indicated above are subject to a commencement order; this is to allow time for issues such as fuel poverty and the sourcing of coal of a lower environmental standard from Northern Ireland to be addressed.</P>
        <P>A number of Government Departments, including the Department of Finance are exploring options for how best to offset the impact of the carbon tax on low-income households.  With regard to the sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland, work has already commenced on this matter within the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In addition, the Department of Environment, my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have met with the Solid Fuel Trade Group in this regard.</P>

	<P>The carbon tax was introduced from midnight, 9 December 2009 in respect of petrol and auto-diesel.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that since its introduction, the total receipts from the carbon tax for the period January to April 2010, in respect of petrol and auto-diesel only, is &euro;53.1 million, i.e. &euro;48.4 million from the carbon charge and an estimated &euro;4.7 million in respect of VAT.  It should be noted that the carbon charge in respect of petrol and auto-diesel is payable in the month after it is released for consumption so each of the monthly figures below relate to sales in the previous month. </P>

They will make available for targeted lending not less than &euro;3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011.  The two banks were required to submit SME lending plans both by geography and sector for 2010 and 2011 in light of the &euro;3 billion target.  These plans were recently submitted to my Department and they are being reviewed by my officials and Mr. John Trethowan, the Credit Reviewer.

	<P>Services supplied by State bodies, including local authorities, will become subject to VAT from 1 July 2010.  This is as a consequence of the European Court of Justice case C-544/07 against Ireland on 16 July 2009, which ruled that Ireland should amend its VAT legislation to provide that State and public bodies are in general subject to VAT.  This case goes back to 2004 when infringement proceedings were taken by the European Commission against Ireland.  Given the time that has passed since the Court&rsquo;s Judgement, and since the commencement of the case, it is imperative that the VAT implementation takes place as soon as possible.  1 July 2010 was chosen as the date of implementation of VAT in this regard in order to allow time to process the relevant legislation and for State and public bodies, including local authorities, to prepare for the change to their administrative systems.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Exchequer revenue implications of the application of VAT to the activities of public bodies, including local authorities, this will be difficult to estimate, even after the tax has been applied for some time.  It is considered that there should be some positive revenue yield for the Exchequer, but, it will be far lower than might be initially envisioned.  While yield will accrue from the VAT being applied to services that were up to now exempt, any VAT charged to business customers will be reclaimed by them in the normal manner resulting in a Revenue neutral position in so far as those customers are concerned.  Public bodies will now be in a position to claim VAT input credit in respect of VAT paid on the inputs they use in providing their services, which they can not do at present. Consequently, any Exchequer gain from VAT being charged by public bodies will be reduced by VAT on input claims by public bodies and also by the business recipients of public body services.</P>
        <P>With regard to the suggestion that VAT revenues generated from local authorities be ring-fenced in order to reduce local authority rates that apply to business, it is the general practice not to ring-fence revenues for specific purposes but rather take an overall view on priorities in the context of expenditure and budgetary decisions which, of course, are dependent on Exchequer revenues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The submission forwarded by the Deputy refers to amendments to Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 contained in the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010.  The submission seeks the deferral of the insertion of the new Sections <Col N="150"/>35A and 35B, stating that the conditions attached require consultation and much further discussion.  I do not agree with this proposition for the following reasons.</P>
        <P>Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 imposes limits on credit unions in relation to longer-term lending.  The restrictions contained in Section 35 are an important asset and liability instrument which has protected the financial stability of the credit union movement over many years.  The matter was considered by my Department following extensive consultation with the two credit union representative bodies &mdash; the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) and the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA) &mdash; and with the Registrar of Credit Unions.  I have decided that, in addition to extending from 20% to 30% the proportion of a credit union loan book that may apply to loans over five years, it is necessary now to give the Registrar of Credit Unions powers to require credit unions to have appropriate liquidity, provisioning and accounting requirements in place.</P>
        <P>The Registrar of Credit Unions will take a balanced and proportionate approach to the implementation of the new Section 35 requirements and has set out for the credit union representative groups transitional arrangements and clarifications on the implementation approach.  These include transitional arrangements for a 15% provisioning requirement up to 30 September 2011, trial periods, exceptions with regard to top-up loans and relaxation of the 100% provisioning requirement in respect of rescheduled loans which have missed two or more payments. The transitional arrangements as proposed by the Registrar will help to ease the position for credit unions in the current financial year and the next financial year ending in September 2011. They will also allow time for credit unions to adjust to the new regime.  The effect of the new provisions on credit unions will be closely monitored.</P>
        <P>The submission also refers to requirements imposed by the Registrar of Credit Unions in relation to the holding of Regulatory Reserves by credit unions. Reserves enable credit unions to deal with future uncertainties and to act flexibly in adverse economic conditions. This is a separate requirement to the obligation on boards of credit unions to ensure that adequate provisions are made for bad and doubtful loans.  I am advised that the Total Regulatory Reserve is comprised of the Statutory Reserve and, where relevant, an amount held in a non-distributable additional regulatory reserve account.  A minimum of 8 per cent of total assets must be held in the Statutory Reserve and the remaining 2 per cent may be held in the Statutory Reserve or additional regulatory reserve account.  Financial institutions, including credit unions, are required to hold minimum levels of regulatory reserves as well as making adequate provisions for bad and doubtful debts.  The economic environment in which we now operate places increased emphasis on the maintenance of adequate reserves and credit unions are expected to operate with a level of reserves above the minimum regulatory requirement and to comply with the requirements issued by the Registrar of Credit Unions.</P>
        <P>As I indicated during the second stage debate on the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010, there is a balance to be struck between meeting members&rsquo; needs to reschedule loans and ensuring the stability of the credit union sector overall. It is in the interests of every credit union in the country that the stability of the sector is safeguarded. The proposals being brought forward in connection with the Bill will achieve this fundamental aim.</P>

	<P>The cycle to work scheme came into operation on 1 January 2009.  With a view to keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers, there is no notification procedure for employers involved. Accordingly, the Revenue Commissioners do not have statistics on the uptake of the scheme by employers or employees. The scheme operates on a self-administration basis, and relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of their particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation.</P>
        <P>The purchase of bicycles and associated safety equipment by employers for employees or directors is subject to the normal Revenue audit procedure with the normal obligations on employers to maintain records (e.g. delivery dockets, invoices, payments details, etc.).  The employer is also obliged to keep all salary sacrifice agreements entered into between the employer and employees/ directors, together with all signed statements from employees/directors regarding use of the bicycles and safety equipment.  It was estimated at the time of the introduction of the scheme that approximately 7,000 employees would avail of it over the first five year period of its operation (the exemption may apply only once in any five year period in respect of any employee).</P>

	<P>Section 5 of the Finance Act 2009 was amended whereby the level of tax relief investors can claim on the interest for mortgages and loans on residential rental properties was reduced to 75% of the interest accrued from 7th April 2009. This measure was introduced at a time when mortgage interest rates were at historical lows and the repayment burden on investors had been reduced significantly. The fact that rents are falling, after a number of years of strong growth was taken into consideration in framing the supplementary Budget 2009 and on this basis it was decided to reduce rather than abolish this relief. It should be borne in mind that ordinary workers on relatively modest incomes are being asked to make additional contributions to help with the recovery in public finances and it is felt that it is fair and equitable that residential investors contribute a proportionate share of the burden of adjustment needed in this economy.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of the Tax Acts, a person in receipt of rental income is assessed to income tax on the net amount of the rents received (i.e. the gross rents less allowable expenses incurred in earning those rents). In computing the net amount of the rents received, only those <Col N="152"/>deductions that are specified in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 are allowable. The main deductible expenses are: Any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease; The cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant; The cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property; Interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property; and Payment of local authority rates in the case of rateable properties used for commercial purposes.</P>
        <P>As payment of the new local authority charge for residential properties is not included on the list of allowable deductions, it is not an allowable expense in computing taxable rental income.  As is normal practice the tax treatment of interest payments on loans for rented residential property together with all other taxation issues will be given due consideration in the context of ongoing budgetary and taxation policy.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that initially the person concerned took out a new mortgage in 2003.  A further new mortgage was taken out in 2007.  Immediately prior to the 2010 Finance Act, mortgage interest relief was only available for a maximum of seven tax years.  On that basis, the person concerned ceased to be granted mortgage interest tax relief at the end of 2009, covering the seven tax years 2003-2009 inclusive.  When the precise status of the 2007 mortgage was clarified by Revenue in January 2010, following contact with the person concerned, Revenue determined that relief was due on that mortgage.  It was on that basis therefore, that the entitlement was reinstated by Revenue. </P>

        <Quest>   if his attention has been drawn to the fact that significant supplies of plastic film used for the wrapping of baled silage are being sold from Northern Ireland with no VAT being charged on this product; if his further attention has been drawn to the fact that legitimate farm suppliers have to charge a levy towards the recycling of the used plastic yet those who buy from the unauthorised sales persons have their used plastic collected without a problem; the amount of tax and levies that have been lost in this process over the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the VAT rules for the sale of goods (including silage wrap) from one Member State to another are as follows.  Sales between a VAT registered business in Northern Ireland and another VAT registered business (including a farmer) in this State are zero rated in Northern Ireland and the purchaser must self-account to Revenue in this State for VAT on the transaction at 21%.  Sales between a VAT registered business in Northern Ireland and a consumer in the State are subject to VAT (at the UK standard VAT rate of 17.5%) in Northern Ireland if the consumer in this State is not registered for VAT.  It is therefore legitimate for farmers to purchase their goods under either of these circumstances in Northern Ireland, subject to the VAT registration thresholds and subject to compliance by them with the self-accounting rules if they are VAT registered.</P><Col N="153"/>
        <P>The Deputy has not provided sufficient information to enable Revenue to establish if a breach of VAT legislation has occurred. From enquiries to date, Revenue is not aware of VAT problems concerning silage wrap being sold from Northern Ireland.  If the Deputy has more specific information he might provide that information to Revenue so that the matter can be investigated.</P>
        <P>With regard to the levy on plastic, I am informed by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, a wide range of obligations are imposed on both producers (i.e. manufacturers and importers) and suppliers of farm plastics (i.e. silage bale wrap and sheeting) requiring them to collect and recover such plastics at end-of-life.  As an alternative to operators self-complying in this regard, both producers and suppliers of farm plastics may contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes established for the recovery of farm plastics waste.</P>
        <P>The Irish Farm Films Producers Group (IFFPG) &mdash; which comprises membership of film manufacturers, importers and suppliers &mdash; is a not-for-profit organisation and is at present the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of operating a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics. Under the terms of its approval, the IFFPG is required to meet specified targets equating to the recovery of 60% of all farm plastics placed on the market in 2009 and in each year thereafter. Almost 12,500 tonnes of farm plastics were collected by the IFFPG in 2008 for the purpose of recycling, representing a national recovery rate of over 74% of farm plastics placed on the Irish market in that year.</P>
        <P>The scheme funds its activities by means of the imposition on producer members of an Environmental Protection Contribution (EPC) levy of &euro;127 per tonne of farm plastics placed on the Irish market. These levies are included in the sale price of the product and are passed through each step in the trading chain, down ultimately to the individual farmer. The EPC levies collected are transferred by producers to the IFFPG for the purpose of funding authorised collection agents on a nationwide basis to collect waste silage / bale wrap, before transporting it to recycling facilities both at home and abroad for reprocessing. This is an essential function which ensures that this product is, as far as possible, disposed of in a manner which is not harmful to the environment.</P>
        <P>In addition, the levy income is supplemented by a differential weight-based collection fee applied on the collection of farm plastics from both individual farmyards and designated collection points of which there were approximately 140 operating nationally in 2009. A farmer who cannot demonstrate that he has sourced farm plastic from a legitimate source must pay a higher collection fee. Neither the levy nor the collection fees are prescribed in the regulations, they are set by the Board of the IFFPG at a level that ensures their operating costs are met having regard to the producer responsibility obligations on their members.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The moratorium on recruitment and promotion was introduced by the Government at the end of March 2009.  The moratorium allows for certain general exemptions in the Education and Health Sectors for the filling of certain key posts as well as for the Local Authorities in relation to fire, health and safety, Interreg and beach warden posts.  Information in relation to the posts covered by these general exemptions can be sought from the relevant Ministers.</P>
        <P>Departments have been implementing the moratorium in respect of themselves and the bodies under their aegis.  Where a Department feels that a post should be filled, it requires the sanction of the Minister for Finance for an exception to the moratorium.  Requests for exceptions are not made in respect of every vacancy.  Unless otherwise stated in tables 2 and 3 below, the information covers the period up to the end of April 2010.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Civil Service</i></P>
<P el="0">In the case of the civil service approximately 2,300 staff have left since the introduction of the moratorium.  Approval has been given to fill some 300 posts by recruitment and some 470 posts by way of redeployment or promotion. This has resulted in a net reduction of 2,000 posts.</P>
        <P>Separate from the above, in an effort to meet the priority needs of the Department of Social Protection arising from increases in the Live Register, a temporary levy has been applied to Government Departments in order to source some 550 posts for that Department &mdash; this is being achieved on a numbers and cost neutral basis.  In addition sanction has also been given for some 276 temporary posts for Census 2011 and for various temporary &lsquo;summer relief&rsquo; type posts.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that in accordance with the terms of the moratorium, exemptions can only be sought by Government Departments and Offices after they had exhausted all internal possibilities of redeploying staff, reorganising work and so on.  In the majority of cases sanctions have been given for the filling of posts by redeployment or promotion which would not lead to an overall increase in numbers serving (since consequential vacancies are not generally filled unless specifically sanctioned.)  As the attached table shows some 770 posts were sanctioned to be filled of which some 300 are likely to be filled by external recruitment, leading to a net reduction of some 2,000 in the civil service.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Public Service</i></P>
<P el="0">My Department has received 205 requests for 1,668 exceptions (WTEs) to the moratorium in the Public Service.  147 requests have been sanctioned in full or in part in respect of 885 posts.  25 requests have been refused and a decision is pending in relation to 33 requests. Summary information by Department is set out in table 1.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Draft Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, the Government has clarified that the application of the moratorium on recruitment and promotion will be kept under review and will be revisited in each sector as the staffing levels specified (or to be specified) in the Employment Control Framework (ECF) for the sectors are achieved. ECFs for the various Vote Groups are generally in the process of being finalised at present.</P>

	<P>I have by informed by the Office of Public Works that they lease car parking spaces for a number of Departments and Offices falling under the Office of Public Works remit.  In the period 1st January 2009 to 31st December 2009, based on the information available to the Office of Public Works for the assignment of space in leased buildings to the Departments/Offices involved, the total expenditure incurred by the Office of Public Works for leased car park spaces was &euro;10,660,628, where the specific cost of leased car parking costs are defined in the lease.</P>
        <P>The criteria for compiling the answer comprises of the following:</P>

        <Quest>   the extent of moneys paid by the banks for the deposit guarantee scheme to date; if he will confirm that this money is ring fenced; the purpose for which it is intended; if he will consider using an element of this fund for the purposes of introducing a loan guarantee scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The legal basis for the Deposit Guarantee Scheme in Ireland is set out in the European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Regulations 1995 (S.I. No. 168 of 1995) as amended.  These Regulations implement the European Union Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (94/19/EC) as amended.  The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Deposit Guarantee Scheme covers 100% of retail deposits with all credit institutions authorised in Ireland (including credit unions) up to a maximum of &euro;100,000 per <Col N="208"/>qualifying depositor per institution and that the Scheme is administered by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI).</P>
        <P>The level of contribution required from each credit institution is 0.2% of eligible deposits held at all branches of the credit institution in the EEA, including deposits on current accounts and share accounts with a building society, but excluding interbank deposits and deposits represented by negotiable certificates of deposit.  While deposits held in credit unions are already covered to the extent set out above, I intend to make regulations to provide for a contribution amount specific to credit unions, in accordance with Section 4(2)(a) of the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009.</P>
        <P>Each contribution by a credit institution is maintained in a Deposit Protection Account at the CBFSAI.  The total amount currently held in Deposit Protection Accounts is approximately &euro;603.5 million.  This amount is for use only in relation to the administration of the Deposit Protection Account, including any possible pay-out in the event of an insolvency of a credit institution, as required by the legislation.  In that context, I do not propose using an element of this fund for the purposes of introducing a loan guarantee scheme as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be aware that work is underway within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the examination of a possible scheme of loan guarantees and my officials have held a number of discussions with officials of that Department on the subject.  Key concerns being addressed include the extent to which such a scheme would increase lending to SMEs (as against enhancing security for the banks) and the extent of taxpayer exposure and I understand that the work is nearing completion.</P>

The figures cover the years 2008 to date.

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in accordance with section 10(1) of the Value-Added Tax 1972 (as amended), the amount on which Value-Added Tax is chargeable is the total consideration receivable by the supplier, &ldquo;including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges whatsoever&rdquo; but not including the value-added tax itself.  As the Deputy will be aware, VAT is an EU wide tax and Irish VAT law must comply with the EU VAT Directives.  Article 78 of EU Council Directive 2006/112/EC provides that the taxable amount to which VAT is applied shall include &ldquo;taxes, duties levies and charges, excluding the VAT itself&rdquo;.  Accordingly, as in the case of excises on other products, it is correct to include any carbon tax element of a gas bill in the amount on which VAT is chargeable.</P>

	<P>The reply recently given by the Taoiseach was in response to questions about payments by that Department, and set out the total paid by that Department in relation to the Moriarty Tribunal, up to end-April 2010.  The reply which I gave on 1 April 2010 set out the total paid by the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, up to end-February 2010. The Department of the Taoiseach total to end-February 2010 was &euro;38.946 million, made up of &euro;7.752 million in Tribunal administration and &euro;31.194 million in Tribunal legal costs. The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources total to end-February was &euro;2.7 million, made up of &euro;0.136 million in administration and &euro;2.564 million in legal costs, discharged from 2002 to end-February 2010 in connection with that Department&rsquo;s involvement with the Moriarty Tribunal. The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will be able to provide information regarding the sum of &euro;2.564 million.</P><Col N="210"/>
        <P>No decision in relation to third party legal costs has been made to date by the Moriarty Tribunal and accordingly, no such costs have been paid by either Department.  Expenditure by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in relation to the Moriarty Tribunal will in future replies to Parliamentary Questions be classified and shown separately from that paid by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have noted the additional material supplied by the parties, but that it does not provide grounds for further mitigation of the interest due.  The stamp duty return is a standard process and must be completed in all cases to enable Revenue to stamp an instrument, whether a penalty is charged or not. Given the circumstances of the case, Revenue would like to invite the parties and/or their representatives to meet with officials in Dublin Stamping District to have the stamping process explained and to assist them with the completion of the return.  A letter to this effect has been issued to the parties.</P>

Dr. Kohler determined that one of the five individuals was a victim of thalidomide exposure.  The Department is not currently considering any further claims in relation to thalidomide.  However, it is open to any individual who believes themselves to be a victim of thalidomide, to forward detailed documentary evidence to the <Col N="216"/>German Agency which administers compensation to those determined as victims of the drug, for consideration of their case.</P>

        <P>I have received the report of the joint Department of Health and Children/Health Service Executive working group established to set out a proposed model for the implementation of a system of reference pricing combined with generic substitution. The report will be published shortly.  The introduction of a system of reference pricing and interchangeable medicines will promote price competition and deliver ongoing savings for both the State and for patients. I <Col N="217"/>expect to see significant progress on this in 2010, including the implementation of legislative and administrative changes required to give it effect in 2011.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 180 together.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that 65% of the population of the State reside in dwellings that are supplied with fluoridated water.  A Forum on Fluoridation was established in 2000 to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies.  The main conclusion of the Forum&rsquo;s Report in 2002 was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.  Among the studies which support this conclusion was the North South Survey of Children&rsquo;s Oral Health (2002), which showed that tooth decay levels were lower among children who get fluoride in their water supply than among children in Northern Ireland, where there is no water fluoridation.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has asked the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) to review any post-2005 evidence on the hazard profile, health effects, and human exposure to fluoride and to assess the risks that may be associated with the use of most common drinking water fluoridation agents.  It is expected that a preliminary opinion will be published shortly.</P>
        <P>The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which was established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.  Its advice, based on a review of all previous and current international and national scientific data, is that the balance of the scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, is safe and effective for protecting oral health.  In May 2007, the World Health Organisation renewed its call for Governments throughout the world to introduce water fluoridation as an efficient public health measure.</P>

        <Quest>  her views on doctors writing prescriptions for patients on medical cards month after month, without seeing the patient; her plans to forbid doctors issuing prescriptions without physically seeing the patient; her further views on whether doctors continue to write prescriptions for patients who may be on medication which should be limited to a certain period of time; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

	<P>Section 18 of the Form of Agreement with registered medical practitioners for the provision of services under section 58 of the Health Act 1970 (General Medical Services Scheme &mdash; GMS patients) states <i>&ldquo;The medical practitioner shall prescribe such drugs and medicines as he considers necessary for any person for whom he is obliged to provide services.&rdquo;</i></P>
        <P>Following discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, a repeat prescription facility, whereby prescriptions for certain drugs and medicines require renewal on a three monthly, rather than a monthly, basis, was introduced on 1 March 1991.  Under this scheme, patients who are stabilized on their medication no longer need to visit their general practitioner every month in order to have their prescriptions renewed.  Changes in GMS prescriptions from monthly to quarterly for suitable patients have created efficiencies for general practitioners and patients, by reducing unnecessary consultations and journeys to the GP and pharmacy.</P>
        <P>Under the Medical Practitioners Acts, 1978 and 2007, the Medical Council is responsible for protecting the public by promoting and better ensuring high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among doctors. Doctors must always be guided by their primary responsibility to act in the best interests of their patients.</P>

        <Quest>  the amount of unspent money returned by her Department to the Department of Finance each year since 2007; the Departmental budget for each year since 2007; the projects for which this money was originally earmarked in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the attached tables.  In 2007, &euro;55.9m was surrendered to the Department of Finance, &euro;35.7m was surrendered in 2008 and &euro;71.3m in 2009.  In areas such as statutory enquiries, legal fees and compensation payments it is very difficult in any year to accurately estimate the level of payments which may fall to be made, therefore, if the allocated amount remains unspent at the end of the year it is surrendered to the Exchequer.  Savings on allocations to health agencies have been achieved through efficiency measures and tight financial control.  Savings on my Department&rsquo;s Administrative Budget have been achieved through the non-filling of vacant posts and other efficiency measures.</P>

I wish to advise the Deputy that due to industrial action it is not possible for the Executive to supply current performance data for the ambulance services.  However if this matter remains of continuing concern to you, I would invite you to raise it with the HSE again in due course.  HIQA in conjunction with the HSE and PHECC is at present working to develop additional time-based performance standards and indicators in relation to pre-hospital emergency response.

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter of great concern that a number of children go missing after they enter the State. Separated children going missing from care is not a phenomenon unique to Ireland. The issue of separated children who go missing from care is complex. There has been a tendency to <Col N="225"/>equate all missing children with trafficking. However the HSE advise that there is evidence to indicate that some of these individuals may be adults who disappeared before a comprehensive age assessment process could be undertaken by the HSE. It has been acknowledged by the HSE and also by other relevant statutory agencies that there are several factors that may contribute to the disappearance of a child from care and these are the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The child&rsquo;s appeal for asylum has been refused and he/she is nearing eighteen and is reacting to the pending threat of repatriation.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The person has been smuggled into the country to join the workforce on a consensual basis and is availing of the child protection service as a fast track route into the State.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The child has been trafficked into the State by traffickers using the child protection service as a route.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The HSE has developed a strong working relationship with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (G.N.I.B.) in relation to missing children. The level of interagency cooperation between the H.S.E. and the G.N.I.B. has been consistently high and has intensified in recent years. A Joint National Protocol on Children who go missing from care has been agreed between the Garda and the H.S.E..  Several meetings have taken place between H.S.E. management, the G.N.I.B., and local Garda to adapt this protocol in terms of application to separated children who go missing. The following measures were agreed:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Collaborative interviewing at the ports between social workers and Garda&iacute;.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Fingerprinting of persons presenting as underage at the ports, for tracking purposes.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Planned Garda surveillance of those at risk of going missing from the point of presentation at ports to the initial placement period in hostels.</P>
   <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Monitoring of the notification system of missing persons to local Garda&iacute; to be closely monitored by Garda Inspectors.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Joint training of H.S.E. staff and Garda&iacute;/ G.N.I.B. staff in relation to children at high risk of going missing.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Sharing of photographic evidence between H.S.E. and Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Office and the H.S.E.  have also worked closely with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the development of the National Action Plan on Anti-Human Trafficking and I am committed to ensuring that we play an active part in combating trafficking as outlined in this plan.</P>
        <P>In addition the Implementation Plan arising from the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, 2009 contains a commitment that separated children will be accommodated in mainstream care, instead of hostels by December 2010. This move from hostel accommodation to residential and foster care should help to ensure that fewer children go missing. The HSE is phasing out the hostel arrangements and putting in place appropriate 24 hour care staff arrangements in the remaining hostels until they are closed. A number of hostels have already closed and the remaining ones are to close this year.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the efforts made by the HSE and GNIB to address concerns regarding separated children are yielding some progress.  Both agencies are committed to intensifying their joint work in this area with a view to preventing children from going missing and locating those who do.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>  if she has received representations from charitable organisations regarding the rate being offered to them by the National Treatment Purchase Fund for the care of residents under the nursing home scheme; if she will consider the difficulties posed in these circumstances; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[21816/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I can confirm that the Minister for Health and Children has received representations from a small number of voluntary organisations regarding the rate for the cost of care being offered to them by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). However, I understand that, of the small number of voluntary organisations currently negotiating with the NTPF, at least two of these have recently concluded agreements.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in October 2009. The commencement of the scheme brought about a fundamental change in the way in which long-term nursing home care is funded and, consequently, the way in which nursing homes and community hospitals, including the voluntary organisations referred to by the Deputy, are funded. In the past, many of these facilities were allocated a lump sum annually. In contrast, the new scheme supports the individuals in need of long-term residential care, not the facilities providing the care. This means that funding follows the patients and ensures that these facilities are not being funded for empty beds.</P>
        <P>The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires all nursing homes, including any facility which previously received funding under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004, to negotiate and agree a price for the cost of care with the NTPF should they wish to participate in the scheme. This is a necessary feature of the scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person&rsquo;s contribution. The NTPF has statutory responsibility for the negotiation of prices and is independent in the performance of its function. In carrying out this function, the NTPF has particular responsibility to ensure value for money for both the individual and the State.</P>
        <P>Finally, as stated above, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme only applies to long-term nursing home care. Nursing homes and community hospitals can continue to have separate agreements with the HSE for the provision of other services, e.g. day care, respite and convalescence.</P>

If this matter remains of continuing concern to you, I would invite you to raise it with me again in due course.  However, both my Department and the Health Service Executive are concerned to ensure that rehabilitation services and the structure of same are the most efficient and appropriate.

	<P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child. Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted. I brought forward at Committee stage an amendment to the Adoption Bill 2009 that will enable prospective adoptive parents to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague or non-bilateral country, if prior to the establishment date, they have been issued with a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt. The proposed amendment requires that the Adoption Authority (to be set up under the Act) would be satisfied that the particular adoption meets all the standards of the Hague Convention.</P>

	<P>I am currently giving consideration to the legal position with regard to the provision of aftercare services, having regard to the existing legislative provisions as set out in the Childcare Act 1991.  I met recently with Focus Ireland in this regard and had a constructive exchange of views and discussion on these matters. </P>
        <P>I have received legal advice which confirms that the obligation contained in Section 45(4) of the Child Care Act 1991 is in substance mandatory.  The legal advice is that the Act creates a statutory power and the HSE, as recipient of this power, must put itself in a position where it can exercise the power should the need arise.  Section 45(4) of the Child Care Act allows me to write to the HSE and instruct it in this or in any other regard. I intend to do this and will in parallel continue to examine legislative options.  In line with the Government commitment as reflected in the Ryan Implementation Plan funding of &euro;1.0m was set aside by the HSE in its 2010 Service Plan, for the development of aftercare services in 2010.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the issue raised by the Deputy. The NCSS has launched an investigation into this matter and it will provide a full statement once the investigation is complete.  The NCSS has assured me that the return of these <Col N="229"/>unopened letters has had no adverse overall impact on uptake levels for the CervicalCheck Programme, which aims for an uptake level of 80% in the target population.  During 2009 CervicalCheck aimed to screen 240,000 women, but in fact approximately 280,000 women were screened.   Uptake levels in 2010 continue to reach projected monthly targets. </P>
        <P>The reason for letters not reaching the intended person relate mainly to population mobility.  There are over 1.2 million women aged 25 to 60 eligible for a free smear test as part of the CervicalCheck programme. As there is no central population database in Ireland, CervicalCheck has assembled a register from information supplied by the Department of Social Protection and self registration of women.  The database used by CervicalCheck is known as the Cervical Screening Register (CSR).  The CSR is a confidential, secure electronic database containing demographic details and screening history details of women in the eligible population.  The Health (Provision of Information) Act 1997 provides the legislative framework for the compilation of the CSR.</P>
        <P>CervicalCheck communicates with every woman whose details are provided and relies upon the accuracy of such information.  If communications are not responded to, the NCSS sends a number of subsequent reminder letters to ensure that every effort is made to contact eligible women.  CervicalCheck encourages any woman who changes her address to notify the programme of the change in her details.  I understand that the information held on the CSR is used only by CervicalCheck and is not shared with any other agency.</P>

	<P>The allocation of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) provision for 2010 has been agreed between the National Transport Authority (NTA) and the CI&Eacute; operating companies as follows:</P><Col N="232"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, &euro;155.43 million;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, &euro;75.90 million;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Bus &Eacute;ireann, &euro;44.69 million. </P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">CI&Eacute; has a statutory mandate under various Transport Acts to provide PSO services passenger services.  The NTA governs the funding of these PSO services through the Public Service Contracts which are in place between Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.  These contracts set strict standards for operational performance and customer service and contain penalties for non-performance.  Currently no Exchequer funding is provided to private operators but it is expected that the NTA would tender any new routes requiring additional public subsidy over and above that provided for within existing PSO contracts.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport,</askee>
        <Quest> further to his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 647 of 3 November 2009, which stated that the International Civil Aviation Organisation would conduct a comprehensive audit of Ireland&rsquo;s system for safety oversight of civil aviation early in 2010, if the ICAO audit in question has been completed and is available for public inspection; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The audit referred to by the Deputy is the comprehensive safety oversight audit conducted by ICAO under the Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme (USOAP).  The USOAP aims to promote global aviation safety through auditing of the Contracting States&rsquo; capability for safety oversight.  The audit consists of three phases, a preparatory phase, an &ldquo;on-site&rdquo; phase and a reporting and follow-up stage.</P>
        <P>The ICAO Audit Team&rsquo;s on-site visit, from 12th-23rd March 2010, consisted of an audit of the organization, processes, procedures and programmes established and maintained by the State to help it fulfil its safety oversight obligations under the Chicago Convention.  I understand that the outcome of the audit reflected positively on the oversight of aviation safety in Ireland.  The next step in the process is the reporting and follow-up stage, during which ICAO will forward an interim report for consideration.  Subsequently, the State will provide an action plan on the findings of the report to ICAO.  ICAO will make the final report available to all Contracting States through the secure website of ICAO in November/December 2010.  When the audit process has been completed, I will make the final report available for public inspection.</P>

	<P>I have been in contact with the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) in relation to this matter.  I have been advised by the IAA that the &ldquo;Red Zone&rdquo; at the eastern end of runway 10/28 commences 60 metres from the existing runway threshold.  The IAA has further advised that all &ldquo;Red Zones&rdquo; were established based on the longest length of runway including all future expansion.  With regard to the western end of Runway 10/28, there is provision for a 400 metre extension at Dublin Airport, and the &ldquo;Red <Col N="234"/>Zone&rdquo; on the Fingal County Development Plan is positioned based on the maximum length this runway can be extended to.</P>

	<P>The Irish Prison Service is committed to the replacement of Cork Prison with a modern prison complex at Kilworth, County Cork on a site previously owned by the Department of Defence.  While the project has not advanced to detailed design stage, it is anticipated that the capacity of the new prison will be in the region of 450.</P>
        <P>A preliminary site suitability report was conducted which included reviewing its archaeology, flora and fauna, road/infrastructure, topography etc. These preliminary surveys confirmed that there are no significant constraints to the development of the site.  The next step in the appraisal process is the preparation of a detailed business case in relation to the project. The business case will examine the various procurement options including a public private partnership option. The advice of the National Development Finance Agency will also be sought in relation to the project.  It is intended to commence preliminary planning and design work on the project this year and to deliver the project on a phased basis. All aspects of the project, including the design phase and construction will be procured by means of a public tender process.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in March 2007.  All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the position regarding the Thornton Hall prison project, County Dublin; the costs incurred to date both in terms of land purchase and other matters; the estimated final cost; the estimated date of completion; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[21416/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of the new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin is proceeding on a phased basis. Phase one comprises essential enabling works required for the prison development.  These works include the construction of the dedicated access road, perimeter security wall and various off-site services.  Phase two of the project comprises the various prisoner accommodation blocks, workshops, education facilities and administration buildings.</P><Col N="238"/>
        <P>Tenders for the design and construction of the access road to serve the prison development were issued in March this year.  The competition is still in progress and it is anticipated that contract award will take place in June with construction work commencing on site in July.  It is intended that tender documents for various off-site works will be issued later this month with construction work expected to commence in September this year.  The tender documentation for the design and construction of the perimeter wall of the prison is currently at an advanced stage of preparation.  It is intended to invite tenders for this phase of the project by the end of September with the construction work commencing immediately following the completion of the access road in January 2011.  The construction of the perimeter wall is estimated to take about 12 months to complete.</P>
        <P>The National Development Finance Agency acting on behalf of the Irish Prison Service, has initiated an EU wide tender competition for the appointment of multi-disciplinary technical advisors for the project.  The technical advisors will develop the output specification and other tender documents which will be the subject of a tender competition later this year.  It is anticipated that the prison will be operational by late 2015.</P>
        <P>In relation to expenditure on the project, a total of &euro;42.24 million has been expended on the project to end March 2010.  This sum includes the site cost of &euro;29.9 million.  The cost of the site was offset by the sale of surplus prison lands at Shanganagh, County Dublin.  An additional 8.7 acres has also been acquired at a cost of &euro;1.3 million to provide a dedicated access route to the main prison site.  This was done following representations from the local community which reflected concern in relation to the potential effect of increased traffic generated by the prison development.</P>
        <P>This sum also includes &euro;7.095 million expended on professional fees, &euro;2.919 million on site preparation and various surveys, &euro;0.468 million on landscaping and &euro;0.553 million on security.  As is the case with all major infrastructure projects a comprehensive set of geological, engineering and archaeological surveys have been undertaken at the site.  These surveys will help to reduce the overall construction programme once a contract for the construction of the prison is awarded.  In relation to the overall costs of the prison development, it would not be appropriate, for commercial and procurement reasons, to disclose details of the overall cost of the new prison as the project will be the subject of an EU wide tender competition later this year.</P>

	<P>The visa application reference number 2187482 referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office, Cairo on the 12 July 2009.  Following consideration by a Visa Officer, the application was refused on the 6 August 2009.  The application was refused for the following reasons:</P>
<P LI="1" el="5">INCO:&mdash; Inconsistencies e.g. contradictions in the information supplied &mdash; The person referred to made a visa application for a &lsquo;Join-Spouse (Irish National)&rsquo;, however in supporting documentation submitted with the application a &lsquo;visit Visa&rsquo; is mentioned several times and also a request for a &lsquo;Long Stay Visa&rsquo;.  It is therefore very unclear as to what visa was actually applied for.  The person referred to was advised that if applying for a &lsquo;Join Spouse Visa&rsquo;, they must appeal this decision.  If however applying for a &lsquo;Visit Visa&rsquo; they should make a new application.  In addition, if applying for a &lsquo;visit Visa&rsquo; they should visit the following website which sets out the details in regards to application www.embassyofireland.org.</P><Col N="239"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This application was appealed on 24 August 2009 and the decision to refuse the application was upheld by the visa appeal officer on  24 August 2009.  The visa application reference number 3123752 referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office, Cairo on the 1 December 2009.  Following consideration by a Visa Officer, the application was refused on the 17 December 2009.  The application was refused for the following reasons:</P>

<P LI="1" el="5">RH:&mdash; Relationship History &mdash; Has not shown evidence of a relationship being in existence prior to visa application/marriage.  Note: For immigration purposes it is not sufficient for a relationship to have developed over the internet or by telephone/sms.  A relationship must include a number of face to face meetings (excluding webcam) between the parties.  Applicants must satisfy the Visa Officer that the relationship is bona-fide.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The visa application reference number 3696062 referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office, Cairo on the 16 March 2010.  Following consideration by a Visa Officer, the application was refused on the 13 April 2010.  The application was refused for the following reasons:</P>
<P LI="1" el="5">F:&mdash; Finances:&mdash; evidence provided is deemed insufficient or incomplete.</P>
<P LI="1" el="5">IS:&mdash; Immigration status of the reference in Ireland.  Evidence of this has not been provided &mdash; copy of passport of reference OB:&mdash; Obligations to return to home country not shown &mdash; e.g., no social, economic or professional ties in home country shown.</P>
<P LI="1" el="5">OC:&mdash; Observe the conditions of the visa &mdash; the visa sought is for a specific purpose and duration&mdash; the applicant has not satisfied the Visa Officer that such conditions would be observed.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Concerning application 3696062, it is open to the persons concerned to appeal the decision of the Visa Officer within two months of the date of refusal, in this case before the 13 June 2010.  Comprehensive information on all aspects of the visa application process and the documents required is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).<b>  </b>Each individual visa application is considered on its individual merits, with the onus resting with the applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer as to why a visa should be granted.</P>

	<P>The moratorium on public service recruitment applies to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda Commissioner is closely monitoring the levels of Garda strength around the country, taking into account the level of retirements and recent attestations of students.  I will continue to consult with my colleague the Minister for Finance on when a resumption of Garda recruitment will be necessary so as to keep Garda numbers up to approved levels.  In all this, my priority is to maintain Garda operational strength.  A necessary first step will be a competition to establish a panel of approved candidates and, as I recently indicated, I believe that this should take place later this year.  <b></b></P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of each Garda Division as at 31 December 2008 and 2009 and 31 March 2010, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was as set out in the following tables.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s 2008 Policing Plan contained the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals for re-aligning Garda Divisional boundaries to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  As a consequence of this work, the geographical areas of Garda Divisions, districts and sub-district stations were realigned while at the same time ensuring that service delivery to the community was maintained to the highest possible standard.</P>

	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Garda&iacute; for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that a vetting application in respect of the person referred to was received by the Vetting Unit.  However, the application was incomplete and has been returned to the registered organisation for completion.  Once a completed application is received by the Vetting Unit it will be processed accordingly.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that I have legislated to prohibit upward only rent reviews in leases entered into on or after 28 February of this year (section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009).  Similar action in relation to existing leases was not possible for legal and constitutional reasons.  Nonetheless, I believe that the commencement of that section will have a persuasive effect in relation to those lease arrangements.</P>
        <P>In addition, action has been taken to address concerns which have been raised about the ability of tenants to obtain reliable and comprehensive information in the context of the rent review process and a Working Group has been established with the following terms of reference: &ldquo;To consider the operation of the current system for determining the rent payable on foot of a rent review clause, with particular emphasis on the arbitration process and the adequacy of the information available to all parties and, if necessary, to make such recommendations for change as may seem appropriate.&rdquo; It is envisaged that the Group will report by 30 June, 2010.</P>
        <P>Every opportunity is also being taken to stress the need for landlords to take a flexible approach to rent review negotiations which arise in the context of current leases.  It has been emphasised repeatedly that there is nothing to stop the parties to existing business leases from varying the terms of their contract and from agreeing to reduce the applicable rent, having regard to their individual circumstances and the realities of the market.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Recruitment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by Statutory Regulation namely, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admission &amp; Appointments) Regulations 1988/2005.  Following selection by the Public Appointments Commission each applicant must also undergo a physical competency test, a medical examination and character vetting.  Section 46(1)(3) of Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 provides that that part, which deals with Public Service Employment, does not apply to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Arrangements have been put in place, where required, to facilitate members with a disability, so they can continue to work.  The information requested in relation to the number of Garda&iacute; who have disabilities is not readily available and is being collated at present.  When I have this information to hand I will contact the Deputy directly.</P>

	<P>The Garda accommodation programme is based on agreed priorities established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is brought forward in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, due to its condition, it will be necessary to vacate Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station to facilitate refurbishment of the premises.  The Office of Public Works is currently making arrangements to refurbish Mountjoy Garda Station to accommodate personnel from Fitzgibbon Street Station during the relevant period and it is expected that this work will commence shortly.</P>
        <P>I am further advised that at the Community Policing Forum meeting on 24 February last, local Garda management provided a briefing to the local community regarding the arrangements which will apply when Garda&iacute; attached to Fitzgibbon Street commence operating out of Mountjoy Garda Station.  The next meeting of the Community Policing Forum is scheduled for 26 May 2010 and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will again be present to discuss any issues of concern to the local community.</P>

	<P>I can advise the Deputy that if a person considers that a criminal offence was committed against them, that person is free to make a complaint to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  If a person considers that he or she suffered a civil wrong including a breach of their constitutional rights, it is open to him or her to take a civil action against the wrongdoer.  As the Deputy will fully appreciate it is not open to me to give legal advice to any individual on their particular individual circumstances.</P>

The refusal decision was appealed on 02/03/2010.   The Visa Appeal Officer upheld the original decision on 02/03/2010.</P>
        <P>It is the policy of the Visa Section of my Department to permit only one appeal for each visa application.  Each individual visa application is considered on its individual merits, the onus resting with the applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer as to why a visa should be granted. Comprehensive information with regard to all aspects of the visa application process and the documents required is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie). It is open to the individual to make a fresh application if they so wish.</P>

I am further informed that the case was heard at Cavan District Court on 26 February, 2009, when the summonses against the accused were dismissed.</P>
        <P>I have no role in the investigation, prosecution or trial of alleged offences.  This is a long standing principle of our system of justice.  The role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the DPP.  The question of whether or not a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP.  The DPP, who is independent in the performance of his functions, makes his decision on the basis of the Garda findings viewed against the background of common and/or statute law.  Similarly, the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and the conduct of any court case is a matter entirely for the presiding judge.</P>

        <P FLI="0">All expenditure figures provided for 2009 above are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The figures for the Dublin prisons have been amalgamated as many of these <Col N="250"/>items would have been procured centrally through the Regional Distribution Centre within the Irish Prison Service. In respect of expenditure on balls, the figures provided relate to the purchase of balls for use in a variety of sports including tennis, football, hand-ball, squash, table tennis and basketball.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, there are significant benefits to be gained from participating in  physical education, be it in a community setting or in the prison environment. In the prison setting, physical education affords prisoners the opportunity to take control of one aspect of their daily life, namely their physical well-being. This has the potential  knock-on effect of increasing their motivation and confidence to tackle other identified issues such as substance abuse and to take up educational or workshop opportunities.  It is also recognised that physical education, sport and recreation play a significant role in the management of prison life by providing positive outlets for energy.</P>
        <P>The level of expenditure in the sports and recreation area, in any particular year, would be affected by the number of prisoners in custody and the requirement to adequately fit-out any new facilities provided during the year. In relation to 2009, the average daily number of prisoners increased by almost 10% on the previous year and there was a requirement to fit-out new accommodation blocks at Castlerea, Portlaoise and Wheatfield.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As stated in the House in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 20 May, the Government is extremely concerned about the recent surge in violence in Thailand, including the Army assault on the protesters&rsquo; encampment in central Bangkok early on the morning of 19 May and the violence which has occurred both in Bangkok and in the provinces following the military intervention.  I am deeply concerned by reports that 15 people were killed and hundreds injured during the intervention, in addition to the thirty-six deaths which had already occurred since 13 May.</P>
        <P>The protests in Bangkok have been led by the United Front of Democracy against Dictatorship, also known as the &ldquo;red-shirts&rdquo;, and have been underway since 13 March.  The &ldquo;red-shirts&rdquo; are supporters of the former Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted after a military coup in September 2006.  They regard the current Government as illegitimate and have called for the dissolution of Parliament and for new elections.  Following negotiations between the Government and protesters earlier this month, it appeared that a compromise between the parties had been reached, with Prime Minister Abhisit proposing a &ldquo;reconciliation plan&rdquo; and offering to hold elections in November.</P>
        <P>However, the Prime Minister&rsquo;s offer was conditional on the protesters ending their occupation of the main shopping district in Bangkok.  For their part, the protesters vowed to remain in the encampment until the Prime Minister set a specific date for dissolving Parliament.  With neither party prepared to compromise, the Government intervened to close the encampment.</P>
        <P>The EU recently expressed grave concern about the situation in Thailand, urging both sides in the conflict to negotiate and to solve the political crisis through peaceful and democratic means.  The &ldquo;red-shirts&rdquo; had appealed for EU observers to be sent to Thailand but the Thai Government had insisted that it had the situation under control and did not need external assistance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the question of raising this matter at the UN, I understand that consideration will be given over the coming weeks to the idea of raising it at the Human Rights Council in Geneva.  The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, has also been monitoring the situation carefully.  In a statement issued on 14 May, the Secretary-General stated that he was following developments in Thailand with growing concern and that he was saddened by the reports of numerous civilian deaths, including journalists, as a result of clashes between protesters and security forces.  He appealed both to the protesters and the Thai authorities to do all within their power to avoid <Col N="252"/>further violence and loss of life.   He has encouraged them to return urgently to dialogue in order to de-escalate the situation and resolve matters peacefully.</P>
        <P>I share the views of the Secretary-General.  Replying to a Parliamentary Question on 30 March, I welcomed talks which had taken place between the Prime Minister and the &ldquo;red-shirt&rdquo; protesters and I expressed the hope that these talks would lay the foundation for broader dialogue on the range of issues which divide Thailand.  I remain of the view that, if political stability is to be achieved and if Thailand is to successfully address the many challenges it faces, the parties there must engage in dialogue and work with each other in a spirit of peaceful, national reconciliation.  The Government believes that the crisis can only be resolved through peaceful and democratic means.  Together with our EU partners, we will do all in our power to promote this outcome.</P>

It is the stated position of the Colombian Government that it will not negotiate with the FARC or the ELN until they lay down arms, inter alia, in accordance with the Justice and Peace Law, 2005, of which the AUC and a number of individual FARC and ELN members have availed.  Presidential elections will take place on 30 May in Colombia.  I cannot anticipate any change in policy that might occur following these elections.</P>

Over the past three months there has been <Col N="253"/>frequent contact between Irish officials and the UAE authorities, representatives from other countries whose passports were also used in this incident and representatives of the Israeli Government.  On 22 February, I met with Israeli Foreign Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, in Brussels to outline how seriously we take the misuse of Irish passports.  The Irish Ambassador in Tel Aviv also met with the Europe Director of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and registered our serious concerns.  The Israeli Ambassador was invited to Iveagh House where senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs stressed the seriousness with which the Government viewed the matter. In our discussions with the Israeli authorities, we have requested them to give us any information they may have on the use of forged Irish passports. To date, we have not received a reply.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>At 21 May, 2010 there were 62,944 applications in the system.  My Department has obtained the necessary sanction to recruit 50 temporary staff and arrangements have been made for staff to commence work at short notice. If necessary, we are prepared to recruit additional staff.</P>
        <P>These arrears are a direct result of the ongoing industrial action by the Civil Public and Services Union (CPSU).   It is presently taking up to twenty five working days to process individual applications submitted through the Passport Express Service, the Northern Ireland Passport Express Service and at the counters in the Passport Office. Applications submitted through ordinary post are taking up to eight weeks to process. Applications, other than those that are prioritised on the basis of demonstrable urgent humanitarian need, are being processed on a first come first served basis.</P>
        <P>The dispute is having a severe impact on the travelling public.  There are very many Irish citizens whose trips abroad have had to be cancelled and holiday and work plans severely disrupted.  Every effort is being made to reduce the waiting time for applications, pending the resolution of the industrial action.  Staff have been working overtime for some weeks and this has kept the level of increase in the backlog to a minimum and in recent days seen a marginal reduction in the backlog.</P>
        <P>However, the backlog in passport applications can and will be overcome when the CPSU call off their industrial action and co-operate with the recruitment of temporary staff normally engaged at this time of year.  I would once again call on the CPSU to withdraw this restriction and to allow a significant number of currently unemployed workers to take on paid employment and assist in reducing the sizeable backlog of passport applications.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the bilateral or other arrangements that have been discussed between his Department and its counterpart in the United States in respect of the undocumented Irish in the United States in the past 12 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[21959/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The difficult situation of the undocumented Irish in the US and the impact on their families in America and Ireland is a matter of deep concern to the Government. I would urge anybody who might be tempted in the current economic climate to follow in the footsteps of the undocumented to take account of the plight in which they now find themselves. Finding a solution for our undocumented citizens in the United States continues to be a Government priority. We are also committed to enhancing our bilateral migration arrangements with the US through the establishment of a reciprocal two year renewable visa scheme, known as the E3 visa, and the further development of the recently agreed working holiday programme.</P>
        <P>Over the last 12 months my Department, and the Embassy in Washington in particular, has worked proactively with the US Administration and Congressional leaders to achieve positive progress on this important issue. The status of the undocumented can only be changed by virtue of legislation passed by both Houses of Congress in the US &mdash; it is not merely a matter of bilateral engagement between the two Governments.</P><Col N="258"/>
        <P>During my visit to Washington and New York in October 2009, I held extensive discussions on the prospect for progress on immigration reform with a significant number of key Democrats and Republicans in Congress. These included the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy, Senator John McCain, Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Senator Chris Dodd, Senator Bob Casey, the Chair of the House Sub Committee on Immigration, Zoe Lofgren and the members of the House of Representatives Friends of Ireland Group. I also discuss the matter on a regular basis with Ambassador Rooney. It has been made clear to us that the undocumented can only be provided for through comprehensive immigration reform.</P>
        <P>During our St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit Washington this year, the Taoiseach and I took the opportunity to discuss immigration reform and the undocumented Irish in our meetings with President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and leading members of Congress. As part of his St Patrick&rsquo;s Day address, President Obama offered an assurance that his own commitment to comprehensive immigration reform remains unwavering.  President Obama has since reiterated this commitment to immigration reform, and has welcomed what he has described as the &ldquo;strong proposal&rdquo; for reform presented at the end of April by senior Democratic Senators Harry Reid, Charles Schumer, and Robert Menendez . This proposal includes provision for a path towards legalisation for the undocumented, including the Irish, provided they first admit to having violated US laws, undertake the repayment of taxes and perform community service. This outline legislation also specifically mentions an E-3 visa arrangement for Irish citizens. Although the proposal is only the first step in a long process, the inclusion of an Irish E3 scheme at this initial stage is an important achievement for the Government and the Irish community.</P>
        <P>While I am encouraged by these developments and also by the efforts which continue to be made on Capitol Hill to resolve this issue, very considerable political challenges remain, particularly in an election year. The Government will continue to maintain very close contact with the US Administration and Congress, as well as with Irish community advocates, to address this issue in the period ahead. Through the Emigrant Support Programme, we have provided $285,000 to the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, since 2006, to assist with their lobbying efforts. In 2009, we also provided $10,000 to the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform.</P>

While the general principles set out in the document provided are entirely laudable, the National Council of Resistance of Iran is generally regarded as the political wing of the People&rsquo;s Mujahideen of Iran, an emigr&eacute; group with little support in Iran and a very questionable history.

	<P>The schemes operated by my Department which support community based art and sport related proposals throughout the country are the ACCESS Programme, the Sports Capital Programme and the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  Under the ACCESS programme, my Department is responsible for the provision of capital monies for arts centres, galleries, theatres, etc.  In 2008 and 2009 &euro;52m was expended in respect of such facilities.  A further &euro;16m is allocated in 2010 for regional arts capital projects throughout the country.  Many of these projects are already under construction and will be completed in 2010.  A list of the successful ACCESS II projects and the amount of grant aid allocated to each project is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  No date has been set for the next round of allocations under the ACCESS programme.</P>
        <P>Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, and part funded from the proceeds of the National Lottery, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. Given the current budgetary situation and the high level of outstanding commitments it was considered prudent to pause prior to announcing the next round of the Programme and no date has been set for the next round of the Programme.<i>  </i>Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme grant aid to a maximum of &euro;3.8m is provided to Local Authorities towards the capital cost of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools. No decision has been taken on the timing of a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The surplus amounts surrendered by my Department to the Department of Finance and the departmental budgets for each year 2007 to 2009 are outlined in the following table. A detailed breakdown of the figures for 2007 and 2008 is published in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Audit of Appropriation Accounts for each year. The Appropriation Accounts also contain an explanation of the variances between the outturn figure and the estimate provision under various expenditure subheads.</P>
        <P>In relation to the projects for which the surrendered funds were originally earmarked, the capital grant schemes in my Department are demand-led and depend on projects progressing to a satisfactory level to allow payment of funding.   Accordingly, the funds allocated are not specifically earmarked for payment to a specific project in a given year and depend on the progress of the project.  In relation to other capital projects, the Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with Section 91 of the Finance Act 2004, capital monies unspent in a particular year can be carried forward to be spent in the following year, subject to Department of Finance approval and certain limits.  This deferred expenditure was applied to some unspent capital monies in 2007 and 2008, as approved by the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amounts of deferred expenditure are shown in the following table and are also outlined in detail in the Appropriation Accounts and the Revised Estimates Volume for my Department&rsquo;s Vote for each year. The remaining unspent amounts surrendered to the Department of Finance in 2007 and 2008 relate to current expenditure savings.  Other than a small amount of capital expenditure in the administrative budget, all of the savings in 2009 relate to current expenditure, including administrative budget savings, pay savings and other efficiency savings.</P>

	<P>Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations for the capital costs of providing sports facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  The organisation in question was awarded grants under the 2006 and 2007 Sports Capital Programme of &euro;175,000 and &euro;70,000 respectively.  The organisation also received a RAPID top-up in 2006 of &euro;52,500.  The grant allocation was subject to the terms and conditions of the Programme, which includes the execution of a deed of covenant and charge.  A deed of covenant and charge provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s legal adviser, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office &mdash; CSSO &mdash; deals with the grantee&rsquo;s solicitor in ensuring that these issues are satisfactorily resolved before grants can be paid. The current position is that the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office is awaiting paper work from the grantees solicitor. When this is received and if all matters are in order, the grant can then be paid.</P>

        <Quest> if the vessel <i>MV Stenland</i> has been sold; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this vessel was Lasta Mara Teo&rsquo;s back-up vessel for the island subsidy; the vessel that is now acting as back-up vessel; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Lasta Mara Teo has a contract with my Department to provide a cargo service to the Aran Islands for the 5-year period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012, using the vessels &lsquo;Bl&aacute;th na Mara&rsquo; and &lsquo;Madelen&rsquo; as main vessels.  Under the terms of the contract, the company is also required to maintain access to a back-up vessel registered under the name &lsquo;Stenland&rsquo; or an equivalent type vessel, to be of a standard approved by the Minister for use when either of the main vessels may be unavailable to provide the service.</P>
        <P>My Department has agreed to Lasta Mara&rsquo;s request to nominate the &lsquo;Madelen&rsquo; as back-up vessel as the company wished to avail of an opportunity to sell the &lsquo;Stenland.&rsquo;  In agreeing to this alteration to the terms of the contract, regard was had to the satisfactory service being provided by the company, the very few occasions on which the &lsquo;Stenland&rsquo; was actually required as the back-up vessel and an assurance from the company that another vessel that it has acquired will also be available for the service, if the need arises.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Funding provided to the statutory agencies under the remit of my Department is shown in the Revised Estimates <Col N="263"/>each year and in the Appropriation Accounts, each of which are available in the D&aacute;il library and on the internet at www.finance.gov.ie and www.audgen.gov.ie respectively.  In the following table, the funding provided to the agencies in 2007 and 2008 is taken from the outturns shown in the Appropriation Accounts.  The Appropriation Accounts for 2009 are not yet published.  Accordingly, the figures used for 2009 are the provisional outturns shown in the Revised Estimates.  In the case of 2010 the figures used are the allocations shown in the Revised Estimates.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s annual estimates and provisional outturns are published in the Revised Estimates Volumes, which are available at www.finance.gov.ie.  The final outturns are published in the Appropriation Accounts, which are available at www.audgen.gov.ie.  Both publications are also available in the D&aacute;il library.</P>
        <P>In the table below, the relevant details, including the total estimate and the surplus to be surrendered, are taken from the Appropriation Accounts for 2007 and 2008 &mdash; the latest years in respect of which published Appropriation Accounts are available.  The estimates for 2009 and 2010 are taken from the Revised Estimates Volume.  The audit of the Appropriation Account for 2009 has not yet been completed and, accordingly, the expenditure shown is the provisional outturn; the final figure for the surplus to be surrendered to the Exchequer is not yet available.  As the Deputy is aware, the estimates and expenditure are made up of various subheads.  The overall surplus to be surrendered comprises the sum of the variations across subheads and therefore does not relate back to specific projects.  However, all major variations in subheads, as between estimates and outturn, are explained in the Appropriation Accounts.</P><Col N="268"/>

	<P>Funding under the CL&Aacute;R Programme for the projects referred to by the Deputy was approved in August 2008. In line with the normal arrangements that apply, it is a matter for the applicant to subsequently draw down the funding based on progress in completing the works.

The balance of the funding will be provided when claimed validly by the applicant, in line with the conditions of the original approval.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> the action he is taking to alleviate the impact of the carbon tax on lower income households; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Social Protection already assists low income households with heating costs through their basic payments, through the fuel allowance scheme and through the household benefits package of electricity and gas allowances. These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.  The fuel allowance is paid for 32 weeks each year from end September to end April. In the 2009/2010 heating season over 340,000 recipients benefited from the allowance at a cost of over &euro;231million. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Some 376,000 pensioners are receiving the household benefits which provides 2,400 electricity units per annum (or the gas equivalent) over the year and it is estimated that some 140,000 of these households are receiving both fuel allowance and the electricity units /gas allowance <Col N="270"/>under the household benefits to assist with the heating and other energy requirements. The household benefit package cost &euro;184 million in 2009.</P>
        <P>Proper household insulation is absolutely vital in tacking fuel poverty. Initiatives such as the Warmer Homes Scheme, operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have a very valuable role to play in that regard, as does funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to improve the quality of existing local authority housing and the Housing Adaptation Grants for older people and people with disabilities. Considerable progress has been made in this area in recent years.  In his Carbon Budget Statement, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, outlined details of &euro;130 million in funding for insulation, &euro;76 million of which will be used to assist low income families.</P>
        <P>The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio and has convened an Inter-Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy to coordinate and drive Government policy in this area.  The Inter Departmental/Agency Group has been asked to draw up an Energy Affordability Strategy.  This strategy will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability and will have regard both to the impact of the carbon tax on low income households and the range of supports outlined above in making its recommendations.  As part of its work, the Group will make recommendations as to the precise package of measures, including in the area of income support, that should be put in place to assist those at risk of fuel poverty.</P>

	<P>There are currently just over 16,500 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, compared to 8,091 recipients in 2008. Expenditure for the year ending December 2009 was &euro;60.7m; the estimate for 2010 is &euro;63.9m.  The mortgage interest supplement scheme is currently under review. The main purpose of this review is to examine how the scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis. The review group includes representatives from my Department, the Community Welfare Service, the Departments of Finance and Environment, Heritage and Local Government, together with a representative from the Office of the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As part of the initial review, guidelines on specific and immediate operational issues were drawn up and circulated to the community welfare officers. These guidelines are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.welfare.ie</i>.  The group is examining trends in programme and administrative costs, the impact of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s statutory Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears and legislative and operational issues arising, including the cap on hours of employment.  The review is also considering whether alternative approaches to achieving the scheme&rsquo;s objectives are warranted in the light of recent changes in the economic climate and the mortgage market.</P>
        <P>More recently, the Government has established a broader and more comprehensive review of mortgage arrears and personal debt. The Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney, comprises representatives from my own Department, the Departments of Finance, Taoiseach, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  In addition the Group has representatives from the Office of the Financial <Col N="271"/>Regulator, the ESRI, the Irish Banking Federation, the Free Legal Advice Centre and the Law Reform Commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The terms of reference for the Group are based on the Renewed Programme for Government, with an emphasis on protecting the family home. They include a review of the statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the recently agreed protocol between the Irish Bankers Federation and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service on debt default, with a view to expanding the options available for dealing with debt situations to avoid foreclosure. In addition, the Group is examining measures adopted in other jurisdictions and considering ways of expanding existing mortgage-support measures. I understand that the Group will make its report to the Minister for Finance by the end of June.  The conclusions and recommendations from the review of the mortgage interest supplement scheme, which is currently being finalised, will inform the work of this group.</P>

	<P>There are currently 19 jobseekers categorised as availing of the IBEC Gradlink programme.

	<P>The fuel allowance scheme is intended to help households who are dependent on long-term social welfare payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  Entitlement to the allowance is based on a household income test.  If, in addition to their pension from the Department, the applicant or members of his/her household have a combined income of more than &euro;100.00 per week, or savings/investments of more than &euro;58,000, a fuel allowance is not payable.  According to the information available to the Department, the person is in receipt of a private pension in excess of &euro;100.00 per week.  Consequently, he is not entitled to a fuel allowance.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 300 and 301 together.</P>
        <P>The European Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) is the main data source for measuring poverty and social exclusion in Ireland. Consistent poverty is the official measurement of poverty in Ireland which measures the percentage of persons below 60 per cent of average income, who are also deprived of goods and services regarded as essential for living in Ireland today, as measured by deprivation indicators. The most recent figures for 2008 show that the level of consistent poverty in Ireland is 4.2 per cent but older people living alone are 4 times less likely to experience consistent poverty than the general population.  The level of consistent poverty among older people living alone fell dramatically from 4.1 per cent in 2007 to 0.9 per cent in 2008.  Similarly older people living alone were much less likely than the general population to be at risk of poverty using only income as the measure (11 per cent vs. 14.4 per cent).</P>
        <P>These reductions represent the success of Government policy in relation to supporting older people.  The priority has been to increase personal rates of pension in addition to enhancing the household benefits package which includes TV licence, telephone, electricity/gas and the fuel allowance rather than supplements like the living alone increase.  The objective is to use resources to improve the position of all pensioners to the fullest extent possible rather than <Col N="274"/>focusing on particular groups.   The living alone increase is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living  alone and receiving payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes.</P>
        <P>The living alone increase is primarily a benefit for aged 66 or over. Accordingly, there are no plans to extend the payment to people receiving other social welfare payments.    In addition, some schemes by their nature could not attract a living alone increase as individuals living alone cannot qualify.  This would apply to the one-parent family payment which requires that a child must live with the recipient.  My Department does not have information available on the living arrangements of individuals on social welfare payments other than those who are in receipt of living alone increase and accordingly it is not possible to cost the proposal outlined by the Deputy.</P>

        <Quest> if a person (details supplied) in County Mayo has sufficient contributions to qualify for a State contributory pension on reaching 66 years; if not, if they can make voluntary contributions until they reach the age of 66 years in order to qualify for the State contributory pension. </Quest>

	<P>The Department, to help people assess their position regarding possible future pension entitlements, issues to them a copy of their contribution history record and a &lsquo;Working it Out&rsquo; booklet which explains how entitlement to a State pension (contributory) is assessed. In order to be admitted as a voluntary contributor a person must:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have at least 260 weeks PRSI contributions paid while in employment or self-employment;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />apply to the Department within 12 months after the end of the contribution year during which they last paid compulsory PRSI or had a credited contribution;</P>

	<P>Payment of illness benefit, to the person concerned, was disallowed by a Deciding Officer following an examination by a Medical Assessor of the Department who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work. An appeal was opened and in the context of that appeal her case was reviewed by a second Medical Assessor who also expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, following receipt of the grounds of appeal from the person concerned, the relevant Departmental papers and comments of the Department have been sought. On receipt of its response the case will be referred to an Appeals Officer for consideration.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

	<P>The person concerned submitted an application for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance on 29 March 2010. The payment of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is subject to a means test and in this regard the file has been forwarded to a Social Welfare Inspector. I understand the Inspector interviewed the person concerned on 20 May 2010 and he has been asked to furnish additional documentation. The jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance file will be returned to a Deciding Officer for decision once the Inspector&rsquo;s report is complete.  A person may apply for supplementary welfare allowance from their local Community Welfare Officer while any application for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is being processed. </P>

A letter issued to the applicant on 19th May 2010 advising her of the decision to refuse payment. In the case of an application which is refused, the applicant may submit additional information and ask for the case to be reviewed and/or they may appeal the decision by writing to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  On the basis of the additional information supplied by the Deputy, the case will now be reviewed and the customer will be notified in writing of the decision. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 312 and 313 together. </P>
        <P>The Renewed Programme for Government, published in October 2009, contains a commitment to introduce legal recognition of the acquired gender of transsexuals. An interdepartmental committee has been established with the following terms of reference:-  &ldquo;To advise the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on the legislation required to provide for legal recognition by the State of the acquired gender of transsexuals. In particular to propose heads of a bill to provide for</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of a process for legal recognition of the acquired gender of persons suffering from Gender Identity Disorder who have made the transition from one gender to the other.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of a gender recognition register.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The granting of entitlement to transsexuals to marry in the legally recognised reassigned gender</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Any other provisions as may be deemed necessary consequent on the main provisions of the Bill&rdquo;.</P><Col N="281"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The committee is made up of representatives of various Departments and Offices of State and had its first meeting on Thursday, 6 May 2010. It is envisaged that the committee, as part of its deliberations, may invite submissions from interested groups, experts in the field and the public. I would expect that the committee will make its recommendations within a period of about 6 months. It is not possible at this early stage to say when the resulting proposals will be introduced in the legislative programme, or indeed, when a Bill will be introduced. I would, however, assure the Deputy that the matter will be treated as a priority by the Department when the deliberations of the committee are finalised.</P>
        <P>The position in relation to the Court proceedings referred to is that the matter is under appeal to the Supreme Court. In the circumstances, it is not appropriate for me to comment further.</P>

        <P el="5">2009 &mdash; 1,681;</P>
       <P el="5">2010 &mdash; 1,751 (at mid May).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The farm assist scheme which was introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 1999 is a practical response by the Department to the situation of low-income farmers and it represents a long-term safety net for them. It benefits farm families with children and also provides increased payments to farming couples without children and to single farmers on low income.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Almost all expenditure of the Department of Social Protection is incurred on scheme payments to individual recipients such as pensioners and jobseekers based on pre-determined qualifying conditions and rates of payment, generally set out in legislation.  The expenditure, which is demand-led, is driven by economic, social and demographic factors and the under-spends in the years in question are primarily due to these factors.</P>

	<P>Between defined contribution and defined benefit schemes, there were more than 850,000 pension scheme members in 2008.  Excluding some 300,000 public sector members, that means that more than 500,000 private sector employees are members of occupational pension schemes.  There is no compulsion on private sector employees to join an occupational pension scheme.  Any decision to do so is usually theirs to take.  One possible exception is where an employer insists on membership of their occupational pension scheme as part of a person&rsquo;s terms of employment.  However, there is no data on the numbers of employers, schemes or employees that this may impact upon.  The vast majority of public sector workers are automatically enrolled into a pension scheme on commencement of employment.</P>

        <Quest> the steps he has taken to date or proposes to take to ensure that every effort is made to meet the requirements of those who have become unemployed and who find themselves with mortgage and other domestic commitments well in excess of anything likely to be manageable in their circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>People who are unemployed and unable to meet their mortgage commitments may be entitled under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to receive a supplement in respect of their mortgage interest.  The scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive (HSE) on behalf of the Department.  The purpose of mortgage interest supplement is to provide short term support to enable people to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. </P>
        <P>Each application for mortgage interest supplement is determined by a community welfare officer taking account of the relevant legislative provisions and on the basis of the merits of each individual case.  In addition, the HSE may make a single exceptional needs payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment.  There is no automatic entitlement to such payments. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the HSE.</P>
        <P>People who are experiencing difficulties in meeting their mortgage repayments or other household bills should immediately contact their finance agency or the relevant utility company to discuss arrangements to address their issues.  They should also contact the money advice and budgeting service (MABS) which provides assistance for people with financial difficulties.  The service operates from 65 locations throughout the country and can be contacted either through a national telephone helpline or a website. The Government is providing over &euro;18 million this year to the MABS to enable them to assist people with managing their finances and coping with debt problems.</P>

	<P>The statistics requested by the Deputy are given in the accompanying table.  A number of initiatives are currently underway designed to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard, 2 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009.  A number of additional staff are being assigned to the administration area of the Office.  The organisation of the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s work has been changed so as to increase productivity.  A project to improve the business processes in the office is underway and a number of improvements have already been implemented.  Significant enhancements are being made to the Office&rsquo;s IT and phone systems.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these measures, it is clear that further additional staff will be required in the short term to address the backlog that has developed.  Any such staff must be very experienced and be in a position to operate without significant training.  Therefore it has been decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources.  </P>

	<P>The Department is committed to ensuring that claims are processed as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.  Over the past number of years a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in the pension scheme area in Sligo.  Significant improvements have been achieved in claim processing times and backlogs have been eliminated.  Operational processes and procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.</P>
        <P>From January 2009, new processing targets, based on processing 90% of claims, were introduced for all schemes.  The processing targets and average performance achieved for the period May 2009 to April 2010 in respect of State Pension Contributory (SPC) and State Pension Non Contributory (SPNC) and State Pension Transition (SPT) are outlined below.</P>

	<P>Within the available resources, the Government is committed to maintaining the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at a level of 10,000 all ranks, for which Government approval has been secured in the context of Budget 2010.  This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as at 30 April 2010 was 9,856 comprising 8,036 Army, 797 Air Corps and 1,023 Naval Service personnel.  As the Deputy will be aware I have recently approved the recruitment of 40 Recruits for the Naval Service.  The recruitment competition for the Naval Service commenced on Friday 14 May 2010 and will close on Friday 4 June 2010.  Further recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force along with issues relating to promotions and acting appointments are kept under ongoing review.</P>
        <P>I intend, with the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles while contributing to the necessary public service economies.  I am advised that at this time the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government at home and overseas.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Air Corps provides an aerial photographic service for the Defence Forces.  Photographs produced at the request of the military authorities were done so for security or Air Corps operational reasons.  They were never produced or categorised with a view to making them available to the public.  In the past, the Air Corps provided an aerial photographic service to Ordnance Survey Ireland.  This arrangement is now discontinued but Ordnance Survey Ireland may be able to provide information on the photographs retained by it.  There are no plans in place to commence a project to publish the aerial photographs held by the Defence Forces.  Aside from security issues involved, it would require significant expenditure of manpower and resources which could not be justified in the current circumstances.</P>

Payment does not fall due until two months after the liability date and there is a further one month&rsquo;s grace period before penalties for late payment commence.

	<P>The Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009 provide the statutory framework for combating litter pollution in Ireland. Section 6 of the 1997 Act places an onus on owners and occupiers of property to keep their properties litter free to the extent that they are public places or are visible from a public place. Section 9 of the same Act empowers local authorities to serve a notice on any person contravening the provisions of Section 6, requiring them to remove any litter to which the contravention relates, and/or to take any precautionary measures which the local authority considers necessary.</P>
        <P>Penalties for offences under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009 are substantial, ranging from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment. The fines for continuing offences following conviction are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences.  A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the Courts to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence, taking remedial action to remove the litter and in bringing the prosecution.  I have no current plans to increase the level of fines for litter related offences.</P>

        <P>Section 254 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for a licensing system for the placement of various structures and appliances on, under, over or along a public road, including maps for indicating directions or places.  This licensing system enables a local authority to exercise control over the placing of structures on roads to prevent traffic hazards arising.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development Regulations, 2001 prescribe the level of fees to be charged in respect of structures and appliances licensed under Section 254 of the 2000 Act.   The Regulations prescribe a fee of &euro;630 for an advertisement structure or &euro;50 in the case of an advertisement structure that is of a fingerpost type, not exceeding 1 metre in length, consisting of a direction sign to indicate tourist accommodation.  Consideration is being given in my Department to reviewing this matter and the associated fees, in consultation with planning authorities.</P>

	<P>When an application for a motor vehicle licence is received, motor taxation authorities are required by law to satisfy themselves that the tax disc for which the application is made is the appropriate disc for the vehicle in question.  In the case of a commercial vehicle, the applicant must complete a statutory declaration, produce a weight docket if the vehicle is under a certain weight, provide evidence of commercial insurance and provide a roadworthiness certificate if the vehicle is over one year old.  Evidence of registration for VAT is not routinely sought.  There is no prohibition in the motor tax code in regard to the carrying of work tools in a vehicle which has been taxed privately.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 345 to 348, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="295"/>
        <P>A comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure has been approved for County Galway in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The total value of contracts underway and those proposed for commencement during the period of the Programme in County Galway is &euro;130 million.  The Programme provides for the commencement of contracts relating to the Claregalway, Clifden and Oughterard Sewerage Schemes, while work on the Barna Sewerage Scheme is substantially completed.  My Department is currently examining the contract documents for the combined Claregalway and Milltown Sewerage Scheme and a decision on those documents will be conveyed to Galway County Council as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Further progress on the Clifden Sewerage Scheme must await the Council&rsquo;s response to my Department&rsquo;s request in March 2010 to review the contract documents and to submit a Certificate of Completion of Planning for the scheme.  In relation to the Oughterard Sewerage Scheme, the Council has appointed consultants to prepare a Design Review Report so as to ensure that the most suitable and effective scheme is put forward.  Once the Report is submitted and approved by my Department, the Council can then proceed with the preparation of contract documents for the scheme.</P>

Owners of second properties would not normally be in a category of persons for whom a waiver scheme would generally be necessary or appropriate, and the charge is relatively modest.  The Act places collection of the charge under the care and management of the relevant local authority.</P>

	<P>My Department issued a circular to housing authorities in early <Col N="296"/>April 2010 setting out revised arrangements for the funding of land used for social housing and seeking information on local authority residential land holdings for the purpose of land-use strategy planning.  This circular invites authorities to apply to my Department to recoup the cost of outstanding loans on the land where these loans are due to mature before the end of 2010 and where it is considered that the land is unlikely to be developed in the short to medium term. Subject to available funding my Department may pay off the costs of the land and transfer ownership to a central agency. These lands will continue to be available for social housing if housing projects are advanced by authorities under the Social Housing Investment Programme.</P>
        <P>There is no proposal to transfer lands or loans currently held by local authorities to the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). However, it is intended that my Department will work closely with NAMA in the interests of proper planning and to secure best use of public land.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 356 to 358, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grant schemes, introduced in November 2007, are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  The new suite of grants <Col N="298"/>replaced the discontinued Disabled Persons Grant Scheme, the Essential Repairs Grant Scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme, administered by the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed to each of the various grant measures from within the allocations notified to them by my Department and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within their allocation.  Details of the annual Exchequer allocations to Clare County Council and the number of grants paid under each scheme for the period 2005 to 2009 are set out in the table below. Data for 2005 and 2006 relate to the discontinued Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes.  Data for 2007 onwards include the new Housing Adaptation Grant Scheme for People with a Disability, the Housing Aid for Older People and the Mobility Aids Grant Schemes.</P>

My Department has met with a broad range of interested parties in regard to the shape that such a register might take, and recommendations arising from this process will be made to Government shortly.  The timing of the establishment of the register will be determined by a range of factors including the possible need for amendment of the Data Protection Acts to allow for publication of achieved sales prices.</P>

	<P>The National Waste Prevention Programme (NWPP) was established in April 2004 in accordance with the policy document Preventing and Recycling Waste &mdash; Delivering Change.  Implementation of the Programme is a matter for the EPA.  A National Waste Prevention Committee (NWPC), which includes a broad stakeholder group including governmental, non-governmental, business and sectoral interests, was also established to provide strategic direction for the EPA in implementing the Programme.  The aim is to deliver substantive results on waste prevention and minimisation and integrate a range of initiatives addressing awareness-raising, technical and financial assistance, training and incentive mechanisms.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the EPA published a new Prevention Plan 2009-2012 which is a framework statement of intent for work to be completed, subject to resources, on the Prevention Programme for the four-year period to 2012.  A key part of the plan is the marketing and promotion of prevention opportunities available to all organisations and householders.  The Programme will be resourced as necessary to reduce the volume of waste and with a view to building on its success to <Col N="302"/>date.  In particular, in accordance with the importance attributed to prevention in the Waste Framework Directive, my Department will work with the EPA and all relevant stakeholders to deliver an effective programme which supports those homes and businesses which seek to reduce their production of residual waste.</P>
        <P>The Department will also work with the EPA on the development of a National Food Waste Prevention Programme, as outlined in the renewed Programme for Government.  The EPA&rsquo;s website contains a list of useful resources in relation to food waste such as the &ldquo;Less Food Waste&rdquo; booklet, with advice on preventing food waste in the catering sector, &ldquo;Calling Time on Waste&rdquo; booklet, with advice on preventing food waste in pubs, and the &ldquo;Stopfoodwaste.ie&rdquo; website with tips on food waste prevention in the home and home composting.</P>

	<P>Ireland is making significant progress in ensuring that these directives are correctly implemented.  Since coming into office, I have placed a high priority on addressing the implications of a number of adverse findings against Ireland by the European Court of Justice.  My Department is at present preparing substantial legislative measures to deal with transposition deficiencies that have been identified.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 and amended European Communities (Birds and Habitats) Regulations will ensure legal clarity in regard to obligations under these directives in respect of a range of consent processes.</P>
        <P>In addition, a comprehensive designation programme of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs) undertaken by my Department is almost complete and will address concerns of the Court that Ireland had not correctly identified and protected these sites.  Thirdly, measures are being taken to ensure that particular pressures on protected birds, species and habitats are addressed in terms of regulation and practice.  These include a wide range of activities, including but not limited to aquaculture and fishery licensing, forestry consents, agricultural practices in certain areas, recreational activities in certain areas, turf-cutting on designated sites and arterial drainage.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 369 and 370 together.</P>
        <P>Mink found in the wild in Ireland are descended from animals that escaped from fur farms.  They have been breeding in the wild since the 1950s and are now found throughout the country.  A report published by my Department in 2009 estimated that the potential population of wild <Col N="303"/>mink in the State was between 20,500 and 33,500 individuals.  The report also identified ground nesting birds as the wild species most vulnerable to mink predation.  Accordingly, my Department is concentrating its resources on protecting the nesting sites of rare and threatened bird species including red-throated divers, corncrakes, waders and terns from a range of predators including mink.  Experience has shown that targeted control of predators at specific times can have a significant benefit to the breeding success of these species.  This year some &euro;60,000 will be spent on this work.  As wild mink are not protected under the Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000 they can also be trapped freely by landowners and their agents.</P>

	<P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &mdash; 2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Clare.  While the Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some &euro;38 million in the county during the period of the Programme, it was not possible to include the Broadford Sewerage Scheme amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion.</P>
        <P>The new Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth as envisaged in the Government&rsquo;s policy document Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy &mdash; A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal.  A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Clare County Council, in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities.  Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time.</P>

        <Quest> the breakdown of the warmer homes scheme by geographical area; the number of applicants for each area in 2009 and to date in 2010; the waiting lists for each area; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), provides energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, fuel poverty.  The scheme is delivered using two modes of delivery, community based organisations (CBOs) of which 23 have been approved to date, and a panel of private contractors.  CBOs work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations including public health nurses, MABS and the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul to identify and address vulnerable homes.  Through this devolution model each CBO is responsible for managing the applications in their own operational areas.  SEAI is therefore not directly involved in the application process where CBOs are involved.  Private contractors were engaged on a pilot basis in 2009 to address the increasing demand for the scheme.  Through these mechanisms, the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) was delivered to 16,240 homes in 2009.  A further 2,886 homes received similar measures through the ESB&rsquo;s Home Insulation Scheme in 2009.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to report that the WHS is now available nationwide using a dual model of delivery with CBOs in their set geographical areas and private contractors extending the geographic reach of the programme while also providing deeper measures including central heating in certain homes.  The waiting time for the WHS varies, and is generally between 3 and 6 months.  SEAI with the combined use of CBOs and contractors is actively working towards reducing waiting time for the scheme, making it as accessible as possible to those in most need and providing a consistent delivery of the scheme nationwide.  More generally the Deputy may wish to note that a dedicated hot line &mdash; 1800 250 204 &mdash; has been in operation for some time and all queries, from scheme applicants and public representatives, on delivery dates for individual households and/or funding agreements are dealt with immediately.  In addition, the WHS programme manager, Mr. Michael Martin of the SEAI, is available to deal with queries on 042 <Col N="305"/>939 1548.  The availability of both points of contact ensures that there is no delay in dealing with specific queries related to the delivery of the WHS.</P>
        <P>The number and location of recipients of the WHS and the Home Insulation scheme in 2009 and the WHS to date in 2010 are as follows:  </P>

	<P>Neither area cited in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question has been designated for inclusion as part of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  Prior to the commencement of the NBS a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to help determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, were to be excluded.  EU State aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS <Col N="306"/>is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  That mapping exercise found a number of broadband suppliers were already active in the areas referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question and consequently the localities were excluded from the Scheme.  Details of broadband services available in each county, including county Sligo, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at<i> www.callcosts.ie.</i></P>

        <P FLI="0">EirGrid was not in a position to provide the monthly breakdown for 2006 but has advised that the annual consumption of electricity in 2006 was 27,920.4 gW hours (based on 52 weeks) where 1 gW hour is 1,000 Mega Watt hours.  EirGrid now publishes monthly electricity statistic reports on its website and this data, which includes details on monthly electricity demand, demand growth, peak demand and installed generation capacity, is readily accessible in respect of the months from July 2009 onwards.</P>
        <P>EirGrid also publishes an annual Generation Adequacy Report, which sets out estimates of the demand for electricity in the following 7-year period, the likely production capacity that will be in place to meet this demand, and assesses the consequences in terms of the overall supply/demand balance.  In its most recent Generation Adequacy Report for the period 2010 to 2016, EirGrid highlighted that the change in the economic climate since 2008 has been <Col N="308"/>reflected in a reduction in electricity demand.  It also noted that this reduction in demand, coupled with the connection of new generation, improved generator availability, and increased interconnection, means that there is adequate capacity to meet demand in accordance with system standards over the next seven years.</P>

        <Quest> the steps required to give effect to the new Article 27a on 116 numbers in Directive 2002/22/EC which requires member states to make every effort to ensure that citizens have access to a service operating a hotline to report cases of missing children and when he intends to stop delaying and deliver on this. </Quest>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 380 and 381 together.</P>
        <P>The European Commission published a Commission Decision dated the 15th February 2007 entitled &ldquo;Reserving the national numbering range beginning with &ldquo;116&rdquo; for harmonised numbers for harmonised services of social value&rdquo;.  Directive 2009/136/EC which amends Directive 2002/22/EC deals with the promotion of specific numbers in the &ldquo;116&rdquo; range and the encouragement of services for which such numbers are reserved.  The allocation of specific numbers in the 116 number range in Ireland is managed by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which published (July 2007) and advertised (November 2007) the existence of the number range and invited suitable applicants to apply for the setting up of services.</P>
        <P>I am advised by ComReg that Childline commenced a service using the telephone number 116111 in April 2009 and that the number 116123 has been allocated to the Samaritans.  It is open to other organisations to apply to ComReg for the allocation of additional numbers from this numbering range.  I am informed by ComReg that no organisation has yet applied for the missing children hotline number 116000.  More generally, I would expect that cases of missing children would be reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the normal way.</P>

	<P>An application under the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) was received from the individual in question on 1st February 2010.  At that time the service was not available in the area in which the individual lives, however, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) now informs me that the WHS has recently been expanded to cover the entire country and it is hoped to deliver the service to the named individual within the next two months.  More generally the Deputy may wish to note that a dedicated Warmer Homes Scheme hot line &mdash; 1800 250 204 &mdash; has been in operation for some time and all queries, from scheme applicants and public representatives, on delivery dates for individual households and/or funding agreements are dealt with immediately.  In addition, the WHS programme manager, Mr. Michael Martin of SEAI, is available to deal with queries on 042 939 1548.  The availability of both points of contact ensures that there is no delay in dealing with specific queries related to the delivery of the WHS.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I understand that the Central Fisheries Board has also undertaken works on the three rivers but does not have the figure for its total spend to hand.  I have asked the Board to forward this information to you directly.  I have been informed by the Southern Regional Fisheries Board that there is no counter on the River Barrow.  However, the Board did operate a temporary counter on a tributary of the river for a short period during 2009 as part of an educational project.  The performance of all salmon rivers is assessed by the Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) using a standard methodology.  Fish counters represent only one of the methods by which salmon stock levels are assessed.  In calculating the estimated salmon run, reliance is also placed by the Committee on catch data and surveys by the Boards&rsquo; staff of spawning beds, fish populations and habitats, as well as juvenile electro-fishing results.</P>
        <P>The Committee sets out how the required number of salmon to maintain good stock status in the catchment is calculated in their annual report.  The number of fish above this conservation limit is available as a surplus for exploitation.  Further details on individual catchments are set out in the Committee&rsquo;s most recent report at <i>www.dcenr.gov.ie.</i> The Committee estimates that the Barrow (including Pollmounty waters) will only reach 40% of its conservation limit in 2010.</P>

        <Quest> the reforms to the Common Fisheries Policy that he has made in order to pursue Ireland&rsquo;s interests and in keeping with the renewed programme for Government 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The current review of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) was initiated by the European Commission when it issued a Green Paper in April 2009 and sought responses to the proposals it contained.  Minister Killeen, who had responsibility for the Fisheries portfolio at that time, appointed Dr. Noel Cawley to chair a nationwide public consultation process.  The result of these extensive consultations contributed in no small way to Ireland&rsquo;s Response to the Green Paper which issued on the 23rd of February.  The report in its entirety, and all formal submissions received during the public consultation process, are available on www.fishingnet.ie. </P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s response on the CFP reform sets down a number of informed recommendations which we believe must be incorporated into the new Common Fisheries Policy.  They take a pragmatic approach, promoting measures that collectively take account of economic, social, environmental and sustainability factors important to the Irish seafood sector.  The changes we consider necessary include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />New focus on addressing discarding of fish at sea with a complete ban being introduced for stocks in a depleted state;</P><Col N="317"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The retention of a management system based on national quotas supported by increased flexibility and a rejection of the mandatory privatisation of fish quotas or the introduction of international trading of fish quotas;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Access to coastal waters to be re-examined with a view to an extension of the coastal limit to 20 miles with new management arrangements in place to strengthen coastal communities dependant on inshore coastal fisheries;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />New measures to strengthen the market for EU producers and increase quay side prices;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Reinvigoration of European aquaculture with continued structural support and a roadmap that establishes a route for growth in harmony with Community environmental law;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />New regional structure to decision-making at EU level, with increasing industry responsibility and the development of a culture of compliance.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Consultation at European level on the review is ongoing, with a variety of meetings being held, including a stakeholders&rsquo; conference and an informal meeting of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers to discuss the reform, both of which were held in Spain at the start of May.  In addition, I attended a bilateral meeting with the Maria Damanaki, the new EU Commissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, in March 2010.  This meeting was arranged at my request to discuss Ireland&rsquo;s Response to the Commission&rsquo;s Green Paper.</P>
        <P>At this meeting we discussed many areas where we have common ground with the EU Commission. However, I made it quite clear that Ireland does not support the Commission&rsquo;s ideas expressed in the Green Paper which would allow our national fish quotas to be privatised and traded away to large European fishing companies.  I stressed that one of Ireland&rsquo;s main objective in the Reform Process will be to protect the national fish quotas as a public resource to be used for the benefit of our family owned fleet and to support our coastal communities.  Under the planned EU timetable for the review, a summary of the consultation process will be published in 2010.  It will be followed by a legislative proposal to the Council and the European Parliament to be adopted in 2011, with a view to its entering into force in 2012.  A working document concerning reform options is being prepared by the Commission and is expected to be presented at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council scheduled for the 28th and 29th June 2010.</P>
        <P>Nationally, I intend to continue close collaboration with the Federation of Irish Fishermen and the other stakeholders to put Ireland&rsquo;s case forward during the review, to vigorously defend Ireland&rsquo;s maritime interests, and to convince our colleagues in other Member States and in the Commission to strengthen the current policy in line with Ireland&rsquo;s submission on the reform of the CFP.</P>

	<P>There has been significant interest in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme since it opened for applications on 30 March 2010.  The closing date for receipt of applications was Monday 17 May 2010 and at close of business on that day some 4,400 applications had been submitted to my Department&rsquo;s office at Johnstown Castle Estate in Wexford.  However, given the short time frame for submitting applications, and in order to facilitate farmers, applications were also accepted in my Department&rsquo;s local offices.  These application are currently being forwarded to be processed centrally in Wexford.  Current indications are that the total number of applications will be close to 8,000, but the actual figure cannot be ascertained until all applications have been received and recorded in Wexford.</P>
        <P>Under EU Regulations, payments can not be made until all applications received have been subjected to a rigorous administrative check, including an area cross-check with the declarations received under the Single Payment Scheme.  It is not possible, at this early stage, to anticipate how long this process will take but my objective is to ensure that it is completed and that payments issue as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>There were 2,703 applications for REPS 4 in County Mayo.  Of these, 2,081 have been paid in full and the remainder are being processed.  The acceptance of REPS 4 applications is governed by EU Regulations which require exhaustive administrative checks and on-the-spot inspections.  In a significant number of the applications received, the administrative checks raised issues and queries which required further detailed examination.  My Department&rsquo;s staff have been working to resolve these as quickly as possible.  Many of these cases required the applicants&rsquo; planners to amend the farm plans that were submitted originally.  The applicants concerned were made aware of the position and the applications are being further processed without delay on receipt of amended plans.</P>

	<P>A substantial proportion of expenditure under the Department&rsquo;s Vote comprises schemes and activities which are subject to external factors such as demand from beneficiaries, market and economic factors, animal disease incidence and the pace at which capital investment and research projects are completed by the beneficiaries of grant aid.  Accordingly, savings on the funding provided in the Vote can and do arise due to lower than anticipated drawdown on various demand-led schemes.  Conversely, the need for additional spending under particular headings can also arise.</P>

	<P>The details requested are set out in the tabular statement attached. The acceptance of REPS 4 applications is governed by EU Regulations which require exhaustive administrative checks and on-the-spot inspections.  In a significant number of the applications received, the administrative checks raised issues and queries which required further detailed examination. My Department&rsquo;s staff have been working to resolve these as quickly as possible. Many of these cases required the applicants&rsquo; planners to amend the farm plans that were submitted originally.  The applicants concerned were made aware of the position and the applications are being further processed <Col N="325"/>without delay on receipt of amended plans.  So far, 24,023 applicants have received full payment for 2009 and work is continuing to process the remainder as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>My officials have also been in contact with the 111 applicants whose plans had been rejected, to inform them of their right to appeal the decision. Alternatively, unless the application had been found to be fundamentally ineligible, applicants were given the opportunity to submit a new REPS 4 plan and application form on or before 17 May 2010.  The latter cases will be dealt with as a priority.</P>

	<P>The Farm Structure Survey (Central Statistics Office 2007) showed that 51 percent of all farmers were aged 55 or more, while 26 percent were aged 45 or less. Specialist tillage farmers and dairy farmers tended to have a younger age profile with 46 and 39 percent respectively over the age of 55.  As part <Col N="327"/>of the 2020 Strategy we are currently developing, my Department has commissioned the Rural Economy Research Centre of Teagasc to develop estimates of future farm numbers in 2020. This research, which is still ongoing, includes an examination of the demographic profile of farmers.</P>

Eligibility for assistance is determined by an analysis on a case-by-case basis of the information provided by the grower. The objective of the verification process is to establish not only the losses but also the impact of such losses on the grower&rsquo;s overall enterprise. Eligible growers are required to demonstrate that the potatoes and vegetables were damaged by frost and the extent of that damage. This assessment is ongoing and as soon as it is concluded payments will commence to issue to all applicants confirmed eligible.

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the need for budgetary adjustment has made it necessary to discontinue the Millennium Partnership Fund from the 2010/11 academic year. The fund was disbursed by local Partnership Companies, mostly in the form of small grants to individual students to cover costs of items such as books and travel. Most students in receipt of support from the fund will continue to be supported under the means-tested student maintenance grant schemes and many will benefit from the significantly higher special rate of grant. In addition, third level students in difficult financial circumstances will continue to have access to the Student Assistance Fund.  Part-time courses did not qualify for support under the Millennium Partnership Fund.</P>

	<P>My Department submitted an application to the European Commission in October 2009 for co-financing support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) towards the cost of a personalised package of retraining, upskilling, entrepreneurial supports and educational opportunities for workers made  redundant at the S R Technics facility in North County Dublin.  Earlier this year, the European Commission sought additional clarifications in relation to the EGF application. My Department has provided all additional information sought to date. The total value of the EGF programme of personalized supports for SR Technics workers is estimated at &euro;11.5m of which the maximum 65% EGF support of &euro;7.4m is being sought by the Irish authorities. The EGF application is currently being considered by the European Commission. </P>
        <P>The EGF application process from initiation to final decision is a lengthy procedure involving not just the European Commission but also the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. In the case of the EGF application in relation to workers made redundant at the DELL plant in Co. Limerick, the full approval process took some six months while receipt of EU monies took a further three months. It is also important to stress that there is no guarantee of success of any EGF application.  In the interim, state agencies such as FAS, Enterprise Ireland and the City and County Enterprise Boards have made, and continue to make, the full range of their employment, training, guidance and advisory services available to all workers made redundant at S R Technics. A full range of education programmes provided by the VEC and third level sector is also available.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary statutory responsibility for child protection lies with the Health Service Executive. The role of my Department is to provide guidance and support to schools in implementing child protection policy and to refer any allegations the Department receives to the appropriate authorities for investigation. </P>
        <P>My Department has issued child protection guidelines and procedures to all schools. The guidelines are based on Children First &mdash; the Department of Health &amp; Children&rsquo;s national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children. The Children First guidelines make very clear the reporting and investigation mechanisms to be followed in cases of suspected child abuse wherever they occur, and the lead role of the HSE. The guidelines for schools require each board of management to designate a senior member of staff, normally the principal, as the Designated Liaison Person (DLP) for the school. The DLP acts as a liaison person with the health authorities and other agencies on child protection issues and as a resource person to any staff member who has concerns in this regard.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for ensuring that child protection requirements are complied with rests with the school board, the principal and the staff of each school. The Inspectorate of my Department undertakes whole-school evaluations in line with its quality assurance remit set out in Section 13 of the Education Act 1998. The WSE process involves evaluating schools under the areas of management, planning, curriculum provision, teaching and learning and student support.</P>
        <P>The procedures in these evaluations include a specific review of school policies in the area of child protection. This review involves checking that each school has formally adopted the child protection guidelines as recommended in Children First and in the child protection guidelines of the Department of Education and Science. Confirmation is sought from the school authorities that the child protection procedures have been brought to the attention of manage<Col N="333"/>ment, school staff and parents and that a copy of the procedures has been provided to all staff (including all new staff). The procedures also involve checking that a Designated Liaison Person (DLP) has been nominated by the school. Where necessary, inspectors examine the minutes of board meetings, the recorded details of the adoption of the school&rsquo;s child protection policy and official school documentation naming the Designated Liaison Person (DLP).</P>
        <P>Inspectors may also follow up on any issues with members of school management and staff. The relevant findings are included in the WSE inspection report which is provided to the school&rsquo;s board of management and published on the Department&rsquo;s website. In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Schools Division may also follow-up with schools, where appropriate. The investigation of cases of concern reported to the Health Service Executive by a Designated Liaison Person is a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE), within its statutory remit, as distinct from the statutory remit of the Inspectorate under the Education Act, 1998 in relation to inspections. Accordingly the Inspectorate does not examine the details of individual files or cases.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in anticipation of the review and recent updating of Children First, my Department wrote to all the education partners last Autumn inviting submissions from them on potential changes that might be desirable to the Department&rsquo;s existing child protection guidelines to schools.  The education partners were also invited to participate in a working party to review the guidelines and the working party commenced its work before Christmas. A review of oversight arrangements in relation to cases that rise in schools is an element of that work.</P>

	<P>The funding arrangements made by my Department for second-level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second-level system. At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.   My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of <i>per capita </i>grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. </P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2009, the standard <i>per capita </i>grant was increased by &euro;14 per pupil and now amounts to &euro;345 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of &euro;8 per pupil in 2009 in the support services grant bringing that grant to &euro;212 per pupil.</P>
        <P>The cumulative increase of &euro;22 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to &euro;557 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the <i>per capita</i> funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.  For example, in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support services to over &euro;318,500.  The corresponding figure in 2000 was approximately &euro;147,300.  Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector, along with those in the VEC sector, are increased on a pro rata basis in line with increases in the per capita grant paid to voluntary <Col N="334"/>secondary schools. All schools are eligible for recurrent<i> per capita</i> grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.</P>
        <P>My Department has provided an estimated &euro;21million to voluntary secondary schools in equalisation funding to date.  These significant increases in the funding of post-primary schools are a clear demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. I will consider how best to complete the process of equalisation of funding at second level having regard to available resources.</P>

	<P>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department has received an application for large scale capital funding to provide accommodation to cater for the amalgamation of the two primary schools in the town to which he refers. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 1.4 rating.  A technical inspection of the existing buildings found that neither would be suitable to act as a host for the new school. The report recommended a greenfield site solution.</P>
        <P>A preferred site of 2 acres adjacent to the school was identified which, along with one of the existing school sites, could accommodate the amalgamated school.  In December 2009, representatives of the school authority undertook to consider the acquisition of this site.  My Department has not yet heard from the school authority regarding its consideration of this matter.</P>
        <P>When the site is acquired, the progression of this project, as with all large scale building projects, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to the provision, maintenance and modernisation of physical education and physical activity facilities in our schools for our children and young people.  In a new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as an intrinsic part of the design.  Curricula are in place for PE in primary schools and at Junior Cert level. Primary schools received &euro;2000 each in PE equipment grants in 2006, at a total cost of &euro;6.5 million.  A similar grant of &euro;4,000 per school, at an overall cost of around &euro;3 million, issued to post-primary schools in 2007. </P>
        <P>It is also open to primary schools to use their annual minor works grant to purchase items of furniture and/or equipment. Individual primary schools received a grant in the sum of &euro;5,500 plus &euro;18.50 per pupil for the current school year.  Schools may apply for major capital funding for sports infrastructure such as PE Halls by completing and submitting the appropriate forms on my Department&rsquo;s website.  In addition, schools may also apply to repair or refurbish existing infrastructure under the Summer Works Scheme, which is operated by my Department.  In addition, schools may apply for funding for sports infrastructure from the Department of Culture, Tourism and Sport under the Sports Capital Programme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 434 and 442 together.</P>
        <P>Teacher allocations to all second-level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the Board of Management of the school.</P>
        <P>In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e. curricular concessions. This concession is available as a short term support to enable essential curricular provision to continue.  The <Col N="338"/>allocation processes also include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against their allocation of teachers. The school in question has availed of this appeals mechanism and will be notified of the outcome shortly.  The Appeals Board operates independently of my Department.</P>

        <Quest> the number of special needs assistants employed in primary, special and post-primary schools in County Clare in each of the past five years to 2009; the number employed in primary, special and post-primary schools in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The information requested by the Deputy on the number of special needs assistants employed in schools in County Clare is not readily available in the requested format. As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENO) for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. </P>
        <P>The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any surplus identified. Furthermore, schools can make applications at any time with the result that the individual situation of any school can change and allocations are not static. The Deputy may wish to liaise directly with the NCSE in the context of his enquiry.  I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs. The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and resources will continue to be allocated to schools to meet children&rsquo;s needs in line with my Department&rsquo;s policy.</P>

	<P>It is my Department&rsquo;s intention to provide a new building for the school to which the Deputy refers on a site which is being made available by the VEC.  The progression of a building project for the school, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme. However, in view of the level of demand on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

	<P>At the end of each year this Department prepares a set of Annual Accounts known as the Appropriation Accounts, comparing the sums voted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann under the Appropriation Act for that year (including the amount that could be used as appropriations-in-aid of expenditure) with the actual expenditure outturn for each subhead in Vote 26: Education &amp; Science (Education &amp; Skills with effect from 1 May 2010).  In accordance with current statutory requirements these accounts are prepared on a &ldquo;Cash&rdquo; rather than an &ldquo;Accruals&rdquo; basis, meaning that any unspent monies on the Vote at 31 December must be surrendered to the Exchequer. </P>
        <P>This Department monitors expenditure trends throughout the year. However, due to varying rates of progress on different schemes/projects on the Department&rsquo;s Vote, actual expenditure can differ from that originally estimated at the beginning of the year. In order to deal with this eventuality, and with the sanction of the Department of Finance, a process known as &ldquo;Virement&rdquo; is used to allow for savings on one or more subheads to be used to meet excesses on <Col N="343"/>other subheads.  In relation to 2007 and 2008, the information requested by the Deputy is contained in the Appropriation Accounts for those years. The 2009 Appropriation Accounts are currently being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and will not be available until later in the year.</P>
        <P>The tables contain the following: Summary Table of the 2007 and 2008 Appropriation Accounts along with the provisional Accounts for 2009; and Extracts from the 2007 and 2008 Appropriation Accounts containing the information sought by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) provides behaviour improvement support and advice to 62 schools nationally and special behaviour support classrooms/programmes have been established in 30 of these schools. Behaviour support classrooms/programmes provide an individualised intensive intervention for students who are unable to abide by a schools code of behaviour. This intervention teaches appropriate behaviours to students and also addresses literacy issues if they arise. The core purpose of a behaviour support classroom/ programme is to enable a student to access all education provision in their school.  All schools with a behaviour support classroom/programme have the equivalent of two additional teachers above their allocation. The school in question has a behaviour support classroom/programme and therefore has the equivalent of two additional teachers above their allocation. In addition the school also has the ongoing support and advice from a Regional Development Officer.</P>

	<P>The principal financial support available to students in higher education is the student maintenance grant. Students who are entering approved courses are eligible for financial assistance where they satisfy the relevant conditions including those relating to residency, means, age, nationality and previous academic attainment.</P>
        <P>When the Minister announced details of the student maintenance grant schemes for the 2009/2010 academic year notice was given that, with effect from the start of the 2010/2011 academic year, further changes would be introduced including a change to the residency requirement in the State for grant eligibility which will be increased from one year to three out of the past five years for the student &mdash; a move that is in line with provisions already outlined in the Student Support Bill.</P>
        <P>The full criteria for the 2010 maintenance grant schemes were announced yesterday 24th May, 2010.  Clause 4.1.1 in relation to residency of the 2010 Higher Education Grants Scheme states:</P>
        <P>&ldquo;The candidate shall have been ordinarily resident in the State for at least three out of the last five years immediately preceding the date on which a year of study on an approved course in an approved institution commences. If not so resident, the candidate shall have been temporarily resident outside of the State by reason of pursuing a course of study or postgraduate research at an approved institution outside of the State but within an EU Member State, and was resident in the State for at least 3 out of the 5 years immediately preceding the date on which they commenced such course of study or postgraduate research&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant assessing authority, i.e. the applicant&rsquo;s local authority or VEC. An applicant may appeal the decision to the relevant local authority or VEC.  Where the assessing authority decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may appeal this decision to my Department by submitting an appeal form outlining clearly the grounds for the appeal.

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no requirement for local school authorities to report incidents or allegations of bullying to my Department, nor do I believe that this should be the case.  Under the Education Act 1998, legally, all schools are managed, on behalf of the school Patron or Trustees, by school Boards <Col N="356"/>of Management who employ the teachers at the school. Whereas as I, as Minister for Education and Skills provide funding and policy direction for schools, neither I, as Minister, or my Department have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course or direction with regards to individual complaint cases, other than in relation to appeals taken against refusal to enrol, suspension, or expulsion, under Section 29 of the Education Act.</P>
        <P>Agreement has been reached between teacher unions and school management bodies about the procedures which should apply when investigating and replying to complaints in schools. Where parents raise a concern with schools, I support an approach whereby schools keep parents informed throughout the decision making process; and inform parents of both its decision as well as the reason for its decision.  Accordingly, responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school, as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established and at that level that actions should be taken to address allegations of bullying.</P>
        <P>I am, however, anxious to support schools in tackling bullying and it is for that reason that a number of supports have been put in place in recent years to assist schools in dealing with this important issue.  The Board of Management of each school is required to prepare a code of behaviour in accordance with Section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. To assist schools in formulating such a code, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) has developed guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour.  My Department further requires each school to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
        <P>The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.  My Department has also issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.</P>
        <P>My Department has additionally published policy templates for post-primary schools in five key areas, including anti-bullying on its website of as part of our ongoing efforts in this regard. The template documents are not prescriptive, but rather highlight possible approaches and potential material for inclusion in school policies.  The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour. However, it does take account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes, and reference is also made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.</P>
        <P>My Department does receive a number of complaints and queries from parents regarding matters such as bullying, involving schools.  In dealing with complaints the Department&rsquo;s role is to provide advice to parents and students on the operation of schools&rsquo; complaints procedures and to clarify for parents and pupils how grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed. In providing such advice, the Department brings to the attention of parents that should they wish to make an allegation of child abuse, or report a matter relating to child safety or the protection of children that they may report this matter to the Department of Education <Col N="357"/>who will then deal with the allegation in accordance with its role and child protection procedures.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Skills takes issues of a child protection nature extremely seriously. The role of the Department of Education and Skills in relation to allegations of child abuse is firstly to offer guidance and support to schools in implementing child protection policy, and secondly, to ensure that it brings any child abuse allegations that it receives to the attention of both the school concerned and the health Service Executive (HSE), or Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in accordance with Office Notice SG0 01/07: Child Protection Guidelines for Persons Employed by the Department of Education.  Parents may also report allegations of child abuse directly to the HSE or Garda.</P>

These guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and state, inter alia, that the Board of Management of a school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and that schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy,  the code of behaviour should  indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of  the school &lsquo; s bullying policy .</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour in Primary and Post-Primary Schools&rdquo; were issued in September 1993, as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard.

	<P>The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</P>
        <P>Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order to assist in securing a school placement. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

My Department is not in a position to give an exact date at present, but I will inform the deputy when the refunds are due to issue. </P>

	<P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in second-level schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </P>
        <P>Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  My role as Minister does not involve me identifying specific placements for individual children, but requires me to provide for Education by providing grants and funding for buildings, equipment, salaries of teachers, as well as the recognition of qualifications and inspection of facilities.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The National Educational Welfare Board will be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) can also assist parents with regard to education services for persons with special educational needs.</P>

	<P>The provision of a new building for the school to which the Deputy refers necessitates the acquisition of a site.  The Patron has decided to make this acquisition.  When a site is available, consideration can be given to the inclusion of a building project for the school in the School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of the current level of demand on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of a building project for the school at this time.</P>
