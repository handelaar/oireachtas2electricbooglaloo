       <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There were two reports from the public service benchmarking body.  The increases recommended in the first report of the body in June 2002 were implemented in my Department as follows: 25% of the recommended increase was paid in June 2003, with effect from 1 December 2001, and the total cost to December 2003 was approximately &euro;405,000; 50% of the recommended  increase was paid from 1 January 2004, at an approximate cost of &euro;491,000 for that year; and the final 25% of the recommended increase was paid from 1 June 2005 at an approximate cost of &euro;150,000 for that year.  The full-year cost of the increases in 2006 was approximately &euro;800,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second report of the public service benchmarking body in December 2007 recommended an increase of 1.1% for the grade of principal officer.  No other increase was recommended in respect of general Civil Service grades.  No payment has been made to date by my Department in regard to this recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the Department of the Taoiseach and generally, does the Taoiseach think it satisfactory that pay awards were given without efficiencies being made contingent upon them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>All the payments made were based on various efficiencies and improvements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does he have a list of the efficiencies that resulted in his own Department from the payment of the awards recommended in the 2002 and 2007 reports?  Can he give instances of increased efficiencies as a result of the payment of benchmarking awards in his Department?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="226"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have that information before me but I make the general point that industrial peace continued throughout that period.  Certain payments were made where the bases for them were adhered to and where they were not adhered to, the payments were not made.  The full year cost of benchmarking was in the region of &euro;1.2 billion.  Deputy Kenny will be aware that the changes we introduced last year, which are being implemented on the basis of the Croke Park agreement, will have a full year effect of &euro;1.8 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach does not have the information before him because there is none.  As Minister for Finance and in his current position, the Taoiseach presided over huge levels of waste and cost inflation in public spending and a failed value for money strategy without even the smallest of reforms.  The discussion that has been ongoing in the public domain over the past several weeks about bank time and the cashing of pay checks, which are paid electronically, should have taken place in 2002 and 2005.  Was that issue raised in the context of the benchmarking awards paid to the civil servants in his Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have that information before me but I can get it for the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Has he commenced a review of the traditional privilege days at Christmas and Easter?  Is that issue being considered as another area of reform?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>These are issues which I can answer if specific questions are tabled.  I was asked to give a specific reply on the cost of the first and second benchmarking awards in my Department.  If the Deputy is suggesting that benchmarking was provided on the basis of no change, he is not correct.  The Revenue on-line service was a result of the benchmarking process, as was the question of stability and change in the education curriculum.  One could set out a range of reforms and improvements which resulted from benchmarking.  Where a delay occurred in implementing agreed changes, payments were delayed until the changes were delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach that changes were introduced in some areas.  Revenue is one such example and that is both significant and welcome.  He referred to the Department of Education and Skills.  Last week, we saw evidence that &euro;300 million set aside for building schools was not being spent by that Department.  What sort of benchmarking progress was made in that instance?  Now we hear the money will be spent before the end of the year.  What efficiencies are being made on distributing moneys voted for capital works?  Thousands of small contractors are out of business despite being willing and able to tender at prices which are much lower than was previously the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, this question relates to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It relates to benchmarking.  Surely the process or system in the Department of Education and Skills could have been streamlined in the last eight years to allow money voted through this House for capital works that are necessary for thousands of school places, and for children and their teachers, to be implemented.  We should not be hanging on, halfway through November, because &euro;300 million has yet to be spent by the Department of Education and Skills and may have to be sent back, except for the bit that is retained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy needs to inform himself of the facts.  A great deal of the capital spend in the education sector takes place at the back end of the year, when payments are made.  The significant ICT moneys that are now being dispensed also come out of that capital spend.  Multi-annual capital budgeting came into vogue under this Administration.  When the Deputy was last in office, the problem was that schools did not know what allocations they would get <Col N="227"/>from one year to the next.  That is probably one of the reasons so little got done.  We are seeing excellent value for money in the education sector.  Our carry-over facility is enabling us to deal with tendering prices on a multi-annual basis.  These are good examples of value for money, which was mentioned by the Deputy.  Money is being spent in a planned way as projects which have been approved for construction to begin are being completed.  The devolved grants scheme, which was introduced under this Administration, and the summer works scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>They are good schemes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;have given small builders huge opportunities that did not exist before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Hundreds of schools have benefited from the schemes, which help small builders to obtain contracts for public works, such as necessary improvements in schools throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach made reference to the two benchmarking reports, the first of which was paid in full.  He said that the second report, which was produced in 2007, has not been paid.  Do I take it that the 2007 agreement has been set aside, particularly in light of the contents of the Croke Park agreement, which commits to no further pay increases before 2014?  When the arrangement whereby public servants are given half an hour off to cash their cheques was raised and became an issue recently, I was one of those who were surprised that it had not been weeded out of the system in return for earlier benchmarking payments.  Can I ask why that was not done?  Why was the benchmarking agreement not availed of to bring that practice to an end?  When we asked questions about the Croke Park agreement in mid-October, the Taoiseach told the House that action plans had been submitted.  Can he give the House specific details of the proposals in the action plan that has been submitted by the Department of the Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to comment on the position of any individual union on the specific matter raised by the Deputy.  It is important to note that the public service unions have agreed to the terms of the Croke Park agreement.  Moreover, they have been looking for details of the management&rsquo;s proposals for achieving savings and efficiencies in the cost of delivering public services.  Officials at management level within the Civil Service have given details of the proposals they intend to pursue to secure efficiencies and greater productivity to the Civil Service unions for consultation in advance of submission to the implementation body.  The unions have also agreed to a fast-track binding mechanism for the resolution of disputes.  I anticipate that Civil Service management will avail of those mechanisms where necessary.</P>
        <P>I was also asked about the various sectoral action plans, with specific reference to the savings to be achieved under the Department of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s action plan under the Croke Park agreement.  The Department employs 191 whole-time equivalents.  It has reduced its overall staff numbers by 10% since January 2008.  We will continue to reduce staff numbers by a further 2% below the employment control framework set by the Department of Finance, while maintaining the quality of the services we provide.  Some 35 staff members have been redeployed to other Departments since January 2008.  We will continue to actively facilitate the reallocation of staff to those areas of greatest need, in accordance with the redeployment arrangements set out in the agreement.  The Department has already discontinued five of the six bodies under its direct control.  The remaining body, the National Economic and Social Development Office, will continue to be subject to positive transformation.  Vacancies at assistant secretary level will continue to be filled by open competition and consideration will be <Col N="228"/>given to open competition for posts at other grades, where appropriate, for example, where specialist skills or qualifications are required.  Merit-based competitions are used for the majority of promotions and they will be the norm for all future promotions.  Staffing levels and structures will be reviewed in consultation with staff.  The Department operates extensive opening hours, a standard 6 a.m. to 7 p.m., with 24-hour opening, as required, and these will be maintained in the context of that review.  Between 2007 and 2010, the total budget was reduced by 18.2%, including a reduction of 8.3% in the pay budget.  In the period 2011 to 2014, we will achieve further reductions of 14.4% in the total budget, including 11.4% in 2011, and 4.2% in the pay budget, including 1.2% in 2011.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the status of the 2007 benchmarking report?  The Taoiseach did not refer to this in his reply.  Has the report been stood down?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It only related to increases of 1.1% for the principal officer grade.  Other Civil Service grades were not affected by it and, therefore, that is the only aspect of it that is relevant.  It is the only substantive part of the report.  The Croke Park Agreement, from the date of its signing up to 2014, has set out a review mechanism for spring 2011 and an annual review thereafter and, in respect of any significant savings that will be provided, consideration can be given in the context of those reviews to salaries of less than &euro;35,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government has a very explicit commitment to maintain the pupil-teacher ratio in primary and second level schools.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to give us confirmation and affirmation that there will be no measures in the budget on 7 December that will in any way dilute that commitment or see an expansion of the pupil-teacher ratio?  It is quite particular.  The programme states: &ldquo;...No further increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary and second level schools in the lifetime of this Government.&rdquo;  I ask the Taoiseach to rule out any measure in the budget that would increase the ratio.  The programme also states that the standard capitation grant will be maintained.  Can the Taoiseach indicate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive together.</P>
        <P>The first anniversary of the renewed programme for Government occurred on 10 October 2010.  The programme was agreed last year in the light of significantly changed economic circumstances which have affected everyone.  The core focus of the renewed programme is to stimulate sustainable economic recovery and job creation.  It sets out the agreed areas of focus for each individual Minister whose duty it is to ensure that those commitments within their particular portfolios are implemented.</P>
        <P>As I have stated on many occasions, we all have to adapt to changed economic circumstances.  The international environment, while showing signs of recovery, is still fragile.  Our focus is to stabilise our finances.  Furthermore, we need to increase the competitiveness of the economy such that when the economic recovery takes place, we are best positioned to take advantage of that recovery.  The renewed programme for Government takes account of these realities and sets out mechanisms that will allow us to achieve these objectives.  The implementation of the renewed programme is an ongoing process which takes account of developing circumstances including the availability of resources.  A progress report detailing the programme&rsquo;s implementation will be prepared shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill proposes to put in place legal mechanisms to restrict donations to political parties.  The representative of the Green Party seated beside the Taoiseach said that it was promised that this Bill would be brought before the House this session.  I note from the legislative agenda that the heads of the Bill have yet to be approved by the Government.  Is it expected that the heads of such a Bill will be approved by the Government in this session?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, we hope that will be the case but what is being worked upon at the moment is a priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the Department of Education and Science, a matter to which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred and to which he may return, the Green Party stated that the junior partners in the coalition were determined to maintain support for primary education and to prevent cuts in school capitation.  In its revised programme for Government, agreed just over a year ago, the Government committed itself to no further increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of the Government.  It also stated that it would provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second level schools over the next three years, 200 to be provided immediately and 150 to be provided in each of the following years.  Does this commitment still stand?</P>
        <P>Can we take it that for the lifetime of this Government there will no further increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary and second level schools?  Does the commitment in the prog<Col N="230"/>ramme for Government to provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second level schools over the next three years still stand?  How many of the 200 teachers to be provided immediately have been appointed, have the 150 teachers to be provided for this year been appointed and will the teachers to be provided for the remaining two years of the lifetime of the Government be appointed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that I cannot anticipate outcomes of discussions that are ongoing at Cabinet other than to say that we are doing all we can to ensure that we seek to address the issues we have set out in the programme.  All our programme commitments are on the basis of maintaining financial stability &mdash; that must be the overriding priority.  As the Deputy will be aware, I am not in a position, nor should anyone be in a position, during the course of Cabinet discussions to anticipate the outcome of all these areas.  The Deputy will be aware that they are all being looked at to see in what way we can deal with the adjustments that must be considered not only for 2011 but for beyond then.  We are doing all we can to address these issues in that context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I take it from what the Taoiseach has said that the solemn commitment in the programme for Government is no longer valid?  If the Taoiseach says that at the Cabinet table there will be a stress on the priorities that were to be made here in the context of the programme for Government, there were two clear facts in that respect.  One was that there was to be no further increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government.  It appears that commitment is now being abandoned, if I am to go by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comment.  Second, 500 teaching were to be provided, 200 immediately and a further 150 for each of the years of the lifetime of the Government.  This means that the Green Party has now capitulated on breaking what was a solemn Government commitment.  It means that in the light of current circumstances, to which the people of the country have been led by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, the programme for Government is no longer valid in the context of the discussions now taking place in preparation for next year, or am I to assume that is incorrect and that the Taoiseach can tell me that whatever else happens, these two commitments are to be honoured?</P>
        <P>I hear Members opposite talk about education being an investment in the future, which is true.  I also hear them talk about how we will do this fairly for everybody and that all Departments are being looked at.  A solemn commitment was given that there would be no increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary or second level schools and that 500 teaching positions would be provided, 200 immediately and 150 for each of the following years.  If that is a front line service, will we see it protected?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked if he can assume that what I have been saying is incorrect.  He can take it that most of the time what he says is incorrect.  That is usually the problem when one tries to turn assertion into fact.  It is never a good idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s own facts have always stood up about turning the corner&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely, Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Did he leave the costings at home or what?  On the commitment given last year to have another 200 posts, we ensured this was done.  In the context of budgets, when one is in a Government one is not in a position to discuss budgets or Estimates until everything is signed off.  It is not correct for the Deputy to make the sort of points he is making or to make any assumptions in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The difference is that I negotiated the treaty and probably saw ten drafts of it before the Deputy even heard of it.</P>
        <P>Discussions are ongoing in relation to all of these matters to try to secure an outcome that meets with the requirements of the situation.  All programmes for Government, including those signed by the Deputy&rsquo;s former leader &mdash; the Deputy was a member of a Government himself &mdash; have a requirement for financial stability.  One cannot do things regardless of what are the economic circumstances.  Obviously, we are doing all we can to ensure we can discuss these matters and come to an outcome that meets the requirements of the situation in the best way we possibly can.  That is where things are at and the Deputy&rsquo;s assertions to the contrary and his suggestions of abandonment and so forth are incorrect.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach states that the programme for Government is subject to the economic situation.  I will raise two matters that could not be argued to be subject to the economic situation.  The first is the commitment in the programme for Government to establish an independent electoral commission which would address issues such as the D&aacute;il electoral system, numbers of Deputies and so on.  What has happened to this commitment and when are we likely to see the commission established?</P>
        <P>I was not clear about the reply the Taoiseach gave Deputy Kenny in respect of the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce legislation to ban corporate donations to political parties.  Will the Taoiseach be more specific about when the House will see this legislation?  I understand there was a commitment that in line with the legislation, a political fund would be established to which businesses would contribute generally and which would be disbursed on a proportionate basis among political parties.  What has happened to this commitment?  Will a political fund be established before the general election?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="232"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the electoral commission, the Deputy&rsquo;s question should be directed at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I am sure an update on the progress being made on the matter can be provided.  I cannot deal with each individual commitment in front of me as I am dealing with matters generally.</P>
        <P>The legislation to which the Deputy refers is at an advanced stage of preparation.  Issues are being considered in respect of the matter which will be dealt with when it comes to Government.  I understand it should be with us shortly but I cannot anticipate the outcome of that decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask the Taoiseach about some other matters in the programme for Government.  On the commitment that the Government will not proceed with any new scheme of student contribution for third level education, does this mean tuition fees will not be re-introduced?  How does this commitment square with the proposed increase in the student registration fee?</P>
        <P>On the commitment that 127,000 jobs will be created in the green and smart economies over the next decade, how many of these jobs have been created to date?</P>
        <P>When the carbon tax was introduced last year the Government gave a commitment that a special fuel allowance would be introduced to provide for low income families who are affected by the introduction of the carbon levy.  I understand this was to have been introduced at the time the levy took effect, which was on 1 May 2010.</P>
    
        <P>While it was not then introduced, its introduction was promised in October.  When will this happen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the green economy issue, approximately 250 companies in Ireland now export environmental products and services, as well as serving the home market.  More than 6,000 jobs have been created in that area and I understand there has been a 6% increase in employment in that sector this year alone.  It is a growing area that will grow further.  The Government continues to work on the basis of the excellent green enterprise development group report that provided it with a series of recommendations on which to work to bring this about.  To what did the first question asked by the Deputy relate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It related to student tuition fees.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that discussions are ongoing on these matters and as he is well aware, I cannot discuss these issues.  The Government understands, notes and is aware of the commitments in the programme for Government but until final decisions are made in budgetary terms, I cannot give any indication in that regard.  I should also point out that more than 5,000 jobs have been created in the retrofit industry in addition to the figures I already have outlined.  These are new jobs that are coming through in this sector as a result of policies being pursued by the Government.  On the question of dealing with fuel poverty, this also is a budgetary matter that will be dealt with in that context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny has stolen my lines.  On the issue I raised mistakenly before this group of questions was reached, the programme for Government is clear in its commitment to avoid any increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in either primary or second level schools and uses the phrase, &ldquo;for the lifetime of this Government&rdquo;.  I again suggest to the Taoiseach that his unwillingness to affirm the commitment of his party and his colleagues in power to this commitment places the entire programme in question.  This is a highly important <Col N="233"/>and strong statement of intent and it deserves a better response than the one secured.  I also make this point with regard to the standard capitation grant.</P>
        <P>My final point on education is that the programme for Government states &ldquo;Those with special needs will be safeguarded&rdquo;.  Will the Taoiseach rule out any further reductions in special needs assistance and other supports to keep the commitment to, as the programme states, &ldquo;continue to develop therapy services for children with special needs attending mainstream schools&rdquo;?  These are the areas about which Members are being asked on a continuous basis by people in the education sector.  There are real concerns and worries in this regard that should be set aside by a clear and unequivocal answer from the Taoiseach in this Chamber this afternoon.</P>
        <P>As for the health commitments in the programme for Government, it states that under equity of access, the new consultants&rsquo; contract&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, to whom is this question directed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a question to the Taoiseach.  It states that the delivery of the new consultants&rsquo; contract would help to ensure equity of access.  I recently raised with the Taoiseach the issue whereby it was necessary for some 296 consultants in the public hospital system to be written to by the clinical directors and the hospital managers in their respective locations with regard to their breaches of the contract regarding their responsibilities to the public and the public health system.  Does the Taoiseach not accept this is a huge number of consultants who are in breach of that contract and that clearly, the commitment of the Government in the programme to equity of access cannot be realised when there is such a high incidence of a failure to uphold and to live up to the commitments given?  This is a very serious matter and I ask the Taoiseach what further steps he proposes to take to ensure that consultants who have signed up to these contracts live up to the letter of same.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Going back to previous points, the economic basis for every programme for Government is set out in the programme itself.  It is important to remind Deputies what that is.  The review is based on the plan to correct the public finances, which the Government set out in the supplementary budget in April 2009.  That budget outlined the path to reduce the deficit to 3% of GDP by the end of 2013.  That was subsequently extended to 2014.  During the course of this financial year we have seen reductions in growth forecasts internationally and these must be reflected in our domestic situation.  We must also reflect the impact of the Greek crisis on government borrowings for all governments, and certainly for ours.  That is another matter that has to be taken into account.</P>
        <P>The economic basis of the programme is one to which all the main parties have subscribed.  If we are to reach the programme&rsquo;s target, even allowing for the extension of a further year, we must make certain decisions to bring our budgets back into line.  What I am hearing from some Deputies today is that they want commitments on various aspects, regardless of the course of discussions which are ongoing.  That is not something I should do or can do responsibly.  No responsible Government, at this stage of its proceedings, can make that sort of arrangement.</P>
        <P>All these matters are under consideration.  When one considers that health, education and social welfare account for 70% of the total day-to-day spend one must take into account what adjustments will have to be made to deal with that.  I make that general point.  One cannot make any assumption based on it, other than that the discussions are ongoing.</P>
        <P>Parties such as Fine Gael and Labour adhere to the target of reducing the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014.  They cannot ask me to implement a programme in full if the economic basis of the programme has been changing, and it has been changing.  That is acknowledged by everyone who wants to live in the real world.  The luxury of sitting high on the Opposition benches is <Col N="234"/>fine for Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  In the meantime, no responsible Government can fail to take cognisance of the present economic situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the argument that the reduction of the deficit to 3% by 2014 is a realistic prospect.  Not only do I reject the timeframe; I reject the methodology.  What has any of that to do with the fact that we have almost 300 consultants that we know of, and heaven knows how many more, who are not adhering to the terms of their contracts within the public health system?  That cannot be left to clinical directors and hospital managers.       </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question would be more appropriately put to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>She will not answer it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the Government&rsquo;s commitment in the programme for Government to equity of access, I am asking the Taoiseach what further steps the Government will take to have this matter addressed.</P>
        <P>Another element in the programme for Government referred to by Deputy Gilmore was the independent electoral commission.  Among the tasks outlined in the programme for Government is to make recommendations on the feasibility of extending the franchise in presidential elections to the Irish abroad.  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach on 13 October and he said there was no demand for it and that the case for it had not been put.  However, it is in the programme for Government.  The case has certainly been put.  Last Thursday evening in London, I attended and addressed a meeting of representatives of a variety of social, cultural and other organisations from across the Irish community in London.  There is a very strong demand for this issue to be addressed.</P>
        <P>This is not a party politically divisive proposition.  The extension of voting rights in presidential elections to the diaspora is something to which we can all sign up.  Is it not within the Government&rsquo;s gift&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Deputy will pursue that with the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, I am finishing the question.  Is it not within the Government&rsquo;s gift, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government, to bring that about in advance of next year&rsquo;s presidential election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The commitment relates to the establishment of that commission to consider that issue.  That will be part of its remit when it completes its consideration.  When that work is completed, it can be considered at that time.</P>
        <P>Leaving that aside, I am glad the Deputy met people from the diaspora in London.  They have praised the Government&rsquo;s provision for the diaspora, particularly in the United Kingdom in recent years.  A very strong commitment was made by the Government in this area.  The diaspora has been very happy with what the Government has been able to do, which has far exceeded anything that has been done before.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s point on consultants, at the heart of the principle of accountability is the fact that if issues arise, management can bring people to task and there is a mechanism by which the issues can be reviewed and remedied.  That is precisely what is at play here.  The change in the consultant contract does improve access in the health service &mdash; there is no question or doubt about it &mdash; and it will continue to do so.  Where an issue arises in <Col N="235"/>respect of which one is answerable to management, there is a process in place.  It should not be a criticism of the system that this is the case because management is taking up its responsibilities in those areas.  That is what accountability is about.  It is not that everything is perfect.  However, if circumstances are not as they should be or require investigation, there is a process in place to address them.</P>
        <P>The Deputy does not accept that the deficit should be reduced to 3% by the end of 2014, nor does he accept the timetable or methodology.  In this case, the logic of his position is simple in that he must explain to the people how he would fund the State beyond July of next year.  If he does not have an answer in this regard, his policy means something other than what is suggested.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is currently a gap of 35% between what we are spending and what we are earning.  Next August, it will be the Sinn F&eacute;in policy, presumably, to cut entitlements by that amount.  If fact, it will have to double the cut because we will be six months into the year at that stage.  It is very easy to say one does not agree with this, that or the other, but one must consider the consequences of doing so.</P>

	<P>The time is nearly up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to be as short in my reply as the Deputy is in his questions.</P>
        <P>The fact of the matter is that if one does not take a responsible approach, as one is entitled to do, and one does not believe the aforesaid adjustments must be made, one must explain how the State will be funded beyond next July.  If one cannot explain it, instead of spending &euro;50 billion with &euro;31 billion coming in, one will spend &euro;31 billion next year with &euro;31 billion coming in.  If this were one&rsquo;s approach, one would then have to explain to the people why one must cut services, entitlements and everything else.</P>

	<P>Will the Ceann Comhairle please allow me to respond to what the Taoiseach said?  I am indicating to him, in regard to the wish of a growing number of people in the diaspora to participate in the presidential election, that this wish is not a reflection on the Government, Opposition or anyone else.  I have already indicated it was not party-political, yet the Taoiseach responded as if the Government were under attack.  That is nonsense and filler for his reply.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s approach to 2014, Sinn F&eacute;in has spelt out its policy.</P>

	<P>It seems that, as with the Lisbon treaty, the Taoiseach has not read our pre-budget submission, although it is not only the first submission to be issued but also the only one.  It outlines the alternative that exists to what the Taoiseach is proposing to do.</P>

	<P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, I am not in a position to comment on budgetary proposals.  Speculation on any decision in respect of student registration fees is just that &mdash; speculation.</P>
        <P>The student services charge is levied by the higher education institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and student services.  Students eligible under the means-tested student grant schemes are not obliged to pay this charge.  It is paid on their behalf under my Department&rsquo;s student grant schemes in addition to any maintenance grant and tuition fee support to which they are entitled.  Some 43% of undergraduate students fall into this category and do not pay the charge.  The Government is conscious, however, that for those in income groups just above the grant eligibility threshold, any increase in the charge would be an important affordability consideration.  Research indicates that a range of complex factors which extend beyond financial barriers &mdash; such as societal and cultural issues, parental and teacher expectations and previous academic attainment &mdash; also have an impact on the participation rate of various income groups.</P>
        <P>The growth in participation in higher education has been significant during the past three decades, with the number of new entrants almost trebling in that period.  The expansion of higher education opportunities continues to be an important policy priority for the Government.  In the past three years, higher education institutions have sought to respond to the increases in demand from school leavers and adults returning to education, including unemployed people, by increasing the number of full-time places on offer and also by expanding part time and other flexible types of provision.  The Government is committed to ensuring that opportunities to engage in higher education continue to be made available to potential learners and that access to higher education will continue to be determined by a student&rsquo;s ability and not his or her financial circumstances.</P>
        <P>A key challenge for the development of the sector will be in enabling it to meet future demand on a sustainable funding basis, without compromising on quality.  A widening of the funding base for the sector &mdash; to reduce the relatively high level of dependence on the Exchequer &mdash; is one of the issues to be considered in that context.  The terms of reference for the high level group which was established to develop proposals for a new national strategy for higher education provided for an extensive examination of all issues relating to the future development of the higher education sector.  The group has now completed its work and I am consulting my Government colleagues in respect of the report.  The timeframe for publication of the report will be decided in that context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that the Minister has been in possession of the Hunt report for at least two months, if not longer?  Is it not also the case that issues relating to the report and the reform of third level education have been published in <i>The Irish Times</i> in particular?  It is a disgrace that Members are not in a position to give their full consideration to this issue.  In light of what the T&aacute;naiste stated, the matter will not be considered in the House until the long consultation process is brought to an end.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is it not the case that the incomes which families have determine whether young people can attend university?   There has been a significant and adverse change of means in hundreds of thousands of homes as a result of the unemployment brought about by the Government&rsquo;s policies.  Notwithstanding the agreement between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, will the T&aacute;naiste indicate how much the Government intends to raise through the proposed increase in the student registration fee?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As stated in the reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s parliamentary question, I am not in a position to deal with the budgetary discussions that are taking place at present.  That is unfair to our colleagues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is only leading to speculation.  Second, I agree with the Deputy that it is totally inappropriate that someone might leak certain parts of a document without the Government or Members of the House being informed.  The Government is currently considering the matter.  I have completed the normal Government processes whereby I asked my colleagues for their views to be brought back to Cabinet for consideration and it will then go to the Oireachtas which is the more appropriate way in which these matters can be dealt with, as opposed to mere speculation and leaks in the newspapers.  It shows no regard for the Government or the House</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The facts are that the document has been leaked by somebody who is very close to it, either in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department or the Hunt commission because I have been briefed on its alleged contents by people up and down the country.  The T&aacute;naiste is trying to change public opinion without telling us what the facts are.  The McCarthy report identified &euro;271 million of potential cuts which could take place in the third level budget.  How many of those cuts has the T&aacute;naiste put in place since last year?  Is it not a fact that there are significant issues around contact times between lecturers and students? </P>
        <P Just="Left">According to the McCarthy report savings of &euro;140 million could be made.  If some of the institutions were rationalised &euro;9.2 million could be saved.  There is a list of savings, none of which the T&aacute;naiste referred to in her reply.  The people who will pay for the inefficiencies in third level education will be parents or young people who will have to borrow money they cannot pay back.  The key point, which is the information the T&aacute;naiste has and research shows, is the fact that people cannot afford to pay and it is a factor in them not going to third level education.  The T&aacute;naiste is putting an extra penalty on such people as a result of the Government&rsquo;s decision.</P>

	<P>It is important to say that there are 69,000 people who are eligible for grant aid and support out of the 157,000 people who are attending higher education.  In my response I indicated that there is a cohort of people over and above the eligibility criteria who have found it difficult in some circumstances.  We should differentiate the question the Deputy asked which concerned the budgetary process, a question which I am not in a position to answer, and the future of higher education, which will include where the synergies need to be.  When we refer to the Croke Park agreement, central to this will be the issue of contact time with students. </P>
        <P>We have invested considerably in research and development and have involved people of the highest calibre in the world.  Their expertise should be shared at undergraduate as well as postgraduate level.  It is all about quality of education and making sure that in certain circumstances the educational opportunities are in place and are fit for purpose for a modern economy.  The Hunt report was commissioned because we have not had a third level strategy.  It has mushroomed.  There will be a 20 year strategy for the future development of higher education in Ireland.  It will take change and will have challenges but it is the best we can provide.</P>

        <Quest> if she will provide both the estimated immediate and long-term savings that will arise from the rationalisation of vocational education committees from 33 to 16; if she will provide a copy of the analysis conducted by her Department in advance of this decision being taken; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[41460/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s decision is to reduce the number of VECs from 33 to 16 in order to deal with issues of scale and having regard to the current and prospective  requirements of the education sector.  Consideration of such a reduction had begun earlier as part of an examination of options to reduce the overall number of agencies.  Subsequently, the special  group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes recommended a  reduction in the number of VECs from 33 to 22 and estimated savings of &euro;3 million.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that a saving of that order is a reasonable projection in the medium term.  There may be some increase in this figure given that there will be 16 rather than 22 VECs.  This figure largely represents recurrent savings.  The more immediate savings will be achieved primarily through a reduction in overall staff numbers.  Some further savings should come through the sale of existing VEC buildings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy referred to the analysis that informed this decision.  He will be aware that it is not the practice to publish the contents of memoranda and the analysis provided to Government in reaching decisions.  However, I want to avail of this opportunity to give the House a clear understanding of the  rationale and basis for the decision.  A number of Government priorities informed this decision, of which achieving savings was but one.  The decision is fully consistent with the Government&rsquo;s objective of reducing the overall number of agencies and transforming the delivery of public services.  At the core of this restructuring is the need to address the current low scale and size of operations, in particular in VECs.  For any Government seeking more efficient and effective ways of delivering public services the current scale and size of some of the existing VECs is untenable.  Based on 2009 allocations, 20 of the 33 VECs had an overall budget of less than &euro;30 million and 15 VECs are responsible for five or fewer schools.  Again using 2009 data, excluding the city of Cork and D&uacute;n Laoghaire, where school activity is concentrated either heavily or exclusively on PLC provision, total ordinary second level enrolment was below 1,000 in nine of the VECs.  Even allowing for some adult and further education activity it is difficult to justify their continued stand-alone existence.</P>
        <P>The Government decision can put the sector on a new footing for service delivery into the future.  VECs have served this country well.  When these changes are implemented the sector will be even better positioned to serve the needs of future learners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  In principle, the Labour Party supports the idea of the rationalisation of VECs.  We have all been living with the uneven nature of very large and substantially sophisticated VECs by virtue of their volume and the much smaller ones to which the Minister of State referred.  The announcement was made on 12 October, just under one month ago.  Legislation is promised in the New Year.  </P>
        <P>Has a working party been established in the Department?  Is there a person whose sole task is to drive this project?  When will he or she meet the CEOs of the VECs?  When does the Minister of State think he will have a draft programme on the implementation of the Bill?  Any organisation that is trying to deliver a service such as daily and adult education finds it difficult <Col N="240"/>enough in these times and to have the uncertainty of its future hanging over its head does not motivate staff or create good productivity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his support in principle for this measure.  There is a timeframe of about 18 months to implement this decision.  Discussions have taken place with various stakeholders including the Irish Vocational Education Association  and the association of CEOs.  An implementation group has been established in the Department to oversee this initiative and it is led by an assistant secretary in the Department of Education and Skills.  I have clearly set out the rationale for the decision.  I am pleased that the House in general supports this initiative.  Legislation is promised in due course but in the meantime the work continues in order to implement the decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Can the integration and merger of existing VECs take place without legislation?  There was a reference in the reply given by the Minister of State that he would achieve some savings through the selling off of VEC buildings.  Surely with a growing educational population at primary and secondary level we need every educational building which we currently possess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The work can continue on an administrative basis without legislation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>No, ultimately legislation will be needed.  The groundwork will be done in the meantime on an administrative basis.  The position regarding buildings has to be worked out.  It depends on local factors in each of the VECs, what is and is not needed and so forth.  I can take the Deputy&rsquo;s view that we should retain educational buildings if there is a need for them but again these details have to be worked out.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest>    the details regarding the proposed future reorganisation of F&Aacute;S; if her Department has held discussions with F&Aacute;S regarding the proposed changes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[41602/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The reorganisation and reform of F&Aacute;S and of the State&rsquo;s provision of training and employment services is a process that I initiated over a year ago.</P>
        <P>The first phase involved the putting in place of a stronger board and corporate governance structure in F&Aacute;S and this was provided for in the Labour Services (Amendment) Act 2010.  The second phase, announced by the Taoiseach, involves the division of responsibility for training and employment programmes and services between the newly mandated Departments of Education and Skills and Social Protection.  These changes will improve the delivery of employment, training and community services to the public by bringing together related responsibilities in these areas.</P>
        <P>The Employment Programmes and Services and Skills Training (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order of 2010, which came into force on 1 May 2010, provided for the reallocation of responsibility for F&Aacute;S as an agency and its related funding from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to the Department of Education and <Col N="241"/>Skills.  The Department of Social Protection will, following the commencement of the relevant sections of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010, assume funding and overall responsibility of F&Aacute;S employment services and employment programmes.</P>
        <P>The social welfare and pensions Bill 2010, which is due to be published shortly, will provide for the full transfer of F&Aacute;S employment services and employment programmes to the Department of Social Protection and this would include the transfer of relevant F&Aacute;S staff, property, land as well as certain rights and responsibilities to that Department.  This will amend the Labour Services Act 1987.</P>
        <P>In the period between the commencement of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 and the commencement of the relevant sections of the social welfare and pensions Bill 2010, a service level agreement will be put in place between the Department of Social Protection and F&Aacute;S.  Officials from my Department, F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social Protection are working closely together to advance this agenda.</P>
        <P>The third phase involves the re-structuring and re-mandating of F&Aacute;S as a newly-focussed skills and training provider.  I met with the board of F&Aacute;S this morning to discuss its proposal for a new training agency.  Work has commenced on this process and will continue in tandem with the integration of the employment programmes and employment services into the Department of Social Protection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for her reply.  Will she identify the number of civil servants at senior level or, if she knows, principal officer level, who have now been moved in to F&Aacute;S to deal with the issues there?  I suppose the key question we on this side of the House all want answered is, has the leopard changed its spots.  Have practices changed utterly in F&Aacute;S?</P>
        <P>One of the issues that arose recently was the question of certification of courses, which were fixed &mdash; where people had failed they were deemed to have passed.  Has the T&aacute;naiste heard anything further on this issue and is she aware of an allegation that some participants in the course batch of which I speak, who had originally failed and were passed, were brought back for re-sits, that not all of them re-sat their examinations but they are getting their certification?  That is a serious issue.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to investigate it with urgency because the credibility of F&Aacute;S remains at stake.  Has the leopard changes its spots or not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have detail to hand on the number of public servants who will be transferred as it was not part of the question but I would be more than happy to give Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd the numbers in due course.  This relates to the division of F&Aacute;S training agency and F&Aacute;S employment services, which will transfer to the Department of Social Protection.  I reiterate that there has been a considerable reduction in the numbers within the F&Aacute;S agency over the last period.</P>
        <P>The board of F&Aacute;S has been asked to do a number of things.  The first was to deal with the issues of corporate governance.  All of those issues have been addressed and the mandates set down to them have been met.  There is no point in Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd shaking his head because that has happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The issue of corporate governance &mdash; all of these issues have been met.</P>
        <P>The second issue was to do with the qualifications and quality assurance.  That work has been happening.  Third, there has been an investigation carried out in a number of areas.  We are also changing the methodologies and the quality assurance provisions within F&Aacute;S.  That is ongoing.</P>
        <P>Fourth, it is important to refocus on what benefits a new strategic F&Aacute;S will bring, and that benefit will be learner focused.  We will be strategic in the skills and training needs of F&Aacute;S&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to get in a further supplementary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which will not overlap with other providers in further education and VECs.  The strategic focus will definitely be on how we will provide employment opportunities for our people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The key question I asked relates to the credibility of the new structures.  I repeat that I believe the leopard has not changed its spots, that since the investigations took place participants who were to re-sit examinations did not turn up and the certification is issuing to them, and that is not acceptable.  That is at the core of all of this.</P>
        <P>It is a year since there was an EU audit of European Social Fund moneys which were expended on F&Aacute;S programmes.  There has been a draft decision of the EU, which the T&aacute;naiste has not published for some months.  At what stage is that draft finding against the Department, what response did the T&aacute;naiste make to it and what is the present situation regarding the money that is alleged to be outstanding?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>First, that is totally outside the remit of this question.  That being said, the issue on ESF funding has been clarified by officials in my Department to the committee.  We will see a draw-down of the ESF entitlements on the basis of a new computerisation which is being provided for.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The position is as follows.  I want to give confidence to many who work within F&Aacute;S who, as all of the Members of this House know in their hearts and souls, provide a great service.  We must give confidence to those staff.  We must be learner focused and ensure that we can provide relevant training and skills, regardless of the participants, academic acumen.  We also must provide training opportunities for those with a disability.</P>
        <P>We will see a situation where the strategic focus of F&Aacute;S will be based on the full implementation of its strategic plan.  I will wholeheartedly support the board in the transfer to the Department of Social Protection, in the provision of new services and in how we will ensure that the learner will benefit.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd stated he believed the leopard has not changed its spots.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>

	<P>I listened carefully to what has been said by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.  He indicated two or three weeks ago that he did not want to see private provision of services through F&Aacute;S and now part of his new documents is that F&Aacute;S should be abolished and we should provide its services only through the private sector.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Exchequer expenditure figures for October 2010 were published last week.  Education capital expenditure of &euro;456 million is running &euro;102 million behind profile at present.</P>
        <P>The school building budget is less than &euro;50 million behind profile.  The substantial reduction in construction prices has meant that my Department is achieving greater value for taxpayers&rsquo; money.  Contract prices are now sometimes up to 40% lower than when they were at their peak and a significant proportion of this is an additional reduction on 2009 average prices.  Furthermore, difficulties within the construction industry linked to very low tender prices are creating delays, for example, confirmation of the availability of a bond prior to a contract being awarded is taking much more time.  In addition, the costs of sites have been reducing and there have also been some delays in completing planned site transactions arising from legal and planning issues.</P>
        <P>There are 32 major projects commencing on site in the second half of the year.  This is a significant number of sites progressing through tender and to construction.  In total, it is expected that by the end of this year 53 new schools will have commenced on site.  This compares to projects for 34 schools going on site last year.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills in June last, I had asked my officials in June to draw up possible contingency plans in the context of the expenditure challenges.  I am looking at possible revised expenditure allocations to compensate for the softening of expenditure on schools capital within the Department&rsquo;s overall capital budget.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s current budget is tight this year and there is little contingency available if unexpected expenditure arises in the next eight weeks.  This may arise in the area of pensions, for example, where a number of late applications for retirement may be received.  Therefore, it may be necessary for me to take a prudent approach and set aside a small amount of the capital budget to cover for recurrent spending contingencies.  This will be kept under constant review.</P>
        <P>The main other areas where the Department&rsquo;s capital expenditure is running behind profile are ICT grants and higher education.  In terms of ICT grants, &euro;24 million was allocated to almost 3,300 primary schools last week and the funding has issued.  There is no underspend in this area.  The budget for higher education institutions is some &euro;32 million behind profile.  This is a matter of the timing of the issuing of payments.</P>
        <P>It would not be expected at this time of the year that the entire capital budget would be spent.  The Government is continuing to roll out a vastly improved infrastructure for those at all stages of their education.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="244"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week it was stated that there was &euro;330 million still to be spent.  What has happened to almost &euro;300 million of that in the past week?  I assume the Minister has not spent it in the past week.  What does &euro;50 million &ldquo;behind profile&rdquo; mean?  This is the second year in a row that there has been a huge underspend coming to the end of the year.  By the Minister&rsquo;s own figures in a statement issued last weekend, &euro;250 million has yet to be spent.  Will she assure us this will be spent?  Last year, we had a similar situation and the former Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, stated it would be spent by the end of the year.  However, at the end of the year &euro;80 million was brought forward into this year&rsquo;s budget.  This is unacceptable.  It is amazing because for the past two years, this side of the House has heard there is no money for anything and that there will be cutbacks.  The Minister has money and will not spend it.  A total of 10% of the children of Ireland will spend their entire schooling in prefabs, which is money being wasted because the Minister will not spend money in her capital budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Clarity must be given in that there is a &euro;50 million underspend on schools at present.  There were timing issues and all Members of the House are acutely aware of this because they speak to me about these issues and the frustrations in the delays in a number of projects either through planning or other issues which frustrate the process by which the delivery programme takes place.</P>
        <P>A total of 4,000 schools were supported this year through the summer works scheme.  This is a significant scheme whereby almost everybody who applied was successful.  We have also given conservation grants and rolled out the ICT grants.  All of this is under hand.  It is my intention to have expenditure in my capital programme completed this year.  I will also introduce a number of new systems and methodologies in the delivery of the capital programme on the basis of new initiatives in devolved procurement through VECs and local authorities, which have commenced in counties Monaghan and Louth.  I have also moved on transferring the worth of the rental of prefabs, as the Deputy raised quite rightly, into a composite amount of money that can be devolved to schools to build an extension.  I believe in the ability, particularly of schools with less than six classrooms and their boards of management, to deliver these types of programmes.  We have a new geographical information system, GIS, inventory and site acquisition system.  We are dealing with the programmes and it is my intention to have that money spent.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is the Minister stating the figures given by her Department last week were wrong?  Is she stating the &euro;50 million spent on buying prefabs for the past three years and the &euro;50 million spent on renting prefabs for the past two years will be wiped out?  These are the questions the communities are asking.  I wish to make a suggestion on this issue.  The devolved school scheme has been wonderful because it has delivered at local level.  Does the Minister envisage increasing the amount of capital spending through the devolved scheme?  Local builders are crying out for employment and usually their children go to the schools.  Local communities are in control and they are delivered at a much quicker rate than those through the Department&rsquo;s programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of programmes.  I believe there is capacity in smaller schools to deliver devolved programmes.  I also believe in the capacity of other public authorities in the delivery of devolved programmes of a larger size.  This will happen; it is part <Col N="245"/>of the new initiative I have in the new methodologies of delivering these programmes.  I am sure the Deputy is familiar with a number of them.</P>
        <P>The other important issue is that the full extent of expenditure of allocations in departmental announcements this year will not be until 2012.  This is how the system works.  It can be very frustrating and I know this from being a local Deputy for many years.  The capital underspend on schools is &euro;50 million.  Last week, &euro;24 million was spent on ICT.  Clearly, a number of other timing issues exist.  For example, for the first three months of this year it was very difficult to achieve any drawdown of expenditure on the basis of the weather, about which I could do very little.  Other issues have it slowed down.  I can state that this year there is a larger programme on site than last year and I will continue to ensure that expenditure takes place.</P>

        <Quest>    if she is concerned at the level of investment in information and communication technology in schools which has led to only 2% of schools with access to high speed broadband; her plans to address this situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>Under my Department&rsquo;s schools broadband programme, connectivity to the Internet is routed through a national broadband network, developed by HEAnet, the national education and research network provider.  HEAnet controls the broadband access to schools and it provides centrally managed services for schools such as security, anti-spam, anti-virus and content filtering.  Access to resources such as on-line versions of Britannica and World Book are also only available through the schools broadband network.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has secured broadband services on behalf of schools and under the resultant contracts the best available connections, within resources, were provided.  However, in some cases only satellite services were available.  Since the commencement of the roll-out of phase two in 2009 of the schools broadband programme, there has been more than a 50% increase in bandwidth capacity.  This is due to improved bandwidth speeds being made available to schools and the substantial reduction in the number of schools which are connected via satellite.  Schools are offered satellite connections only where no alternative was offered during the procurement process.  Should a better solution become available from the contractors over the lifetime of the contracts, schools may be migrated to the new solution.  In addition, my Department is working with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on a pilot project using 100 megabits broadband connectivity to 78 post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that broadband is just one element of a wider policy on the use of ICT in schools.  Since 1998, almost &euro;300 million has been invested in the ICT in schools programme.  The programme has addressed four broad areas: the provision of essential ICT infrastructure and networking within schools; the provision of access to broadband connectivity <Col N="246"/>to schools; up-skilling teachers&rsquo; ICT skills; and integrating ICT in the curriculum and providing curriculum-relevant digital content and software.</P>
        <P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ICT in education, the Smart Schools = Smart Economy report was published in November 2009.  This report builds on the 2008 strategy group report, and contains relevant recommendations in the context of how best to realise the potential of ICT use in schools.  Some &euro;22.3 million in ICT grants was provided to primary schools in 2009 and a further &euro;24 million of funding to primary schools has just been announced.  In addition, funding of almost &euro;21 million was recently provided to post-primary schools.</P>
    
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">The National Centre for Technology in Education contributes to the ICT in schools programme in several key respects.  Under its teaching skills initiative, the NCTE offers ICT-related training programmes.  An estimated 12,000 training places were provided in 2009.  Scoilnet, the national portal for digital content in Irish education, provides a central resource to teachers, pupils and parents, offering access to a growing repository of advice and information.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to implement the ambitious ICT in schools programme which will ensure that our schools are making the best use of ICT in teaching and learning.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>The question I asked related to the fact that the level of broadband service being offered to schools, particularly primary schools, has been criticised by the INTO.  It is so bad that some schools have refused to pay for it and have gone about getting their own service.  Is the Minister of State concerned that HEAnet, which was devised to provide broadband to our schools, has been rejected by the INTO, which is the representative body of primary teachers who deal with children in schools?  The progress in this area has been abysmal.  The Minister of State mentioned that 78 post-primary schools out of a total of 3,260 have high-speed broadband in an era when we are attempting to develop a smart economy.  Technology, and learning through technology, is essential.  What plans does the Minister of State have to advance high-speed broadband access to all schools?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>Schools are offered satellite connection only where a better alternative is not available to give them higher speed access.  Fixed wire and wireless broadband deliver faster speeds for schools.  Of the almost 4,000 schools availing of the school broadband service, only 150 schools are now on satellite and this number continues to reduce with the roll-out of faster broadband speed connectivity to the schools in question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>In her initial response, the Minister of State mentioned the grants provided last week for IT provision in schools.  With regard to teacher training, teacher competence in this area and continual professional development, has the Minister of State examined how teachers avail of IT and how they get themselves up to speed in imparting knowledge to students?  It continues to be a criticism that teachers are not trained to deal with the subject of information technology.</P>

As the first step in implementing the recommendations of the report on broadband, a total of &euro;22 million in ICT grants was issued to primary schools in 2009 and a further &euro;45 million was also issued to schools.  In tandem with the funding for schools there is also funding for teacher training.  I will get that figure for the Deputy if she requires it.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> the steps she is taking to ensure that only qualified teachers are working in our primary and post primary schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[41346/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the policy of my Department that schools should only employ people who are on the register of teachers maintained by the Teaching Council.  An integral part of the registration process is an assessment of a person&rsquo;s qualifications.  Unqualified personnel should not be appointed except in the most exceptional circumstances and then only when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted.  This should only be for quite limited time periods.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year my Department directed schools that persons proposed for appointment to publicly-paid teaching posts must be registered with the Teaching Council and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and the post.  Only where an employer can satisfactorily demonstrate that every reasonable effort has been made to recruit an appropriately qualified and registered teacher may an unqualified or unregistered person be recruited, pending the recruitment of an appropriately qualified and registered teacher.</P>
        <P>In addition, a reminder recently issued to school authorities to prioritise qualified teachers, particularly newly or recently qualified teachers, when making substitute and other temporary appointments.  That first call must be given to teachers who are not in work and I appreciate the efforts of those schools who have responded positively to date.</P>
        <P>The Education (Amendment) Bill, currently before the House, contains an amendment to section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001.  Section 30 in its current form prohibits people who are employed as teachers from being paid from public funds unless they are registered with the council.  It is not possible to commence the section without the amendment proposed in the Bill, for two reasons.  First, there is a legacy issue pertaining to a small number of people teaching in our schools who have acquired employment rights and have a certain permanency within the system.  Amending the section will allow for regulations to be made to identify and ring-fence these people.  This is also entirely consistent with the approach laid down in the original Teaching Council Act, which recognised the legitimacy of rights of people currently in schools not to be displaced.</P><Col N="248"/>
        <P>Second, we need a practical solution to the situation where urgent and exceptional circumstances may necessitate the engagement of an unregistered person.  The Bill will provide for the first time for regulations to limit the engagement of unregistered people and will require schools to prioritise the employment of registered teachers over unregistered people while still ensuring that schools can operate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that it is departmental policy to employ only qualified teachers.  However, I ask her how she plans to implement that policy?  If I was marking the Minister&rsquo;s card I would say she must try harder because it is obvious she is not implementing the policy.  Tens of thousands of qualified teachers have to pay a registration subscription of &euro;90 a year and they are unemployed while up to 400 unqualified teachers are still working.  Rather than telling me it is the policy of the Department, what is the Minister doing to address this situation?  Modern technology must make it very easy and I am unable to understand how the Minister can say it is impossible to contact qualified teachers.  It should be very easy to contact them because they are waiting for the call.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is currently no regulation and this means that unqualified and unregistered teachers can teach.  We are introducing legislation to stop this.  Many Members opposite are members of the teaching profession and know that the situation can arise where a qualified teacher is not available at short notice.  I am proposing regulations arising from the discussions in the House on the Education (Amendment) Bill which will be time-limited and for use in extreme cases.  I issued a circular because I am of the view that the last thing any of us want to see is retired people teaching when so many young teachers have not had the opportunity to do so.  I have introduced a system of internship to allow schools take on unemployed teachers, similar to the F&Aacute;S graduate programme.  This could at least give some people the opportunity to become probationary teachers.  Another issue is that many young teachers do not have any teaching experience and therefore cannot apply for a full-time position.  The INTO website shows teacher availability and it is incumbent on school principals to use registered and qualified teachers.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is inconsistent because she is introducing legislation that will regularise the employment of untrained teachers while at the same time she says it is her Department&rsquo;s policy not to employ any untrained teachers.  I ask her to clarify her intentions in this regard.</P>
        <P>Have whole-school evaluations been conducted in any of the schools employing untrained teachers?  If so, there should have been a clear warning sign to the Minister and the Department that untrained and unqualified teachers are being used especially when 30% of graduates of University College Dublin were unemployed in 2009 and many of those are teachers.  It is unacceptable that untrained teachers are being employed in schools.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>

	<P>A brief final supplementary question from Deputy McCormack.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have heard the Deputies opposite say over the years that situations can occur when unqualified persons are employed as teachers.  I do not wish to send children home and I am sure none of the Deputies opposite want that either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister plans to introduce legislation.  I question what her Department has been doing for the past ten years when this legislation was not introduced.  Is the Minister aware that 400 retired teachers are still working instead of qualified teachers?  A total of 100,000 pay days are being claimed by unqualified teachers.  What is the Minister doing about this situation?  I am one of the few Members on this side of the House who is not a teacher but I have a concern for the situation in which many qualified graduate teachers cannot get work and the Minister&rsquo;s Department is continuing the practice of employing up to 400 unqualified teachers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>

	<P>Retirements at primary level since the introduction of the moratorium in March 2009 were 458 principals, 386 deputy principals, 211 assistant principals and 343 teachers with special duties posts of responsibility.  The equivalent figures for the post primary sector were approximately 159 principals, 132 deputy principals, 1,172 assistant principals and 302 teachers with special duties posts of responsibility.  This is based on Department-held data with a <i>pro rata</i> adjustment to include VEC schools.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Unlike other areas of the public service, teaching vacancies continue to be filled in schools.  When the moratorium was introduced by the Government, it exempted principal and deputy principal posts in all primary and post primary schools and these continue to be replaced in the normal manner.  The impact of the moratorium is, therefore, limited to the assistant principal and special duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion.  Vacancies at assistant principal and special duties level arise due to retirements in these specific grades and typically also from the knock-on effect of filling principal and deputy principal posts.  What the school loses is the capacity to make a promotion by awarding the additional allowances to another teacher.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P Just="Left">The position whereby almost 50% of all teachers have promotion allowances is simply not sustainable.  It is a matter for each school authority to re-organise and prioritise the appropriate duties for posts of responsibility holders in the context of implementing this moratorium.</P>
        <P>Some further limited alleviation was announced in July for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at assistant principal level.  The alleviation arrangements are set out in the published circular 42/2010, which provides some delegated sanction for post primary schools to fill assistant principal vacancies if they fall below certain minimum thresholds.  The filling of these posts will be notified by the relevant post primary schools in the coming weeks.  At this stage, the Department has been notified in respect of the filling of 39 assistant principal posts.  Applications for alleviation in respect of 57 programme co-ordinator posts and 18 director of adult education posts have resulted in 25 of these posts being filled.  Applications for alleviation have also been received from more than 120 primary schools and these are currently being examined and prioritised, and the schools will be advised of the outcome in the coming weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Overlooking the situation in regard to principals and deputy principals, in many schools, particularly at second level, there is a huge void in regard to the work that was previously carried out by teachers, not only on a voluntary basis but in a series of areas.  For example, a senior post holder always used to act as the co-ordinator for transition year or as examinations secretary.  The problem with regard to the examinations secretary does not arise yet but the situation will be serious by February.  Many more claims will be with the Department for the reappointment of staff into such posts.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister once more to reconsider the unworkable situation that has developed in many schools.  The result is that many senior teachers have left the service altogether and many junior staff are incapable of doing the work that had been done over the years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated, many other sectors have a moratorium.  We are in a position to replace teachers, including some posts of responsibility, where there is a need for alleviation.  A number of schools lost most of their post holders as a consequence of retirements and we had to bring in at least a base where that work needed to be done.  Since 2009, there has been a reduction in the number of posts but some 50% of teachers still hold posts of responsibility.</P><Col N="251"/>
        <P>With regard to the second part of the alleviation, consideration must be given arising from the schools opening in September.  Between July and September, a situation arose whereby there was a minor alleviation.  In September, I gave an undertaking that we would review the situation, in the advent of particular circumstances, so that there might be some flexibility, although it would be very limited.  The harsh reality is that we cannot continue to have a situation where 50% of the entire teaching community hold posts of responsibility.  The minor alleviation was to address the concerns the Deputy has raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is wrong for the Minister to say a post of responsibility is an advancement in pay and opportunity.  She is rejecting the valuable work that was done by post holders over the years, which was an integral part of the operation of the schools.  We talk of the importance of liaison between the school and the home but that is dead, gone, finished.  How can the Minister justify this kind of change?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The total estimated cost of posts of responsibility is &euro;236 million.  I do not take from the valuable work done on a voluntary basis by many who hold no post of responsibility, and who are usually the ones who are enthusiastic enough never to bother about such posts and go out to do the school plays, the music&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should not load it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are plenty of those, which is very good.  This is the type of thing we will have to instill in life, in society and in the community as opposed to having people being paid to be a volunteer.</P>
        <P>There are other responsibilities which require administrative time, and I do not take from that.  However, what we are trying to ensure is that at the least we meet a minimum requirement so the schools can manage the work they need to do.</P>
        <P>On an issue not raised in the House, I very much appreciate the view of the TUI in that it has stepped back from its industrial action, which I hope will allow greater work processes to take place within the schools in situations where the principal and deputy principal were left to do everything.</P>
        <P>I am cognisant of the issue.  I gave an undertaking that I would reduce the administrative burden on the management of schools.  It is time we used technology to do away with the practice of re-doing 40 times everything that has to be done in a school term.  I have asked the schools to come up with practical proposals, which I will be more than happy to address.</P>

	<P>The acquisition of books, whether through second-hand purchase, as in the website to which the Deputy refers, or through a school rental scheme, is a matter for parents.  However, I welcome any initiative which provides an opportunity for parents and students to acquire books, or dispose of unwanted books, in an efficient manner which reduces costs to parents.  Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on which textbooks to use in first and second level schools are taken at school level.  There are no plans to regulate this area.</P><Col N="252"/>
        <P>Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over-frequent changes to textbooks, primarily to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents.  However, textbooks have to be changed periodically to enable teachers to keep their students&rsquo; work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date.  School authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the renewed programme for Government, my Department issued funding to schools in June to enable them to provide assistance for school  books.  Details of the funding were notified to schools by circulars 41/2010 for second level and 43/2010 for first level, which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  In these circulars, schools were urged to use this funding to establish book rental schemes, as these are the most effective means of lowering costs for all students.</P>
        <P>In total, &euro;14.6 million issued to schools.  Funding was allocated as follows: &euro;11 per pupil in primary schools; &euro;21 per pupil in primary schools within the Delivering Equality in Schools or DEIS scheme; &euro;24 per pupil in post primary; and &euro;39 per pupil in post primary schools within the DEIS scheme.  This funding arrangement affords schools the autonomy to utilise funding in the most effective way based on their particular knowledge of their student needs.  The previous system required schools to apply each year to my Department for a book grant, which resulted in a significant administrative burden for schools and the Department.  The new funding mechanism is part of a process of moving to a more streamlined system where, instead of several specific grants, schools, which are best  placed to know the needs of their pupils, receive one <i>per capita</i> grant that they can assign according to the priorities of the school.</P>

Will the Minister of State analyse how the Department could assist with the running costs of this operation?</P>
        <P>Given modern technology, we need to move into a new era in regard to school books.  It is about time the publishers considered online books.  In some states of the USA, school books are online and free to view and one would only pay to print out the workbook.  The cost of school books is enormous, particularly with so many people on reducing incomes or unemployed.  Will the Minister of State consider the provision by, first, the publishers and, second, by not for profit organisations, or perhaps by a group of teachers or the like, of online workbooks in particular?

	<P>The Department is interested in finding new ways of supporting schools, parents and children in the new digital economy.  In my own constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, the Kilkenny Outreach Centre is doing tremendous work with mobile telephone applications for children.  There is no question that the website to which the Deputy referred enjoys a significant level of traffic and anything that eases the burden on parents is to be welcomed.

	<P>Booksellers also face problems where schools change books at a rapid pace.  However, there is a greater focus on the part of schools on changing books only where it is necessary to do so.  Workbooks are being streamlined and some textbooks <Col N="253"/>contain workbook pages, which decrease the expense for parents.  I am happy to consider anything, including the Internet, that can cut costs and help parents and schools.  Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s question on America, it is my understanding that some states fund the purchase of books.  We are not yet at that stage in Ireland but the Department would be happy to fast-track modern approaches.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>In September to October 2009, the European Commission carried out an European Structural Fund audit mission that included an audit of F&Aacute;S expenditure.  The final report of this mission was issued in February 2010 and raised two areas of concern for the auditors.  The first area where issues arose from this audit was in contract extensions and tendering procedures not being properly followed.  This involved &euro;20,040 expenditure, or 0.1% of the total F&Aacute;S claim.  The second and main area was the reconciliation of estimated costs to actual payments for contracted training for the unemployed.  This was related to the information technology system used to account for this expenditure and it resulted in an incorrect ESF claim of approximately &euro;165,000, or 0.2% of the total F&Aacute;S claim.  It is anticipated that new information technology system will be fully operational by 1 January 2011 and will address the European Commission&rsquo;s primary concern in this area, as well as prevent a recurrence of this event in the future.  In March 2010, the European Commission auditors carried out a follow up audit on the F&Aacute;S issues raised.  A draft report on this audit was received by my Department on 25 June 2010 and was responded to within the two month deadline set by the European Commission.  The Commission has instructed that the draft audit report be treated as confidential and, as it is not intended for publication, I am not in a position to describe its findings.</P>
        <P>The resulting final audit report has not been formally received from the European Commission to date.  However, I can confirm that no EU funds have been lost by Ireland on this matter to date and, as it is intended that alternative spending will be substituted for the above amounts in a future claim, it is anticipated that there will be no loss to the Exchequer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not happy with the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  It is more than one year since the first investigation was conducted into this matter and a number of audits have been carried out since then.  Was the request to treat the draft findings as confidential made by the Department or the European Commission?  I cannot understand why they are being kept secret because there is no issue if the sum in question is only &euro;165,000.  Is it not a fact that the problem does not arise so much from the information technology section as from the absence of documentation or a paper trail?  There were estimates but no receipts were produced.  Is it a fact that some of this spending occurred in 2000?  When does the Minister of State expect to be in a position to respond publicly and transparently to the issues raised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Commission instructed that the draft audit report be treated as confidential and it is not intended for publication.  The final audit report will be a Commission document and, as such reports are not generally considered public documents, Commission approval must be received before copies can be distributed.  However, I am willing to make a statement on the progress of implementation of the issues raised in the report and my Department has replied to previous questions on this matter.  It is anticipated that matters <Col N="254"/>will be finalised by the end of the year.  It is not expected that the Exchequer will lose money because of the substitute expenditure and we are implementing measures to deal with these issues.</P>

	<P>This country has never been in the position in which it now finds itself.  Of the many storms approaching the country, the one that is sure to hit is the issue of mortgage arrears and distressed mortgage holders.  At the end of June, the figure for serious arrears was approximately 37,000.  One year ago, the Fine Gael Party warned of this impending storm and yesterday the economist, Morgan Kelly, estimated that up to 100,000 mortgage holders could be in serious difficulties in the near future.  The Financial Regulator, Matthew Elderfield, made the same point today about mortgage holders in distress.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will recall that when the NAMA legislation was going through the House, my party proposed an amendment that would have facilitated temporary relief among distressed mortgage holders.  Of the many problems facing the Government and the country, this one is staring a significant number of people in the face, whether single, married or with families.  As <Col N="255"/>we speak, many of them are realising they will not be able to meet their mortgage payments inside a short period.  One year after NAMA bailed out banks because of their reckless lending practices and we became aware this storm would hit us, I ask the Taoiseach what preparations are being put in place by the Government to deal with this economic storm, which will have serious consequences for a great number of people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make a general point before taking up the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question.  The Central Bank and the Financial Regulator have set capital levels for the banks to ensure they can absorb losses across all parts of their loan books, including mortgages, and the loss assumptions used by the Central Bank followed an extensive examination of the banks.  The assumptions applied were tougher than those used in the EU tests.</P>
        <P>The level of default in mortgage books is closely related to the rate of unemployment.  Recent data shows a fall in the number of the unemployed in each of the past two months.  Reference was made to the experience of American states such as Florida and Arizona in predicting mortgage losses.  The Irish and US mortgage markets are different in many respects, including the fact that mainstream Irish banks rightly do not see merit in forcing repossessions in a depressed housing market.</P>
        <P>The net cost of resolving the financial crisis is estimated by the Central Bank and its new Governor, Professor Patrick Honohan, at &euro;35 billion.  This is a once-off cost, as compared to the &euro;19 billion budget deficit which we also have to address.  Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s loan book, before provisions, will be almost halved in size after its loans have transferred to NAMA.  Very substantial impairments of its remaining loan book have been factored into the bank&rsquo;s capital forecasts.  The suggestion that AIB and Bank of Ireland combined will incur the same level of loss as Anglo Irish Bank, because they might have had the same exposure to developers, is not a true reading of the situation as far as the Department is concerned.  The steps taken by the Government have been based on the advice of the NTMA, the Governor of the Central Bank and the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>There was some suggestion that at least 100,000 mortgages have seen negotiated repayment reductions or defaults.  This significantly overstates the situation.  The figure is closer to 70,000, which includes restructured payments and the arrears figure of 36,000.  The Government is very conscious of the high value placed on home ownership in Ireland and, in particular, the efforts of Irish people to secure and retain their own homes.  The Government&rsquo;s social and economic policy objective is that home owners who lose their jobs should be assisted to retain their homes during periods of unemployment.  Members will be familiar with the work of the Credit Review Office, which is headed by Mr. John Trethowan.</P>
        <P>The repossession rate remains low.  Some 86 homes were repossessed in the second quarter of 2010, of which 66 were abandonments or voluntary surrenders.  The Government has done much to support those who are in difficulty with their mortgages.  We have provided financial help to over 17,700 families through the mortgage interest subsidy scheme.  We have increased the advisory services provided through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  We have introduced a statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which applies to all lenders.  We have extended the six-month moratorium on legal proceedings to 12 months.  We have refocused mortgage interest relief on those who bought their homes at the peak of the market, with extensions up to the end of 2017.  We have established a mortgage arrears and personal debt expert group, which made recommendations in its first report.</P><Col N="256"/>
        <P>The Government has been able to ensure that a uniform process has been established across all banks to deal with people who have mortgage arrears problems.  A mortgage arrears resolution process has been set up.  It will be incorporated into the code of conduct.  Therefore, the uniform process will be binding.  Banks will have to negotiate on forbearance with lenders, in terms of interest-only periods or interest holidays being provided where appropriate.  An appeals process is in place.  Bankers cannot force mortgagees off their tracker mortgages when they are rescheduling.  They cannot charge penalty interest if people are co-operating with the mortgage resolution process.  Changes have been made to the mortgage interest supplement scheme to help borrowers.  There was a time when one could not get the supplement unless one was unemployed, but now one can get it on a means-tested basis if one is working less than 30 hours a week.</P>
        <P>Those recommendations, among others &mdash; there were over 40 recommendations in the first report &mdash; are being implemented.  The group we established is due to report again within the next couple of weeks.  It is clear that we will consider any further recommendations it makes in that regard.  It is important to set out those issues in response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question about the practical steps that are being taken on an operational basis to assist people with mortgage arrears.  We are making sure there is a uniform process across the banking sector.  We are trying to ensure the banks deal sympathetically with those who find themselves in difficulty, perhaps through no fault of their own, as a result of a change of circumstances.  Such issues will be examined further in the context of the second report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The measures mentioned by the Taoiseach give scant relief to those who are facing personal and family crises.  I accept that they have given relief to people in some cases.  His predecessor had to apologise for suggesting that those who complained about the housing market should commit suicide.  In November 2007, the Taoiseach told the annual dinner of the financial services industry that &ldquo;fundamentals in the Housing market remain strong and the central scenario is for a soft landing&rdquo;.  Those who were seduced and pressurised into buying houses in 2006, 2007 and 2008 are staring into a very bleak future.  I refer, for example, to a couple with two or three children who spent &euro;500,000 on a house on a hillside 60 miles from Dublin, but have since lost one or both of their jobs.  The measures mentioned by the Taoiseach will not deal with their problems.  While I recognise that there is no magic wand for anybody in a situation like this, I should mention that a growing number of them are experiencing enormous pressure and stress.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach said the expert group will produce a report shortly.  The Government needs to recognise that those who were caught in a pincer movement between the housing bubble, which was inflamed by the Government, and the economic collapse are now being crushed to the extent that they see no hope for the future.  A newspaper report on one of the likely recommendations of the expert group is worth noting:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">For those considered unlikely to be ever able to afford to repay their mortgage, the expert group will recommend in its final report that they should be encouraged to hand back their keys and seek social housing.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There are 56,000 people on the social housing waiting list at present.  I ask the Taoiseach to outline, on behalf of the Government, the preparations that are being made to deal with the storm that is about to strike.  Is the Government telling those who lived in Ireland when it was suggested that economic growth would never end that they should hand back their keys and <Col N="257"/>seek social housing?  To what extent is the Government preparing to deal with the catastrophic storm that is affecting so many people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy does not add any validity to his point by engaging in rhetoric about inflaming markets and impending catastrophes.  I accept there are difficulties in the mortgage sector.  Of the more than 1 million mortgages in this country, some 930,000 are being dealt with as planned.  Of the remaining 70,000, some 36,000 are in arrears.  We have redesigned the mortgage interest relief scheme to assist those who bought at the top of the market.  The mortgage interest subsidy scheme, which is providing financial help to over 17,700 families, will be continued until 2017 to assist those who bought when the market was at its height.  A further 34,000 mortgage holders are rescheduling.  That is in line with the processes which have been put in place and are now available across the banking sector to ensure people are dealt with appropriately.  Various things can be done, depending on the circumstances, to help people to avoid going into further arrears.  I refer to interest-only periods and interest holidays, for example.  There is also an appeals process.</P>
        <P>All parts of our approach are very important.  The approach is consistently helping customers of all institutions that have provided mortgages to people on the ground in Ireland.  It has been adopted in response to the fact that people value home ownership.  We want to see people retain their homes where it is possible and viable for them to do so.  I mentioned the level of repossessions in the second quarter of the year, which is an indication of the forbearance that has been shown and needs to be shown in this jurisdiction regarding the whole question of repossessing homes.  That is the situation.</P>
        <P>I could address some of the points the Deputy made up.  There was no question of inflaming the property market.</P>

	<P>What about the social housing recommendation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>At the moment, in order to apply for social housing, one needs to have handed over possession of one&rsquo;s home.  The idea is that people would not have to take that ultimate step before being able to apply for social housing.  They would not be disbarred from looking at social housing as an option, and being able to apply for it, while still living in their homes and trying to deal with the situation with their bank or building society.  That is what is in mind there and, therefore, it is a question of awaiting the second report&rsquo;s recommendations, which will obviously be urgently considered by the Government within the next couple of weeks.  The particular point the Deputy raised is about improving the current situation for people to look at social housing as an option while still in possession of a home that may subsequently be repossessed or vacated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first opportunity we have had since last Thursday to ask the Taoiseach about the decision announced by the Government that day to cut the 2011 budget by &euro;6 billion.  That announcement does not appear to have greatly impressed the markets.  There was a cut of &euro;4 billion last year and no growth resulted.  It is intended to have a cut of &euro;6 billion in next year&rsquo;s budget and the Government expects growth of 1.75%.</P><Col N="258"/>
        <P>I have a number of questions about this.  First, has the Taoiseach any concerns that a cut of this magnitude will further depress the economy, will work against job creation and will hamper growth in the economy?  Second, with regard to the promised four-year budgetary plan, can he give us some clarification as to where that plan is at?  What is the date of publication for the plan?  Third, has a draft of the plan been submitted to the European Commission?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>First, the &euro;6 billion adjustment is a judgment that the Government has had to make in the context of the full circumstances of our situation.  I do not know if everyone took the opportunity to meet Commissioner Rehn earlier but, as the Deputy will know from his party spokesperson, the Commissioner has indicated the support of the European Commission for the front-loading of &euro;6 billion as part of our moving down our deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014.  The Government came out of the markets to prepare a budget and a plan to show a clear pathway to that 3% target.  As the Deputy will be aware, there has been a lot of volatility in the markets and there have been wider European issues involved as well.  However, I would like to make it clear that while everyone has come to assist and be of help to us, the responsibility for these matters lies with our own Government and our own D&aacute;il at the end of the day.</P>
        <P>Second, the difference of &euro;19 billion in what we spend and what we are taking in has to be closed and that has to continue.  I have stated on previous occasions that the adjustments we have made in previous budgets amount to approximately &euro;14.5 billion and we expect that by the end of next year two thirds of the total adjustment to be made between 2008 and 2014 will be completed.  It is true to say that a consolidation of &euro;6 billion or any correction will have a dampening effect on growth potential in the economy but it is also true to say that if we do not make this level of adjustment, the ability of our State to be funded on an ongoing basis will be put at risk.  No strategy is absent of risk but the very best judgment that we have made is the one that we have made.</P>
        <P>As I understand Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s position, he agrees to the target of 3% of GDP by the end of 2014, he believes that an adjustment of &euro;4.5 billion would be more appropriate next year and he does not accept that &euro;15 billion is the calculation for the adjustment based on growth projections that have been submitted.  As we have said, if there is a better performance than that, the level of adjustment will not be of that order but we believe that level of adjustment has met, and can meet, the endorsement of wider international bodies and that is an important part of building credibility in the pathway to the 3% target.</P>
        <P>However, it is also the case that if this country and this Parliament fails to make the necessary adjustments, then we put at risk the funding of the State after July of next year and what will happen then is that we will be faced with a situation where we will only be able to spend &euro;31 billion.  As I said earlier during Taoiseach&rsquo;s Question Time in reply to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who does not agree with this strategy, one cannot go on spending &euro;50 billion when one is only taking in &euro;31 billion.  Being only able to spend &euro;31 billion would involve a serious adjustment in the level of services that could be provided.  No responsible government, therefore, could contemplate that approach.  The approach we are taking is the one we believe in our judgment best balances the imperatives of making a serious consolidation in the coming year, of allowing for growth potential in the economy to continue and, at the end of next year, of being able to say that up to two thirds of the adjustment has been completed.  I believe, taking all those considerations into account, that is the correct approach.</P>
        <P>What was the Deputy&rsquo;s other question?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="259"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about the publication date for the four-year plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have indicated that the date will be mid-November.  We have to finalise that plan and we have to approve it as a government.  That work will continue in the coming weeks.  I will not have an exact date until the decision is made but that is the indicative timeframe we have in mind.  What is important is we have stepped out of the markets, we will bring forward a four-year plan followed by the budget and we need, as we all are being reminded today, to emphasise the strengths in this economy.  We know the weaknesses in terms of the fiscal position but we also need to identify and articulate the strengths.  There seems to be an unfortunate predilection in some quarters to magnify weaknesses and ignore strengths.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Government intends to publish the four-year plan in mid-November, I presume it will be approved next week.  Is it that imminent or will it be somewhat later?  It would be helpful if the Taoiseach could indicate when we are likely to see it.  I asked the Taoiseach if a draft of the plan had been supplied to the European Commission and I would like him to respond to that when he replies to my supplementary question.</P>
        <P>With regard to the &euro;6 billion adjustment, the Taoiseach made two points.  The first is the adjustment is intended to convince people outside the country and certain institutions that the Government is in earnest about making fiscal adjustments.  It does not appear to have made a particularly big impact on the markets.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s second argument is that it is a matter of judgment and he is right in that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the matter of judgment, is it now the case that the markets, in particular, are looking at the lack of growth in the economy as much as they are looking at the fiscal position?  I draw the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention to comments made at the weekend by two senior business people in an article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>.   The first was by Mr. Martin Murphy, managing director of Hewlett-Packard, who placed an emphasis on job creation and said there has not been enough discussion about job creation in the lead up to the budget.  The second comment was by Dr. Craig Barrett, the former chief executive officer of Intel Ireland, who warned against cutting too deeply in next month&rsquo;s budget.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">You need to invest in these bad times. The only companies I know that have been ultimately successful have invested their way out of a recession and not tried to save their way out of it.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It seems that in both of those cases an argument is being put to the Taoiseach regarding the concentration by Government on cutting without investing in getting us out of the recession.  The warning they make about what we are doing, which is shared by many other commentators, is that a cut of the order of &euro;6 billion is too deep and will damage growth and the potential for job creation.  The Taoiseach says it is a judgment call but I put it to him that his judgment in this matter may be wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My answer to Deputy Gilmore is that there is no strategy that is not without risk.  No one can say this with certainty but I want to be clear.  First, we are not doing this in an effort to convince markets, we are doing it because it is imperative that we reduce the gap between what we spend and what we bring in.  That is important for the country.  It is important for sustainable policies going forward.  It is also important as a means of generating growth because we have seen from the policies we implemented, which were opposed by the Oppo<Col N="260"/>sition and which it is entitled to do, that they have brought us from a contraction in the economy of minus 10% last year to stabilisation this year.  We must move into a growth path over the next number of years.  It is true that the consolidation of public finances is necessary.  It has to be done.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy&rsquo;s view is that what we are doing has not generated sufficient confidence, I do not know how &euro;4.5 billion would generate more confidence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There would be growth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  In terms of the growth issue, the investment side of the equation is in regard to a capital programme, which has been historically high; it has been twice the European Union average and has been a far better stimulant to the Irish economy in terms of the putting in place of infrastructure than some of the stimulus packages that are often spoken about by the Deputies opposite as being, in the European context, the best way forward.</P>
        <P>Our strategy for science, technology and innovation has worked.  Increasing resources have been allocated to those areas.  The commitment to that agenda has enabled IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland at home to scale up companies, improve our export performance and improve our competitiveness.  An investment pipeline is coming to Ireland at this time, which is favourable and which has been spoken about.  Many companies are investing in Ireland because of the environment we continue to seek to create here for that sort of investment.  That has happened against a background of a contraction in the economy of 10% last year and even in that year more than 100 projects were brought to Ireland.  That has happened because there is a commitment in regard to those areas, about which Craig Barrett has spoken on many occasions.</P>
        <P>There is the question of investing in research and development and improving our education curriculum quite apart from spending more money.  There are structural policies and reforms that must also form part of our strategy for growth and recovery in the future.  That covers the first point.</P>
        <P>On the second point, quite apart from the size of the adjustment, its composition is important.  I note what the Commissioner had to say today.  I listened carefully to what Deputy Gilmore said in his contribution to the economic debate we had last week.  He made the point that in his view the split in the composition of the adjustment, which he stated should be around &euro;4 billion to &euro;4.5 billion, should be split 50:50 between tax and expenditure cuts.  Commissioner Rehn made it clear today &mdash; I am making the point in terms of how people view it and the opinion on it &mdash; that a greater emphasis on expenditure cuts rather than tax raising is important in terms of creating investment opportunities, promoting job creation and reducing the tax on labour would be preferable in this first major phase of consolidation.  They are the issues for debate and upon which there can be differences, but at least let us have a constructive debate which recognises the realities.  The reality is that this country is currently spending more on the provision of services than can be provided to the Exchequer through the efforts of our hard pressed taxpayers.</P>

	<P>Last week the High Court issued a finding in regard to a citizen whose constitutional rights were being deprived.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Was a letter from the Chief State Solicitor, which was received by a legal representative of Senator Paudie Coffey, written on instruction of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Government?  The letter asks that, in the circumstances, the Senator should not proceed with proceedings before the High Court in regard to a by-election in Waterford and a similar case in Dublin South.  It seems the finding of the High Court has now been acted upon by the Government as the by-election in Donegal South-West is proceeding.  In that case, what is the purpose of taking a costly appeal to the Supreme Court?  Why was the Chief State Solicitor instructed to write to a citizen requesting that legal proceedings not be taken to the High Court for two by-elections to be held in the very same circumstances and on the same principle as the Donegal South-West by-election?</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the same way as a solicitor for Senator Coffey and Mr. Van Turnhout wrote to the defendant, the defendant&rsquo;s solicitor wrote back.  This is a normal course of action.  The Government was entitled to await the outcome of a Supreme Court appeal before moving the writ for the Donegal South-West by-election. However, out of deference to the High Court, it decided to move the writ forthwith.  This deference does not mean the Government accepts the points of constitutional principle laid down by the High Court.  Rather, it considers that the High Court&rsquo;s judgment gives rise to highly important issues of constitutional principle which have not arisen before and which should be settled conclusively by the Supreme Court in the interests of certainty for future elections.  I indicated to the D&aacute;il last week the issues in question.  That is the reason.</P>

	<P>I will not labour the point.  In the event that the High Court on Thursday sets a date for a full hearing of the Waterford and Dublin South cases, will the Government expedite its appeal to the Supreme Court so that a hearing will be held and a determination reached before the end of this term?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I raise the matter is that in normal circumstances a Supreme Court appeal can drift for 18 months before being heard.  While I do not speak for the Supreme Court, in the event that the High Court on Thursday gives a date for a hearing on the Waterford and Dublin South by-elections, does the Government intend to lodge an appeal to the Supreme Court in the Donegal South-West case as a matter of urgency?  It appears the same principle applies.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach indicated that if the Supreme Court determines the case, the Government will immediately move the writs.  When does the Government expect to lodge an appeal to the Supreme Court?  In the event that the High Court on Thursday decides on a date for a hearing, will the Government expedite the appeal in the hope that it may be determined by the end of this term and the position becomes crystal clear?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the appeal to the Supreme Court, we intend to seek a hearing on that action at the earliest possible date.  The commitment I gave to the D&aacute;il in respect of moving the writs in the first quarter of next year stands in relation to the other elections, regardless of how long the appeal will take.</P>

It was brought to the attention of the Government this morning that the report had come to hand.</P>
        <P>While the Irish Human Rights Commission has decided it will not carry out an inquiry under the Human Rights Commission Act 2000, it has asked the Government to establish a statutory mechanism to examine the extent of the State&rsquo;s involvement and responsibility and in the event of State involvement and responsibility being established, &ldquo;that the statutory mechanism then advance to conducting a larger-scale review of what occurred&rdquo; and the redress which should be considered.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Irish Human Rights Commission did not seek any observations from the Government during its assessment process.  We have initiated a review of the assessment report, as published, and will consider its recommendations in that context.  There are a number of Departments, including the Departments of Justice and Law Reform, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Health and Children, Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and Education and Skills, for which the assessment report will have implications and the views of the Attorney General will be required.

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009 and look forward to today&rsquo;s discussion.  The Bill received broad support from all sides on its passage through the Seanad and I look forward to a continuation of that broad support in this House.  The Bill provides for a comprehensive and streamlined statutory framework for the regulation of auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents.  It will replace the current court-based system for regulating auctioneers and house agents with an updated system for regulation of the categories of property services providers I have mentioned.</P>
        <P>Under current legislation, the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts 1947 to 1973, licences are issued to auctioneers and house agents by the Revenue Commissioners on presentation of the required District Court certificate.  The system is confined to auctioneers and house agents and does not extend to property management agents.  The latter comprise a new segment of the property services sector.  In so far as it extends the licensing system to property management agents and extends statutory safeguards to the clients of such agents, mainly property management companies, the Bill constitutes an important element of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to address problems arising in relation to the management and governance of multi-unit developments and complements the Multi-Unit Developments Bill 2009, which completed Committee Stage in the select committee last month.</P>
        <P>The Bill before Members seeks to give effect to the principal recommendations of the auctioneering-estate agency review group.  At its heart is a proposal to establish a new statutory body, the property services regulatory authority, to control and supervise providers of property services and to improve standards in the provision of those services.  The Bill also provides for improved standards of consumer protection by establishing a system for investigating and adjudicating on complaints relating to the provision of property services, as well as a property services compensation fund to compensate those who suffer financial loss as a result of dishonesty by property services providers.</P>
        <P>Before describing the main provisions of the Bill, I inform Deputies that work has begun on a number of amendments that I hope to table on Committee Stage.  In the renewed programme for Government agreed last year, the Government recognises that the lack of transparency in the property market, including the lack of sales prices, is an impediment to consumer protection and must be tackled.  I intend to bring forward an amendment to the Bill to give the property services regulatory authority the statutory function of publishing details of residential property sales prices.  The working group on transparency in commercial rent reviews recommended the establishment of a public database that would include relevant details of commercial letting agreements and rent reviews.  I also intend to amend the Bill to give the responsibility for the gathering and holding of the necessary detail in this respect to the authority.  I look forward to progressing these amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I turn now to the Bill&rsquo;s main provisions to give Members a general outline of its scope and how the proposed system of regulation will work in practice.  Section 2 contains the important definitions which determine the scope of the Bill.  I draw Members&rsquo; attention specifically to the definition of &ldquo;property service&rdquo;.  It means the provision in the State of any of the following services, namely, the auction of property other than land, the purchase or sale, by whatever <Col N="269"/>means, of land, the letting of land; and property management services.  All auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents will, therefore, require a licence from the authority.  Certain limited exemptions to the licensing requirements are set out in section 3.</P>
        <P>This licensing requirement will apply to the property services employer, such as, for example, an auctioneering company or partnership, and to an individual providing a property service in the course of employment or as an independent contractor.  If the property service is provided in the State, a licence will be required irrespective of whether the property concerned is located in the State.  Part 11 contains provisions which deal with the provision of property services here by those who hold licences issued by corresponding licensing authorities in other European Union member states.</P>
        <P>Part 2 contains many standard provisions relating to the structure and operations of the new authority, including provisions regarding the appointment of the authority members and staff, the conduct of meetings and the keeping and auditing of annual accounts.  I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the main functions of the authority set out in section 11.  These functions include the operation of a comprehensive licensing system covering auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents.  In addition, it will set and enforce standards for the grant of licences, such as, for example, educational and training standards, levels of professional indemnity insurance, as well as standards to be observed in the provision of services by licensees.  Moreover, it will establish and administer a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints relating to the provision of property services, will promote increased consumer protection and public awareness of property services in general and the cost to consumers, risks and benefits associated with the provision of those services.  It also will establish, maintain and administer the compensation fund.</P>
        <P>This Part also provides for the charging of fees.  It is intended that this fee income should be sufficient to meet the costs of administration of the Act.  This is in line with the recommendation of the review group that the new regulatory structure should be funded through fee income generated by the authority for licences and other services.  Part 3, comprising sections 29 to 43, sets out details of the new licensing system which will apply in future.  Under section 29, it will be an offence in future for a person to provide a property service without the appropriate licence, unless he or she falls within one of the limited exemptions in section 3.  If a licensee provides a property service other than a service for which he or she holds a licence, or holds himself or herself out as available to provide a property service other than the service in respect of which he or she has a licence, it will constitute improper conduct and an appropriate sanction may be imposed.</P>
        <P>In order to provide ready access to the list of licensees, section 30 requires the authority to establish and maintain a public register of licensees.  This will enable users, or intending users, of property services to confirm that a provider is registered to provide the service they require.</P>
        <P>Sections 31 to 35 contain details of the licensing system.  Each application for a licence must be accompanied by references as to character and competence, including details of education, training and experience; evidence of availability to the applicant of the necessary level of professional indemnity insurance; and the appropriate fee.</P>
        <P>In the case of applications for licences as a property services employer or an independent contractor, the applicant must also furnish a certificate by an accountant that proper financial systems and controls are, or will be, in place for the protection of client moneys.  Such applicants will also have to furnish an up-to-date tax clearance certificate.</P>
        <P>When deciding whether to issue a licence, the authority will take into account the information provided by the applicant and, where appropriate, any information provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under section 43.  In short, it will not issue a licence unless it is satisfied that the <Col N="270"/>applicant is a fit and proper person to provide the property service concerned and complies with all statutory requirements.  A successful applicant must pay the appropriate contribution into the compensation fund before the licence will be issued.</P>
        <P>Before refusing to issue a licence in any case, the authority must notify the applicant of its intention to do so, and the reasons for it, and give the applicant an opportunity to make representations.  It will be possible to appeal any refusal to issue a licence to the property services appeal board which is also being set up under section 74 and Schedule 5.</P>
        <P>Arrangements applicable to the renewal of licences are set out in sections 36 and 37.  Part 3 also includes provisions imposing obligations on licensees to have their licence in their possession and to produce it, if requested, or to display it in their place of business depending on whether the licensee is an individual or a company.  It also requires licensees, other than those who are employees, to include their registration number in advertisements, on their stationery and in sales brochures, etc.</P>
        <P>Section 41 provides that where a licensee is declared bankrupt, his or her licence will be suspended immediately and will remain suspended until it expires or the bankruptcy is discharged, whichever occurs first.  Section 42 requires an applicant for a licence or a licensee to notify the authority of any material matter which would be likely to affect the validity of the licence.</P>
        <P>Part 4, comprising sections 44 to 46, sets out a number of general obligations with which licensees must comply.  Section 44 requires licensees to issue a letter of engagement to all clients.  Once the letter has been signed by both the licensee and the client, it becomes a property services agreement.  Details of the extensive information that must be included in such a property services agreement are set out in Schedule 2.</P>
        <P>A property services agreement must include details of the services to be provided by the licensee, the fees or commission payable by the client and the period during which the agreement has effect, etc.  The authority will specify the form of letter of engagement which all property services providers must use.</P>
        <P>Section 45 imposes an obligation on property services employers and independent contractors to keep records of all services provided for a period of six years.</P>
        <P>Part 5, comprising sections 47 to 55, contains very important provisions dealing with client accounts and related matters.  It updates existing provisions in the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts 1947 to 1973 and, importantly, extends them to property management agents.</P>
        <P>Section 47 empowers the authority to make regulations in relation to the kind of bank accounts which may be opened by licensees for the keeping of client moneys, the rights, duties and responsibilities of a licensee in respect of client moneys, the accounting records which must be maintained by a licensee, and client entitlements, etc.  Section 48 makes it an offence knowingly to lodge client moneys to an account other than a client account, or knowingly to make a false or misleading entry or record in accounting records.</P>
        <P>This Part also contains provisions for the protection of client moneys and documents in the event that the authority refuses to renew a licence, a licence is suspended or revoked, or the licensee ceases to provide property services.  It also makes provision for the protection of client moneys in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of a licensee.</P>
        <P>Part 6, that is sections 56 to 62, deals with the sale and letting of land and includes new provisions requiring auctioneers and letting agents to provide statements of &ldquo;advised market value&rdquo; or &ldquo;advised letting value&rdquo;, as the case may be, to their clients within a  seven day period.  The &ldquo;advised market value&rdquo; of land for sale must be reasonable and the authority may investi<Col N="271"/>gate cases in which values appear not to have been reasonable.  This value can be a price range but the difference between the minimum and maximum value cannot exceed 10% of the lower value.  The advised value can, however, be altered to take account of market conditions.</P>
        <P>Where land is being sold at auction, the vendor will be prohibited from bidding for it and from authorising or permitting another person to do so on his or her behalf.  Where land is being sold by private treaty, section 61 requires licensees to retain records of all offers received, including conditional acceptances.</P>
        <P>In order to avoid conflicts of interest, section 60 specifies the conditions under which a licensee acting for a vendor may provide a financial service to a purchaser or potential purchaser.  It prohibits the provision by a licensee of such a financial service to a purchaser without the prior written consent of both parties.  Section 62 empowers the authority to make regulations in relation to matters concerning the sale or letting of land.  This will include regulations concerning the contents of advertisements, booking deposits, the terms of building contracts and similar issues.</P>
        <P>One of the shortcomings of the current system identified by the review group is that the only available sanction against misconduct is refusal to renew a licence.  Part 7 addresses this deficiency by making provision for a comprehensive system for investigating complaints and imposing appropriate sanctions where such complaints are upheld.</P>
        <P>Section 63 provides that any person can make a complaint to the authority and the authority must investigate the complaint provided it is made in good faith and is not likely to be resolved by mediation or other informal means between the parties.</P>
        <P>Section 64 provides that where the authority considers that immediate suspension of a licence is necessary to protect clients or customers, or potential customers, it may make an application on notice to the licensee to the High Court for an order to suspend the licence.</P>
        <P>In exceptional circumstances, where the authority considers that there is an immediate risk of financial harm to clients or customers, or potential clients or customers, it is empowered to apply to the High Court on an <i>ex parte</i> basis for an interim order to suspend the relevant licence.   An interim order can last for a maximum of eight working days.  In order to extend any such order, the authority must apply to the High Court on notice to the licensee for a new order.</P>
        <P>Section 65 provides that an investigation may be carried out by the authority on foot of a complaint or on the authority&rsquo;s own initiative.  It provides for the appointment of an inspector, or inspectors, to carry out such an investigation and to submit a report to the authority.  Section 66 gives inspectors comprehensive powers to enable them to carry out investigations, including powers to enter and search premises, carry out examinations and inquiries and conduct an oral hearing.  This section also provides that a person who obstructs or impedes an inspector is guilty of an offence.</P>
        <P>Section 67 provides protection for persons, including employees of licensees, who make complaints to the authority.</P>
        <P>Section 68 sets out the actions to be taken by inspectors and the authority on completion of an investigation and includes provisions to ensure that fair procedures are applied.  On completion of an investigation, the inspector must submit a report to the authority.  Before doing that, a draft of the report must be sent for comment to the licensee or licensees where the investigation concerned more than one licensee, and to the complainant if the investigation arose from a complaint.</P>
        <P>After considering an investigation report, the authority may decide to request the inspector to carry out a further investigation, impose a major or minor sanction, as appropriate, if it is <Col N="272"/>satisfied that improper conduct is occurring or has occurred, or dismiss the complaint and take no further action.  Before making its decision, the authority may conduct an oral hearing or invite the licensee or licensees, if the investigation related to more than one licensee, and complainant, if the investigation arose from a complaint, to make submissions on the investigation report.  A &ldquo;minor sanction&rdquo; is defined in section 2 as a reprimand, warning, caution or advice, while a &ldquo;major sanction&rdquo; is defined as the suspension or revocation of a licence, payment of up to &euro;50,000 into the compensation fund, payment of up to &euro;50,000 towards the costs of the investigation, or payment of a penalty of up to &euro;250,000.</P>
        <P>Factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sanction are set out in section 73.  These include the need to ensure that any sanction is appropriate and proportionate to the improper conduct, the seriousness of the improper conduct, any gain made by the licensee as a result of the improper conduct, and the amount of any loss suffered or costs incurred as a result of the improper conduct.</P>
        <P>Sections 69 to 72 contain detailed provisions dealing with major sanctions.  Section 70 provides that a licensee may appeal a decision of the authority imposing a major sanction to the High Court.  Where the licensee does not appeal the decision, the authority must apply to the High Court under section 71 to have its decision confirmed.  Section 72 makes provision for an appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>
        <P>In addition to a complaints and investigation procedure, an appeals system is also essential.  Part 8 provides for the establishment of an independent property services appeal board to hear and determine appeals against specified decisions of the authority.  Matters relating to the composition of the appeal board and its operations, including the procedure for handling appeals, are set out in Schedule 5.</P>
        <P>Part 9, which includes sections 77 and 78, provides for the establishment, administration and maintenance of the property services compensation fund.  Its purpose is to compensate clients of licensees who suffer a financial loss as a result of dishonesty on the part of a licensee or an employee, partner or agent of a licensee in the course of the provision of a property service.  Section 78 sets out rules on the payment of compensation out of the fund.  Detailed provisions in regard to the administration of the fund are set out in Schedule 6.  Part 9 and Schedule 6 are modelled on similar provisions in the Solicitors Acts.</P>
        <P>Part 10 empowers the authority to draw up regulations for professional competence schemes for licensees and principal officers of licensees and related matters.</P>
        <P>Part 11 and Schedule 7 contain provisions governing the provision of property services in the State by persons who hold licences from comparable authorities in other member states.  Rights of establishment and freedom to provide services are set out in the European Community treaty.  These treaty rights have been elaborated in greater detail more recently in Directive 2006/123 on services in the internal market.</P>
        <P>A person who has a licence or other authorisation from another member state to provide a particular property service has a right to provide that service here without having to obtain a licence from the authority.  However, that person must be subject to client account protections similar to those in Part 5 of the Bill.</P>
        <P>A person who is permitted to provide a property service here on the basis of an authorisation from another member state will be subject to the authority&rsquo;s complaints and investigation procedures, and to the new statutory requirements in regard to letters of engagement, client accounts and the sale or letting of land.</P><Col N="273"/>
        <P>Part 12, comprising sections 86 to 98, contains miscellaneous provisions.  I indicated that once the Bill comes into force in respect of any category of property service, the provision of that type of property service without a licence will be prohibited.  In order to ensure that this prohibition is enforced, the authority&rsquo;s powers of investigation extend to persons who are suspected of providing a property service or claiming to be available to provide such a service, without a licence.  This power is set out in section 86 of the Bill.</P>
        <P>If the authority considers that a person is operating without a licence, it must report the matter to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister.  The authority may also seek a High Court injunction requiring the person to cease the activities concerned.</P>
        <P>Section 91 deals with offences and it empowers the authority to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for offences under the Act.</P>
        <P>Sections 92 and 93 empower the authority and the Minister to make regulations implementing detailed provisions in the legislation.  Sections 95 to 97 provide for transitional arrangements to facilitate the transition from the existing licensing system for auctioneers and house agents to the new licensing regime.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for an appropriate and comprehensive new system for regulating the property services sector.  I am confident the provisions set out in it will, when enacted, serve to enhance the standing and image of the sector, provide much-improved consumer protection for the clients of property services providers and serve to assure the public that high standards will be applied and maintained.  I will be making amendments on Committee Stage in respect of the two issues I have indicated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that this Bill is now finally before the House.  As with every action of the current Government, the stable door is being closed after the horse has bolted.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to return to the origins of this legislation.  During the early years of the property boom, there was substantial public concern over the conduct of auctioneers and estate agents.  Instead of addressing this, the Government initially provided for multiple examinations by a variety of different groups to identify what was wrong with our laws and what changes were required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill aims to give effect to key recommendations of the auctioneering-estate agency review group, whose recommendations were published in July 2005.  As described by the Department of Justice and Law Reform, the review group was set up against the backdrop of &ldquo;public concern about certain practices in the property services sector, weaknesses in regulatory and supervisory arrangements and the need to take account of new forms of property services&rdquo;.  The group&rsquo;s report, when published, made the case that there was a need for urgent legislation.  Urgency in this State with Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments apparently results in legislation coming before the D&aacute;il more than five years later than it should.  The Government failed abysmally to put in place the legislative structure necessary to address a series of issues.  Had the legislative structure been put in place to deal adequately with certain problems that were clearly evident in the period 2004 to 2006 some of the thousands of people in this State who made disastrous decisions to purchase property, particularly residential property, might have thought twice before doing so.  Alternatively, they may not have been seduced into doing so by the campaigns run by certain auctioneers and estate agencies on behalf of developers.  Such campaigns were commercially astute but their ethical standards and morality left a great deal to be questioned.  I will return to this issue.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission also produced reform proposals in this area.  In the context of the many difficulties in this area, the commission, in its consultation paper of 2006, referred to <Col N="274"/>an understanding deficit that must be addressed as urgently as possible in the context of consumers dealing with auctioneers and estate agents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The National Consumer Agency recommended in 2006 that legislation to regulate this area should be &ldquo;prioritised in the Government&rsquo;s programme to ensure that it is enacted as a matter of urgency&rdquo; with a view to ensuring &ldquo;early protection for the consumer&rdquo;.  I wonder why "prioritising" and the word &ldquo;early&rdquo; fell on the deaf ears of Ministers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As we know, there is currently no licensing system in place for property management agents.  The code of practice for property service providers in regard to auctioneers and estate agents does not apply to the management agent profession.  It is, of course, welcome that this legislation extends to management agents.  In the context of the construction of a large number of apartments throughout the country, management companies have employed agents to undertake work.  Some agents have undertaken the work extraordinarily well while others can only best be described as having been unfit to undertake such work and as having behaved with gross negligence.  Initially, management agents were appointed by the developers of apartment blocks who controlled exactly what the management agent did.  All too frequently, management agents used annual fees paid by residents of apartments to make good work that developers failed to complete properly to the cost of those who had acquired apartments instead of at the cost of the developer.  The reason was because the management agent was in the pocket of the developer and behaved in that manner in the hope that they would be appointed to manage other further apartment blocks or private housing estates for which the developer was responsible.</P>
        <P>There are welcome provisions in the legislation in so far as there will be an updated legal structure for the licensing of auctioneers and estate agents, dealing with disciplinary issues, when they arise, and issues relating to management agents.  A number of particular provisions in the Bill are welcome.  The Government, of course, is not happy to establish a general whistleblowers&rsquo; charter which might blow the whistle on difficulties in the public sector or within Government Departments or State agencies.  However, it is welcome that there is essentially whistleblowers&rsquo; protection contained in section 67 of the Bill.</P>
        <P>While I welcome various aspects of the Bill, I may table amendments on Committee Stage that may be required to it.  I note the Minister has said he will introduce certain amendments.  I wish to refer to a number of issues of general relevance to this legislation which impact on people outside the House, some of which I do not believe have been adequately or appropriately addressed in the Bill but which could, to great benefit, be addressed in it.</P>
        <P>I will start by making reference to a section the Minister referred to in his speech which deals with the functions of the new property services regulatory authority that is to be established.  The Minister quite properly made reference to section 11 which prescribes the functions of the authority and states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(1) Subject to this Act, the Authority shall control and supervise licensees and maintain and improve standards in the provision by them of property services.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Maintaining and improving standards is a very broad concept.  I have absolutely no doubt that there is a need for better standards as was clearly exhibited during the insane period between 2004 to 2007 until the complete collapse in the property market.  Section 11(1) is a general provision relating to the maintenance of standards, but what perception will be taken of standards and what standards should be maintained is a highly subjective issue.  I wish to draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to certain matters which I believe should be more specifically dealt with in the Bill but, before doing so, I want to refer to section 11(2).</P><Col N="275"/>
        <P Just="Left">Section 11(1) provides the general provision for maintaining standards.  Section 11(2) states &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (1)</i>&rdquo;, but then delineates specific matters the authority may have regard to in respect of dealing with issues of standards.  Section 11(2)(<i>d</i>) states that the authority may specify and enforce standards, including technical standards &mdash; this is reasonably straightforward &mdash; and "appropriate ethical standards" to be observed in the provision of property services, which is a good deal more complicated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What are appropriate ethical standards?  There is something that needs to be said about this area and it is of specific relevance to the property bubble, the collapse of our economy, the profligate behaviour of the banking sector and the silence, to date, on the role played by auctioneers and estate agencies in that.  I do not expect that we will witness a repeat of that disaster for many, many years, but history has a horrible habit of repeating itself.  There was conduct on the part of auctioneers and estate agents, who were acting in cahoots with developers and financial institutions, that can, at the most charitable, be described as immoral and disreputable.  This should have been policed many years ago by Government, it should have been stopped by Government but the Government turned a blind eye.  As a consequence, tens of thousands of people in this country are trapped in negative equity having borrowed funds that should never have been made available to them and which they used to acquire houses and apartments at exorbitant prices for no reason other than the hysteria which developed in the market to which auctioneers and estate agents, by their marketing tactics, contributed substantially and in respect of which the financial institutions and developers aided and abetted.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P Just="Left">To what am I referring?  The House has not yet explored to any great extent the fact that a very small number of well-known auctioneers and estate agents &mdash; I have one particular firm in mind but I will not name it &mdash; appeared, by 2002 or 2003, to have essentially taken control of a substantial portion of the market for the sale of apartments throughout the State.  They organised sales on behalf of developers, who were funded by the financial institutions.  Having funded the developers, they were very happy, either directly or through their subsidiary companies, to put together &ldquo;attractive&rdquo; financial packages to facilitate anything between 90% to 110% loans being made available to purchasers of apartments.  There was no competition because the sale of apartments was orchestrated.  When one estate agent was dealing with a large number of sales, it would orchestrate matters so that on a particular weekend only one launch of apartments would take place in north Dublin.  There would be no competition from other developers in north Dublin.  At the same time, there would only be one launch in south Dublin on the same weekend and this would be heralded in a great fanfare of publicity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When such launches took place &mdash; this also applied to some housing estates &mdash; they said that because of the concerns of the developer, only 20 or 30 apartments or houses would be released for sale.  People in my constituency, who were desperate to buy for fear the prices were about to go up, queued overnight to buy overpriced houses and apartments from developers, which the banks were immorally funding, being sold at prices that could never be maintained.  Due to the fact that the numbers being released onto the market were artificially restricted, a perception was created that they were a rarity as we were heading into constructing 60,000, 70,000, 80,000 and then 90,000 individual units in consecutive years.  We were constructing at a level that was not even remotely required per head of population in our neighbouring countries of England, Scotland and Wales.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Auctioneers were in the centre of this; auctioneers were orchestrating this.  If I am talking about conduct that is unethical or maintaining moral standards, this legislation needs to do a lot more than it does.  It needs to ensure that there is proper competition in respect of the marketing of apartments and houses, as well as commercial buildings.  It needs to ensure that it will be unlawful for an individual company of estate agents in any particular part of this <Col N="276"/>country to orchestrate the release of properties, such as apartments, residential units or houses in an orchestrated, anti-competitive manner in co-operation between developers who should in fact be in competition with each other to the detriment of the consumer.  This legislation does not deal with that.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P Just="Left">Too many people in this country are casualties of what happened on the Government&rsquo;s watch and what did the Government do while all of this was happening?  It formed a committee to examine the issue, which finally produced a report in 2005 and in November 2010 we are debating the legislation in this House.  I believe there should be an inquiry into the conduct of estate agents and auctioneers during the property boom period between 2000 and 2007.  I believe there is a need for an independent inquiry.  I believe there is a need for formal evidence to be taken.  I believe there is a need to examine the practices that applied.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe that developers and financial institutions should be required to explain the arrangements that were put in place whereby financial institutions that were facilitating spiralling land prices, the acquisition of building land at excessive prices through the financial assistance provided by that financial institution and the role played by that financial institution, to ensure the developer paid back the borrowings, guaranteeing anything from 90% to 110% of required finance to residential purchasers.  That helped to fuel the property bubble and auctioneers and estate agents were right in the middle.  They were the conductors of that orchestra and there has been no examination of their conduct to date.  I do not believe that this legislation adequately addresses remotely that particular difficulty and that particular issue.</P>
        <P>I want to put into the record of this House a letter received by me from a constituent of mine dated 31 October.  For the sake of his confidentiality, I am not going to tell the House his name but he is classically the type of individual who is caught by what occurred on the Government&rsquo;s watch.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government in office from 2002 to 2007 should have enacted legislation to put a stop to the type of activities I am talking about.  This is a letter he sent to the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, and he copied it to me.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Dear Taoiseach,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">I am writing to you regarding my situation and that of countless others like me and to find out what your plans are to deal with same.  I appreciate you are busy so I will try to be concise and make my points in bullet form.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Then he does.  He states as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">I had quite a good start in life.  I went to a good school and have an arts degree.  Ever since I have worked in typical white-collar jobs, sales, marketing, etc., plus I have had my own business but never earning very much money.  The most I ever earned was about &euro;45,000 and usually much less, but these days it is closer to &euro;35,000, plus I had a period of six or seven months in 2010 where my earnings veered down to dole levels.  I have always paid my taxes, I have never been on the dole and never had a medical card.  In other words,I have made a decent contribution to society and have never been a drain on it.  I also do voluntary work.  Having bought into Ireland, so to speak, I purchased an apartment in Carrickmines off the plans in 2006.  My purchase price was &euro;340,000 for a tiny one-bedroom apartment.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">There have been various problems on-site as you might imagine, living in a half-finished development with flooded car parks, some antisocial problems and a general lack of funds to manage the development.  Also, myself and everybody on my floor were burgled in 2009 mainly due to the fact that the entrance to our block is in a secluded area.  It was originally <Col N="277"/>envisaged that we would back onto another block, of course never built.  However the biggest problem, it goes without saying, is the catastrophic collapse in our property values.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In the spring of this year they did a highly publicised fire sale of units in our development with the equivalent of my apartment going for &euro;130,000.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I remind the House he paid &euro;340,000 for this apartment into 2006.  He goes on to state:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">That is not even half of what I paid; it is closer to one third.  They could not even sell them at that price.  There was quite a bit of interest but apparently many of the would-be purchasers could not get mortgage approval and since then prices have fallen further, with further falls forecast for 2010 and 2011.  In conclusion, my apartment is effectively worthless and I am mortgaged up to my neck.  It is a massive amount.  I currently owe more than &euro;300,000, paying over &euro;1,400 per month lasting until I am 70 years old.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">As a single person I can&rsquo;t afford my payments on my reduced salary and this is while interest rates are still relatively low, plus I am swamped in debt and sinking further.  If I lose my job I will be in default immediately.  I am still quite young, 38, energetic, willing to work and I try to be positive but it is hard not to think my future is very bleak.  I have literally thrown away over &euro;200,000 worth of equity, will probably never be able to purchase another property and am most likely destined to spend the rest of my life in this tiny apartment.  Please keep me in mind; I only bought the apartment so that I would have a place to live, not as an investment.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I thought it was a responsible thing to do to try to get on the property ladder before I ran out of mortgageable years.  I purchased at the age of 34 but the delay in building my apartment caused by the builder running out of money meant I did not start my mortgage till I was 36.  I can&rsquo;t even emigrate as the rent I would achieve on my apartment would fall considerably short of my mortgage payments and therefore it is unlikely that I would ever be able to afford to have children or become a normal high spending member of society.  Have you considered these specific effects of the property crash?</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">This situation really only affects those who joined the property ladder between approximately 2002 and 2007, that is, it is not a massive number of people in the overall scheme of things.  All those who purchased earlier than that had built up enough equity and those who have not purchased at all will be in the best situation of all, providing they can acquire jobs.  Indeed, people of my generation will be at a huge disadvantage compared to the next generation, saddled as we are with these millstones, massive mortgages on reckless properties.  All of this has had a significantly detrimental effect on my health.  [He goes on to ask the Taoiseach] to consider Peter Bacon&rsquo;s recent suggestion that the Government pay off the negative equity experienced by my generation and therefore free us up to spend more money in the economy and remove some of the despair that is out there.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I have read that letter because we should not ignore the fact that auctioneers and estate agents earned huge sums selling these properties at exorbitant prices and facilitating putting together the financial deals which enabled young men like this constituent of mine to purchase residential units at prices for which they should never have been sold.  There is a great deal more that needs to be done about this but we need to look back at the involvement of estate agents and auctioneers.  We need to amend this legislation to ensure that they operate truly independently.</P>
        <P>I do not believe that auctioneers and estate agents should ever be permitted to be directly involved in facilitating the putting together of financial packages to enable individuals to purchase properties.  That should be left to the individual.  I do not believe that financial institutions that fund developers should be allowed to provide prepackaged finance to facilitate the sale <Col N="278"/>by developers of the constructions, residential or commercial, that have been funded by that particular financial institution.  There is a need to provide clear blue lines or red lines beyond which no one can travel, in the interests of the consumer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to refer to certain other issues.  One of the great difficulties in the area of property is knowing what is the actual value of property.  Putting it into a current context, I read with interest the provision in this legislation to which the Minister referred about the sale or letting of land provisions contained in Part 6 with regard to the "advised market value", and possible difficulties that a totally ethical auctioneer or estate agent may find himself or herself getting into with regard to advised market values that may not be correct.  Will the Minister say how in the current market anyone can advise on the market value of anything in the property area?</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the areas of work in which estate agents and auctioneers engage is rent reviews.  We have already had an amount of talk about commercial leases.  In the area of commercial leases it was the practice for many years that when individuals entered into leases there was provision for upward-only rent reviews.  The legislation that this House passed has addressed that issue for individuals entering into commercial leases from the date the legislation became operative but has not addressed the problem for all of those who currently are tenants and who have commercial leases which preceded the enactment of that legislation.</P>
        <P>There are many businesses located in different parts of the country currently struggling to maintain viability.  A number of them in my constituency, some of them in Dundrum Town Centre, are being confronted by landlords many, but not all, of whom are financial institutions who seek rent reviews in circumstances in which under the lease all one can have is an upward-only rent review.  If they go to arbitration, the arbitrator, as is normally provided for arbitration in these leases, can only accept an upward-only rent review.  An arbitrator may determine that rents should remain as is, but he or she has no remit, jurisdiction or capacity to look at the current market and reduce rents.  This is resulting in businesses closing down, jobs being lost and businesses that could remain viable ceasing to function because of financial pressures created by landlords and financial institutions unwilling to recognise that the market has changed and rents should be reduced.  Some of the landlords, in the context of pension or other funds, are loath to reduce rents because maintaining them at an artificially high level allows them in their annual accounts to present the capital balances in their accounts and the capital value of funds as being greater in theory than they may be in reality. A wise landlord in the current market would be anxious to hold on to a willing tenant, even if the tenant is offering a lesser rent, if that tenant has a good history of making rental payments.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether what has been brought to my attention is accurate, but concern has been expressed to me about this.  I am not saying this is necessarily something any estate agent is involved in.  It may simply be something which some of those who own rented commercial property have been engaged in.  The concern  has been expressed to me that when one goes to rent reviews in an arbitration context, or even if rent reviews result in persons ending up in court, the determining factor is when the arbitrator looks at what are called comparators &mdash; the rent payable for similar properties in similar locations or in the same location &mdash; and relates that rent as a true rent to what the rent should be in the lease being reviewed.  It has been suggested to me that in some parts of the country landlords identify individual commercial tenants who they incentivise to agree a substantially increased rent, in other words, a lease is concluded or a rent review is agreed at a higher rate but there is some secret benefit given to the tenant who agrees to it.  The reason that is happening is that such rent review can then be used as a comparator to force higher rents on a broad range of other tenants in adjacent commercial properties.  If that practice is happening, it needs to be criminalised.  Anyone <Col N="279"/>involved in that should be liable to be charged with a criminal offence and I ask the Minister to look at that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill should provide for the creation of a database of property that is sold and the prices at which it is sold and detailing rental agreements reached and the rents payable so that the general public has a true indicator of the real value of properties and access to information on sales and rents agreed for particular properties.  If there can be that sort of accessible public database in part of the United States, there is no reason we should not have it here.  The United States has the greatest free enterprise economy in the world.  It does not see that as divulging secrets.  It sees that as ensuring there is a real and genuine market and that when people purchase property there is a real indicator of value and price.  This legislation, in the context of dealing with estate agents and auctioneers, should have prescribed the creation of that sort of database, and included within it any changes required or amendments to the Data Protection Acts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The effective regulation of auctioneers and estate agents has been demanded in this House for many years.  A Bill to regulate auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents is long overdue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is remarkable that throughout the boom none of the successive Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments that gorged themselves on property taxes was prepared to move to proper regulation.  A distinguished Member of the Upper House was able to demonstrate that the process required for an auctioneers licence was perfunctory in the extreme.  Provided the applicant could furnish a modest bond there is no test as to his suitability.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il used think of itself as a national movement where auctioneers are an integral part of the infrastructure, somewhere up there with publicans.  As a leading publican said at that famous public meeting that we will never forget, &ldquo;Who does the Government think is running the country?&rdquo;</P>
        <P>For the best part of a decade there has been an even more urgent need to regulate property agents who emerged and multiplied with the arrival of multi-unit developments.  Often these gentlemen were a front for the property developer who built the development.  Acute difficulties for residents have been created in many of these developments but it has taken six or seven years by Government to respond to advocacy for regulation in this House.  In so far as this Bill is part of the answer, I welcome its belated introduction.</P>
           <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I do not particularly blame the Minister.  I am not referring to the fact that this Minister has repeatedly disavowed any familiarity with the property sector and would not know a developer if he met one on the street.  Rather I am questioning the wisdom of abolishing the department of law reform.  The department of justice already has a huge legislative schedule and, in a department so tightly controlled as justice, it may simply be unrealistic to anticipate that sufficient priority would be given to law reform.  Given that Fianna F&aacute;il has been more or less permanently in office, the permanent government has learned how not to displease its political masters.  The result is that control of beggars is accorded a higher legislative priority than regulation of auctioneers who have played a part in beggaring the rest of us.</P>
   
        <P Just="Left">Now the horse has bolted, the Government is responding to boom-time demands.  The Government sat back while bankers, developers and auctioneers colluded to manipulate the market to facilitate profit-taking to such an extent that the crash became inevitable and families have been pauperised.  Disquiet about certain practices in the auctioneering business finally gave rise to a review group being established in 2004.  This was the period over which the then Taoiseach consistently resisted pleas in this House to look at a Kenny report style mechanism to control the price of building land.  Eventually, he kicked to touch and referred the issue to <Col N="280"/>the Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, his excuse or explanation being that arguments on this side of the House that the Kenny report or some of its key recommendations might be implemented posed constitutional difficulties.  The committee concluded, of course, that where the exigencies of the common good required it, there was no such impediment in the way of addressing the cost of building land.  The then Taoiseach did not act and now we are all paying the price.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>The principal proposal of the review group established in 2004 is the establishment on a statutory footing of a property services regulatory authority.  Its purpose would be to control and supervise providers of property services and to improve standards in the provision of those services.  Six years later, the Minister&rsquo;s Bill now reflects that principal recommendation.</P>
        <P>One of the questions that arises is whether we need another agency and elaborate architecture to police a sector currently dormant and unlikely to be over-activated in the years immediately ahead.  Is there no existing agency of State that might be given responsibility for these functions?  For example, might these functions not be reposed in the National Consumer Agency?  It appears to many people that as it stands the National Consumer Agency has few powers and believes it discharges its role merely by advising people to shop around.  If its role is purely about consciousness-raising among consumers on the relative merits of shopping baskets, surely this function could be done to better effect by the national broadcaster?  Why not give the National Consumer Agency some statutory teeth, including the key functions envisaged in the Bill, such as the capacity to earn fees?</P>
        <P Just="Left">More pertinently, I ask the Minister to state, when he is responding to this debate, whether discussions have taken place with the Property Registration Authority to ascertain whether it is in a position to discharge these functions.  It seems the Property Registration Authority would be eminently well-placed to undertake the functions and activities envisaged by the Bill.  I would be pleased if the Minister will indicate if he has considered this option, whether discussions have taken place with the Property Registration Authority, and whether it is the case that the authority already possesses the skill set necessary to discharge the functions envisaged in the Bill.</P>
        <P>It is arguable that the elaborate architecture envisaged by the Bill has its origins in boom times and can be funded only in better times.  Notwithstanding the intention that this new authority will be funded from fees levied on licensees, these questions need to be answered.  Must we really establish a new authority on every occasion that we attempt a needed reform or seek to regulate a professional body?  Perhaps there are circumstances that require precisely such an approach but is this one of them?  Over the past 20 years, the Government has tended more and more to franchise out functions to agencies and quangos while at the same time employing outside consultants to help with the retained duties of a Civil Service diminished in numbers.  Can we afford to continue to govern in this way?</P>
        <P>It is clear that the Ministers clinging to office in this Government are still in the mindset of the profligate days when throwing around money was the formula for retaining power.  It is a mindset that has imperilled our country, yet those responsible behave as though the citizens should be indebted to them for supposedly latterly putting the country before party.  When one talks to people from outside this country, they express disbelief that the same politicians so guilty of undermining our way of life are still in office.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the welcome extension of the licensing system to encompass property management agents and that the residents who are clients of these agents will now enjoy at least some statutory safeguards.  Taken together with enactment of the Multi-Unit Developments Bill, there should belatedly be protections in place for apartment owners, many of whom never anticipated or understood the challenges facing them when they bought into some of these <Col N="281"/>developments.  However, as the Minister is aware, there are a few outstanding important issues awaiting to be addressed on Report Stage of that Bill.</P>
        <P>To most people outside of the House that a person should be deemed fit and proper to discharge the functions of an auctioneer seems an obvious first step.  However, no such requirement as to character has been implemented up to now.  I accept that the Bill envisages that in the future, the authority will enforce a more rigorous regime in this regard.  I look forward to us having the opportunity on Committee Stage to test the adequacy of these provisions.</P>
        <P>I am less clear as to the powers of the authority to intervene where it is suspected that there is collusion and anti-competitive practices being operated by the big players in the estate agency business.  There is no doubt but that the big players in the estate agency business played no small part in artificially inflating property prices during the boom.  Even before the crash, many individual families &mdash; especially first-time buyers &mdash; paid a heavy price for some of the practices engaged in by some auctioneering groups.  Of course, in the vicious spiral that occurred, the big players in the estate agency business fuelled the crisis, and were encouraged and abetted by the broadsheets that profited from property supplements larger than the main newspaper.  In the process, the big players cannibalised many of the small local auctioneers with no beneficial results to the local community.  The developers, the big auctioneering firms, the banks and the newspapers were a heady cocktail that together puffed up the market at the expense of the consumer and ultimately caused the crash that is inflicting such hardship on so many families.</P>
        <P>The Government refused to intervene because, as the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, famously stated, it was not his job to interfere in the market.  It was a statement of such monstrous misjudgment that it will take a generation to recover from the consequences.  The Government did not refrain from extending tax-based property incentives for long beyond their usefulness.  The question that arises for the Minister is whether the new authority will have the power to arrest this type of self-serving spiral of greed.</P>
        <P>Whether or not the Minister wants to proceed with the creation of a new authority as distinct from, as I have suggested, asking the existing Property Registration Authority to discharge these functions, I would like to raise a few questions, mainly in regard to Part 6.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise a few questions with the Minister in respect of Part 6 of the Bill in which attempts are made to regulate licensees regarding the sale or letting of land.  Auctioneers or valuers also provide a crucial function in the fixing of rents at rent review stage &mdash; to which Deputy Shatter referred &mdash; in long-term leases or where the court is asked to fix the term of a new lease where a tenant is claiming statutory rights and is consequently required to fix the rent.  Tenants, including commercial tenants, have little or no confidence in valuers and auctioneers to disclose fairly and candidly all material facts with regard to comparable properties being let in the general vicinity of a premises.  The tenants and the court are dependent on the valuers presenting comparators, that is, details of comparable lettings of which they are aware, for similar properties.</P>
        <P>There should be a mandatory statutory obligation contained in the Bill, in the context of the fixing of a rent in any tenancy, whether it be the initial rent or in a rent review, that the valuer should disclose all material facts in connection with lettings being advanced.  For example, if the valuer is aware that the rent set in a lease he or she is presenting as a comparator to the court has been varied informally or that some other arrangement has come into existence, for instance, a waiver of rent for a period of time or a landlord carrying out works in connection with securing a letting, this should be fully disclosed in a rent review, in any arbitration or in any process where the valuer&rsquo;s expertise is being relied upon.  It should be a specific criminal <Col N="282"/>offence to fail, omit or wilfully refrain from disclosing material facts about any letting, values or terms being presented in support of a rental value for any property.</P>
        <P>Ireland should follow the lead of the UK Misrepresentation Act 1967.  In practice, valuers, estate agents and auctioneers have a monopoly on information and the public are at their mercy as to the market rent for domestic and commercial properties.  This is manifestly not in the public interest and the public have no confidence in the sector to regulate itself.  There is no reason a proper and clear record should not be kept at the creation of each letting agreement of one year duration or longer of crucial data such as the core terms of the letting, for example, the square footage of the property, the intended usage and the rent.  This data could be readily collated and made available to the public.</P>
        <P>Under the Registration of Title Act 1964, leases for 21 years or longer can be registered as burdens and details of their existence can be ascertained and data pertaining to them are submitted to the Land Registry.  Under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform has the power to extend registration to leases that are for less than 21 years.  The greater the transparency and the more readily available to tenants and their advisers the true facts regarding the terms of lettings, the more likely we are to have a fair system of rents and less need for lengthy arbitrations or litigation to resolve disputes with regard to the fixing of the terms of new tenancies.  Litigation and arbitration are costly processes and do not serve the interests of tenants who can often ill-afford the legal and expert fees involved.  Never was this more applicable than today.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shatter has raised the question of rent reviews and I know that the Minister has expressed views on this subject.  I refer in particular to the question of upward-only rent reviews on which a Private Members&rsquo; Bill was introduced by my colleague, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, but the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has not responded positively.</P>
        <P>In the interests of transparency, the Minister should introduce regulations immediately under section 59 of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, facilitating the registration of leases or lettings which are for 12 months or for a greater duration.  The Property Registration Authority is perfectly equipped to deal with this matter.  It has a system in operation for the past 40 years for the registering of leases.</P>
        <P>The expansion of the category of leases to be registered readily facilitates data capture of rent.  The data capture of rent is important, given the number of times Members of this House have received complaints in that regard.  This is critical data which any Government seeking to manage the rights and interests of tenants and landlords needs to take into account as it reveals dynamics and trends in the property industry.  There is no reason the sale prices of properties should also not be published and made available.  This Bill would afford an ideal opportunity to confirm formally the position.  What the public and national interest require at this time is a property price register and a publicly-accessible database.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For an appreciable period of time, the Minister has sought to hide behind the decision of the Data Commissioner that publication of house sale prices would offend the Data Protection Act.  The Data Protection Commissioner operates the relevant legislation including the Data Protection Act 1988.  This Act was amended by the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003, which brought Irish law into line with the EU data protection directive 95/46/EC.  However, in England, details on property sale prices are readily available and the same EU data protection directive governs England as well as Ireland.  Other common law jurisdictions, such as New Zealand, routinely publish sale prices and the information is openly accessible to the public.  If we want to avoid distorting the rent or property market with regard to rent or prices, then the <Col N="283"/>only method of prevention is to publish the actual facts about rents achieved and the sale prices of properties.  The Data Protection Acts should be amended, to the extent that this is necessary, to bring the position into line with other countries, including England and Wales.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, once the legislation is formally amended, data from previous years, particularly from 1 January 2005, should be made available so that the true facts and circumstances about sales of houses, in particular, are available for consideration.  The public have a legitimate interest in having access to the information.  In each conveyancing transaction the Revenue Commissioners acquire a document called a Particulars Delivered document which contains full details of price and so forth.  Therefore, the data is already captured, is held by the Revenue Commissioners and is readily accessible.  What is missing is the political will to facilitate the disclosure of the data.</P>
        <P>The questions I have raised are purely in connection with Part 6 of the Bill.  It is very unlikely that this Second Stage debate will conclude in the near future but I hope the Minister will take time to respond.  We missed out on the ten-year period when this legislation was so badly needed.  I cannot see the point now in rushing to enactment and bringing in an imperfect piece of legislation.  This Bill has its origins in the boom times.  Unfortunately, the market at present does not exist.  The dead hand of NAMA is over all property transactions and, until that matter is stimulated, there will not be any movement.</P>
        <P>The opportunity is there for us to get this legislation right.  However, there is still a reluctance to deal with the kind of issues I have raised in respect of Part 6, including a reluctance on the part of the Minister to do so.  I do not know why this is the case.  Surely, notwithstanding the affinity that exists between the Minister&rsquo;s party, the property industry and the players within it, we must have learned that never again can we inflict this on our country.  The damage which has caused us all to talk about co-operation and consensus to keep the IMF wolf from the door has been provoked because of the mistakes we made in this area.  The Minister must acknowledge there is not just a necessity to admit those mistakes on his part and, in particular, on the part of his namesake, the former Taoiseach, but they must admit we need to address them now.  We have not addressed them, as this Bill stands.</P>
        <P>It is a very elaborate architecture.  I do not know whether the capacity exists in the industry to pay for it.  I am more concerned about the skill set that will be available to the authority to do the job of monitoring, policing, supervision and prosecution, if need be, of bad practice and the kind of manipulation of the market to which Deputy Shatter referred in his earlier remarks.  We all remember it very well.  We all remember the queues, in particular the arranged queues and the manipulated partial sales, as if there was a shortage of land and of houses for sale in the country, and we remember all of these kids who were walked into that by the smooth sales speak of so many commercial professionals.</P>
        <P>It absolutely sticks in the craw now to see some of those beginning to re-emerge onto television and to give us opinions about the economic situation we are now in.  They are crawling out from under the stones again &mdash; the banker economists who told us to party on and buy more houses because the prices were still going up.</P>

Some of them even have the audacity to tell us that they told us so.  They did not.  I am afraid to say that if they had, I do not think the newspapers would have published it.  The newspapers were part of the vicious circle.  They were making huge profits <Col N="284"/>from fat property supplements and they were part of the collusion that went on between the big five estate agents, the newspapers themselves, the bankers and the auctioneers.</P>
        <P>The Minister, six years later, has introduced the Bill to the House.  We ought to take as much time as is necessary to get it right.  There is not a great deal of activity out there at present and we have time on our hands on this one.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  To follow on from some of the earlier comments, I agree with Deputy Rabbitte in regard to the property price register, which we should move quickly towards because it gives certainty within the market, in particular to potential buyers.  I note that Deputy Rabbitte did not comment on the fact work has been ongoing.  I have had occasion to question the Property Registration Authority Ireland, PRAI, when it came to the Committee of Public Accounts two to three months ago, and I am aware work has been ongoing with the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, in that regard.</P>
        <P>A proper register on the sale of properties is something we need to move towards because the difficulty is that uncertainty leads to stagnation in the market &mdash; I speak as one who was a first-time buyer not too long ago, which I will return to shortly.  To take my area of north Dublin, which has the youngest population in the country at an average age of 32.5 years, many people there are looking to get on the housing ladder but are unsure as to whether it is the right time or if there will ever be a right time.  Publishing statistics that are area-specific is a measure I would like to have expedited.  I am pleased work is ongoing but we cannot delay further.  What impressed me about the PRAI was the work it has done in bringing its systems up to speed in this regard, and this is something we need to follow very quickly with legislation.  If that requires amendment to data protection legislation, we should do this as it will assist the whole sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take this opportunity to welcome what I read on the RTE news website today about the agreement seemingly reached today by lawyers for Menolly Homes and the Lagan Group with regard to the pyrite difficulties in my area, as well as in many areas across the country.  I understand the judge has adjourned the case for six weeks to allow for consultation with residents in the affected estates.  Without seeing the full detail of that agreement, it might be an important step forward to give certainty to home owners who, in the main in areas such as Kinsealy, purchased their homes in 2005-06 and now have grave difficulties with their houses.  I give this a guarded welcome.  I want to see the detail of the agreement in the next week in order to discuss it with my constituents and find out how they feel about it.  It might be an important step forward.</P>
        <P>Building control within the State is another area that needs to be examined in great detail.  When developments are finished, there is no point having the building control units of local authorities signing matters off the plans and designs.  The United Kingdom has a very different system whereby inspections take place at each stage of a housing development and are signed off on-site.  This issue has led to some of the problems in my area of north Dublin and I would like the area of building control to be addressed.</P>
        <P>To move to the Bill itself, I would not be nearly as critical as some of the speakers.  It is an important step in the right direction.  We have been crying out for independent regulation of this sector.  The issues are complex, however, and I speak as one who lives in a managed estate. <Col N="285"/> I have had personal experience of dealing with a managing agent in Malahide and, prior to that, with a management company that simply was not up to scratch in terms of the services it was providing.  I see this consistently in my area of north Dublin.  There are managing agents who do their jobs well and work with residents, who are, after all, the owners of the managing company.  This point is often forgotten.  When I meet residents of managed estates, I am shocked by the number of people who do not realise that they themselves own a part of that management company and it is the managing agent&rsquo;s duty to discharge the services on behalf of the owners of that company.</P>
        <P>The problem has been that when an agent is not performing its duties, producing accounts or responding to queries and complaints within an estate but is simply collecting the management fees, this has a vicious circle effect, namely, people withhold their management fees and the services cannot be provided within the estates, which then run into debt.  Those debts are carried by the owners of the company, namely, the residents.  I am specifically interested in the provisions in the Bill for managing agents and a proper authority which will have the teeth to deal with complaints.  In my own area of Malahide, we had to come together as residents to pressure a managing agent to leave. We did not have legal powers to force the agent&rsquo;s departure because the structure of the company was such that its board was controlled by the developer.  That is not a way for people to live in their own communities.  This Bill will ensure that people have recourse to the property services regulatory authority and a compensation fund.</P>
        <P>Heretofore, some managing agents have enjoyed a free lunch.  I do not want to tar all agents with the same brush because I have dealt with individuals who perform their duties extremely well and offer good value for money.  However, under the planning regime that has obtained for the past several years, local authorities have made permission for many housing estates and apartment developments conditional on being managed on a private basis.  In many instances, this was done to allow the local authority to abrogate its responsibility to residents.  I am pleased to note that amendments were brought to the last two Fingal County Council development plans to ensure that housing only developments were not given over to management companies.  This example ought to be followed across the country.</P>
        <P>Under the Bill, the property services regulatory authority will be tasked with controlling and supervising the providers of property services in order to improve standards.  We only have to open any local or national newspaper to read complaints from people who are dependent on managing agents to provide basic services.  The licensing system will cover auctioneers, letting agents and property management agencies and the information collected will be made available to residents to allow them to decide who is best able to look after their estates.  The authority will also have a comprehensive investigative and enforcement function and its scope will extend to property management services.  It will be empowered to appoint inspectors to carry out investigations of licensees either on its own accord or on foot of a complaint.  If a licensee is convicted of an offence under the Act, the court may in some cases revoke all licences he or she may hold and prohibit him or her from reapplying for a licence either permanently or temporarily.  That is a serious sanction which will make people sit up and take their responsibilities seriously.</P>
        <P>The new regulatory regime will be funded by fee income generated by the authority from licences and other services.  We have nothing to fear from regulation.  My previous career was in the independent insurance broker market.  While there has been considerable discussion about the Financial Regulator and the banks, independent financial advisers have moved quickly in response to good regulation and the people who were not doing their jobs properly were weeded out.  This Bill will have the same effect on property management companies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Brien for sharing his time with me and I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009.  There is agreement on all sides of the House that property management has been crying out for regulation.  Anything that streamlines services or makes them more efficient is to be welcomed.  When we speak about small and medium enterprises we regularly call for costs and bureaucracy to be cut.  Costs in the industry will be reduced by changing the licensing of auctioneers from the current court based system to the regulatory regime proposed in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I do not usually like to see new bodies being established or power being taken from Departments but this authority is different because it will not cost the Exchequer anything.  Too many bodies set up in the past did not fund themselves and I do not see any difficulty with an agency being self-reliant.  The fees it generates from the industry will cover its operating costs of &euro;3 million per year.  I assume the big auctioneer firms which have a presence in almost every town and city across the country will pay the lion&rsquo;s share of the fees.  I hope the amount of funding they provide will not give them a disproportionate influence over the authority&rsquo;s activities.</P>
        <P>It was sensible of the Minister to set up an implementation group and a chief executive designate because there is always a lead-in period after legislation comes into force, particularly where a new organisation is being established.  Much of the preparatory work has already been done.  I assume the State is paying the salaries of the individuals involved in the implementation process and I ask whether this expenditure will be recouped when the authority begins to generate its own income.</P>
        <P>The licensing regulations are important because we are all aware of how rapidly the property market developed during the late 1990s and the early years of this century.  Regulations did not develop as rapidly as one would like, however, and it is time that we caught up.</P>
        <P>I am glad property management companies will be covered by the regulations.  While they are more prevalent in Dublin, property management companies operate in every corner of the country.  They have largely been unregulated and, while it is probably fair to say that the vast majority carry out their functions in an exemplary manner, a number do not.</P>
        <P>While the Bill sets out a number of conditions that must be met before a licence is granted, I could not find out how long a licence will last.  One of the licence conditions is that the individual must be tax compliant.  A tax clearance certificate from Revenue is valid for a year but if the licence expires after two or more years, its holder may not be tax compliant for the full duration.  I wonder if there is a mechanism in the Bill to check whether somebody who is not tax compliant is operating under the scheme.  Obviously, that should not be allowed.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about section 44 of the Bill, which relates to letters of engagement.  I am not sure if I have the correct version of the Bill, as passed by the Seanad.  My reading of the section is that when a person employs an auctioneer to sell a house, within a short period of time the auctioneer must set out the agreement or contract between them in a letter of engagement.  What happens if the person employs a second auctioneer, which happens quite often at present?  I assume a second letter of engagement must be issued in such circumstances.  I do not know what prices are being charged, or rates of commission are being earned, by auctioneers at present.  I have very few dealings with them.  One might have agreed rates of commission of 2% or 3% in the letters of engagement with both of one&rsquo;s auctioneers, in addition to the other matters agreed in the letters.  As far as I know, if both of them are involved in the sale of one&rsquo;s house, as things stand the commission is split between the two of them.  Under this legislation, would one have to pay commission to both auctioneers even if one of them had done very little?  If so, one might not be keen to hire a second auctioneer even if that would make it easier for one to dispose of one&rsquo;s property.</P><Col N="287"/>
        <P>I would like to ask a similar question about letting agents.  As far as I can see, anyone who is covered under this legislation must issue a letter of engagement.  Will such a letter be needed if a letting agent rents out a property for as little as &euro;500 a month?  Many letting agents have separate property management companies.  If such a company is managing the renting out of a property, it might be on a commission of 10% of the rent per month, for example.  That would be a small amount of money if the company were involved in renting just one property.  I wonder if this form of bureaucracy is necessary in cases of that nature.  If a property is being rented for a payment below a certain threshold, perhaps the transaction should be exempt from these requirements.</P>
        <P>I welcome section 67, which provides protections for people who report improper conduct.  We are familiar with certain cases, such as the AIB case, that were brought to our attention by whistleblowers.  It happened in F&Aacute;S as well, although I think that was done under a cloak of anonymity.  We have to protect these people.  I welcome the fact that this legislation will offer some protection to people who act in good faith.  Does the authority have the power to ensure such people are not discriminated against?  It is easy to ensure a person is not dismissed, or does not suffer a reduction in salary, but it may be more difficult to prove that a promotion opportunity has been denied.  It needs to be watched.  A simple and clear mechanism should be available to that end.  Will it be possible for the authority to accept an anonymous report from a person who might be worried about being victimised?  A person who works for a licensed operator might be happy to come forward as long as his or her name is not published.  We must protect honest men and women.  Their integrity is invaluable to us.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to have had an opportunity to say a few words on the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009.  I compliment the Minister on its introduction.  I hope it will make its way into law shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a miracle that this Bill has finally appeared in the House.  Even in the context of the Government&rsquo;s track record, the length of time it has taken to appear and, worse still, the false starts that have been associated with it, have been unbelievable.  It is unacceptable that such urgently needed legislation was delayed for five years.  This view has been expressed by many bodies that expected the legislation to be brought before the House before now.</P>
        <P>As a public representative who is familiar with the problems experienced by people throughout Ireland, including my constituents, due to the lack of regulation of the property services sector, particularly with regard to property management agents, I welcome this Bill.  I also welcome it as a licensed auctioneer who has awaited the regulation of this sector.  I do not understand why the provisions of this legislation could not have been adequately dealt with in the Multi-Unit Developments Bill 2009.  If the two Bills could have been brought together in such a manner, as Deputy Rabbitte suggested, it is necessary to criticise the blatant waste of public money and duplication involved in the separate introduction of the provisions of the previous Bill and the Bill before the House.  When will Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party start to save the taxpayer from unnecessary expenditure?  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who is going through his files as I speak, will explain why he felt two Bills were required.  It seems that a single Bill could have covered all of these provisions.  I recognise that the scope of the Multi-Unit Developments Bill 2009 was narrower, but it should have been possible to include all of the provisions under the umbrella of one Bill.</P>
        <P>One of the main provisions of the legislation before the House is to give a legislative stamp to the National Property Services Regulatory Authority.  The authority has been like a toothless dog, in so far as it has snarled occasionally but has had no bite.  The establishment of another quango without legislative power has been another major waste of public money.  It is another <Col N="288"/>example of a Department trying to avoid taking responsibility for something that should be part of its operation.  There is a strong case to be made that the establishment of the authority was a mistake from the outset.  The Law Reform Commission made it clear that there was a sufficient number of regulatory bodies in the public service to implement the new legislation.  The Government, in its wisdom, chose to ignore this recommendation.  It is not surprising that the taxpayer, as always, is bearing the brunt.  The authority has the best office accommodation in Navan, which is an expensive luxury in the absence of a fully stamped role.</P>
        <P>Given that the bottom has fallen out of the property market, one wonders if the authority will ever have a vital role to play.  The once urgent need to regulate estate agents and managing agents does not now seem quite so urgent.  At a time when the regulation of its own operations is under scrutiny, the Government would be well advised to ensure the authority, which has the appearance of nothing more than an expensive quango, does not duplicate the functions of other centralised regulatory bodies in Dublin.  Amalgamation is now the name of the game.  It would be ironic if the authority were to be amalgamated before it had done little more than use up taxpayers&rsquo; money.  This time last year the National Building Agency, the Homeless Agency, the Affordable Homes Partnership and the Centre for Housing Research were amalgamated to cut expenditure.  What price for an authority that has cost millions of euro but has been shackled by the Government&rsquo;s failure to give it legislative power?</P>
        <P>One of the positives of this legislation is that, irrespective of whether the authority survives in the short or long term, it greatly strengthen the interest of apartment owners, which is welcome.  It will also keep a tight rein of management agents whose services and charges have been a source of great anger and conflict.  The matter of management fees must be addressed once and for all.</P>
        <P>Expecting excited first-time buyers to pay management charges before moving into their new properties and refusing to hand over keys until charges are paid has become one of the greatest scams associated with the property market.  Worse still, on many estates in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath, people were expected to pay charges before necessary infrastructure such as public lighting, footpaths and so on was in place.  During the past few years, on many Sundays I have been called to public meetings on such estates where the issue of management fees was criticised.  It needs to be addressed urgently.</P>
        <P>These charges affect house and apartment owners alike.  Evidence suggests there are serious problems regarding apartment complexes and housing estates and many residents feel powerless to address them.  These problems relate primarily to common areas and the failure of builders and managing agents to maintain them while simultaneously charging high management fees that increase each year, often with little or no provision for a sinking fund, which is necessary to cover the high costs that occur every few years when major refurbishment is needed.  Fees can often be higher than two mortgage repayments and residents are often at a loss to know what they are paying for and why.</P>
        <P>As far back as 2002, the Programme for Government had committed to the regulation of management companies but eight years of misery for many have passed without resolution of these problems.  With approximately &euro;1 million per annum poured into the PSRA, it will be more than welcome to see it being given the power to finally function and carry out its brief with full powers to control and supervise licensees and maintain and improve standards in the provision of property services by licensees.  Under this legislation, the authority will be given the power to oversee the issuing and renewal of licences, the establishment and maintenance of a register of licensees, the enforcement of requirements for the issuing an renewal of licences and minimum levels of professional indemnity, the specification and enforcement of technical <Col N="289"/>and ethical standards, the dissemination of information, the establishment and administration of a compensation fund and the development and promotion of codes of practice and conduct.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the authority has developed a code of practice for property service providers, auctioneers and estate agents, which set out the minimum standards to be expected from both.  I was surprised that Deputy Kenneally was wondering whether this was provided for in the Bill.  Not only will the authority take over this function from the Department, it will take over licensing responsibilities from the District Court.  Will the Minister expand on this when he replies to Second Stage?</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the legislation does not solve the problem of ghost estates and the huge empty spaces that stand as the legacy of Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government, although the Progressive Democrats were partly responsible for what has happened and we tend to let them off hook.  Some of its former members are still hovering around the House and they should not be let off the hook regarding the deprivation they have caused for communities and for our society.  This is a legacy of shame that sees the Taoiseach stand as one who has destroyed the historic legacy of his party.  He has shamed the memory of Eamon De Valera and the pride of nationalism.  The replacement legacy was formed on the basis of greed and cronyism.  Many of those involved frequented the Galway tent in the good years and made huge contributions to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  Such misplaced collusion with property developers and speculators has shamed the Taoiseach and his party both at home and abroad.</P>
        <P>The people are left to pick up the pieces of their devastated counties, as is the case in my constituency where ghost estates haunt the landscape.  I attended a meeting only last week with the manager of Westmeath County Council.  One of his directors of services had a list of ghost estates in that county as long as my arm and the position is similar in Longford.  I hope to get further information on this.  Longford is one of the worst hit counties in the State, along with Leitrim and Cavan.  The Government needs to wake up and create an incentive to sell off property on ghost estates.  There is money in the country and we should not be conned about this.  There are people with money but the country lacks hope.  The Government should introduce a scheme for six months whereby stamp duty would not be applied to ghost estate properties.  Many people in Dublin would love to have weekend homes in the midlands and they could maintain those homes.  It would be better than having them lying idle with whin bushes growing in the door.  Some of the estates have been idle for between five and eight years.  A scheme such as this would offer a stimulus to kick-start the purchase of property on these estates.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We have wonderful tourism projects in the midlands and we have a rich heritage.  We have fine rivers and lakes and recently the Royal Canal, which runs from Dublin through my constituency to meet up with the River Shannon at Clondra, was refurbished.  We have many historic buildings, monuments and parks and there are arts centres in Longford, Mullingar and Athlone.  Many customs and traditions are dying but they should be promoted as part of our tourism product.  People whose families moved to Dublin two or three generations ago might like to move back on a weekend basis to see what rural Ireland has to offer.  It has a great deal of offer and it is a great place to live, work and socialise.  Agri-tourism options could also be explored.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The massive overproduction of housing units in counties Longford, Cavan, Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo was fuelled by the misconceived upper Shannon renewal scheme introduced in 1998 by the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, and it was wound down only on a phased basis by his successor, Deputy Cowen.  Blame for the oversupply of housing in these counties rests on both their shoulders.</P>

	<P>I note Deputy Howlin is sharing his time with Deputies Burton and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to share my time with my colleagues.  I am also glad to move this motion on reform in my name and that of the Labour Party Deputies.</P>
        <P>Thomas Jefferson wrote: &ldquo;Government should be judged by how well it meets its legitimate objectives&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Good government&rdquo; he wrote &ldquo;is that which most effectively secures the rights of the people and the fruits of their labour, promotes their happiness and does their will.&rdquo;  On those criteria, the Government we have that has presided over the debacle of our economic collapse is an abject failure.  We will have other occasions to pick over those economic bones, but what we, as a House, must do now is pick up the pieces.  We must set our minds and our focus on restoring the people&rsquo;s confidence in the way that we do the people&rsquo;s business.</P><Col N="293"/>
        <P>The Labour Party has a proud record in this regard.  The last time the Labour Party was in government, we insisted in the negotiations on the programmes for Government on ground-breaking reform legislation, namely, the Freedom of Information Act, the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Electoral Act &mdash; a trilogy of legislation that fundamentally changed the way the public could gain access to information on how they are governed and that introduced transparency into the political electoral systems by having declarations of Members, capping expenditure, disclosure of contributions to political parties and so on.  That is the basis on which the Labour Party looks at the next phase of reform.</P>
        <P>What is before the House is a reform agenda, a major package of 29 individual proposals, each one profound and impactive in and of itself.  It is part of an even larger programme of reform that will be published by the Labour Party shortly.  The aim of the 29 separate proposals is to change the way we run our country and to ensure that every citizen feels a much greater sense of involvement in the decisions that shape their lives.  That is a critical objective to achieve in the face of the disillusionment that has beset our people.  Never has reform been more needed or more urgent.</P>
        <P>The range and scope of the proposals before us are great and far-reaching.  Some require legislation, some require new orders of this House, others require procedural changes in the way the Government handles its business and others require procedural changes in the way that Departments of State function.</P>
        <P>I will take the House through some of the proposals.  One of the proposals is on Cabinet confidentiality.  It was established by a decision of the Supreme Court and it has been partly rolled back but we must ensure that the doctrine of Cabinet confidentiality is not used as a buffer to protect proper inquiry and investigations.  It should be used to allow Government to function but only in so far as it is necessary in the public interest.</P>
        <P>We propose the restoration of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, an Act brought in by a Government of which I was proud to be part.  It has been the most impactive single Act to throw light on the functioning of Government and to allow people access to the minutiae of the decision-making process to ensure that it is done in a way that is truly democratic and open.  Unfortunately, that legislation has been rowed back by the Fianna F&aacute;il administrations and their guises since then.  It is our aim to restore it and to extend it to other public bodies, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is no reason that should not be done.</P>
        <P>We will enact whistleblowers legislation, which is essential.  My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, presented a whistleblowers Bill to this House on more than one occasion.  The argument against enacting it was that we should not have an overarching Bill, that we should introduce it piecemeal in each operation of Government.  It is a great irony that on one occasion when I tabled such an amendment it was defeated by the Government because it does not like the principle of whistleblowing.  We must allow people who work and live in this State where wrongdoing is identified to be able, without fear for their well-being, livelihood or safety to blow the whistle on that wrongdoing.  I mention a current case that of the Irish Red Cross, which was included in a report by Transparency International published in recent weeks.  It is my information that today the whistleblower in that case has been fired.  I understand that he has not even exhausted the internal appeals mechanisms but he was fired today.  That cannot be right.  Somebody who stands up and identifies wrongdoing and causes it to be investigated must have protection and must have the legitimate expectation of protection.  I know a little bit about that from my efforts in the Morris tribunal and the lead up to the tribunal.  I know how difficult it is for a citizen, even an elected Member of this House, when information is given to him or her about wrongdoing to have that fully ventilated and explored.  It should be our objective, as a House, to ensure that is done as a matter of routine and as a matter of course.</P><Col N="294"/>
        <P>One of the proposals we have in the package before the House is to extend spending limits for local and presidential elections in a meaningful way.  Another is to set out not only a register of lobbyists but clear rules of lobbying so that those who peddle influence do it in a way that is understood and open.  Those who are here to have the ears of Ministers or decision makers should be registered in a way that is normal in developed democracies.  Why have we not got such a register?  We talked about it for a long time.  We should work on these issues to restore confidence in the way we do business that the people demand that we do.</P>
        <P>We stated in the proposals we published that we want to make this D&aacute;il more relevant and to give it the capacity to carry out its constitutional duty.  To do that, we need to change the way we do business in here.  We talked about that for a long time.  On the face of it, we have a general consensus that the way we do our business is captured in a bygone age and needs to be fundamentally changed.  We seem incapable of moving forward to bring about this change.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party proposes a number of specific measures in the package set out in the motion.  These form only one element of a series of measures the Government knows must be taken.  We suggest the introduction of a petitions system, similar to that which operates in the European Parliament, to afford individual citizens or groups of citizens access to the legislative body to ensure their genuine concerns can be fully ventilated, examined and, where necessary, addressed.  Given that the model works extremely well in the European Parliament, why not replicate it here?</P>
        <P>We have discussed increasing the number of sitting days in the House.  Let us take this step and allow each Member to be placed on an equal basis by turning the House into what it should be, namely, a real Legislature.  Every Member knows that only the Government can generate legislation that has any prospect of ending up on the Statute Book.  That has been my experience in the House with very few exceptions.  It is wrong that the perception has grown that the people who make laws are the Government.  This is not supposed to be the case.  Under the separation of powers, the body charged with making laws is the Oireachtas, namely, the D&aacute;il, Seanad and, ultimately, the President.  However, the vast majority of Members are unable to have a meaningful input into the creation of legislation.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party proposes that there would be a set day every week for Private Members&rsquo; legislation.  Such legislation would be encouraged by the Government because there is a myriad of issues for which the Government will never get around to legislating.  Some are important for the nation, while others are important for sections of the community.  They should be debated in the House and each individual Member should have the capacity to introduce such legislation.  The House should be able to resource this activity through the Library and Research Service.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party proposes to restrict the use of guillotine motions and fundamentally change the manner in which legislation passes through the House.  The measures proposed in the motion have been discussed <i>ad nauseam</i>.  They include publishing the heads of Bills in advance, inviting interested parties to the House to give evidence to committees, using the Chamber for this type of debate and having committee weeks where such debates could take place in open session.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party proposes to give a new role to the Ceann Comhairle.  How often do Deputies feel insulted by answers they receive to parliamentary questions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Many are non-answers.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="295"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have seen answers from the Department of Education and Skills, with which Deputy Quinn will be familiar, which advise the relevant Deputy to consult the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I received two such replies today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a way to deal with elected Members of Parliament.  If the Oireachtas is the constitutional body charged with holding the Government to account, as is our solemn constitutional duty, the Executive must respect this role.  Why would it do so if we do not assert these rights?  These matters are fundamental to having a functioning Parliament.  The Labour Party proposes that where, in future, non-answers or insulting, inadequate or evasive answers are provided, the Ceann Comhairle will have a role in determining that the relevant Minister failed to provide reasonable information in reply to a question and require him or her to answer the question.  I know from my role as Leas-Cheann Comhairle that Members are at the mercy of Ministers and, more especially, officials in the Departments.  Decisions are frequently made by senior officials, without reference to a Minister, to disallow questions that are in order.  They seek ways to disallow questions, debates and Adjournment matters.  This should not occur if we are to have a functioning Parliament that holds the Executive to account as the Constitution requires.</P>
        <P>The motion proposes empowering Oireachtas committees to deal effectively with matters of public expenditure, including value for money issues.  The range of proposals in this area is complicated and I do not have time to discuss them in detail.  We must do this, however, because it cannot be the role of the House to always look backwards to see what awful mistakes have been made.  The House must dip into expenditure on a current basis to ascertain not only whether it has been spent in the manner voted by the House, but also that it is spent effectively and efficiently.</P>
        <P>Another of our 29 proposals addresses the profound matter of the aftermath of the Abbeylara judgment.  Since the judgment in the Abbeylara case &mdash; I confess that I was a member of the relevant sub-committee &mdash; the House has backed off taking any investigative role.  The Committee of Public Accounts, the only committee of the House that has teeth, has also backed off making any overt criticism of any official because the spectre of Abbeylara hangs over the way in which the House does its business.  This is wrong and the judgment must be rolled back.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas is the only Parliament in the world that I have studied &mdash; I have also asked the Library and Research Service to examine other parliaments &mdash; which does not have the power to investigate and find matters of fact.  It is astounding that this level of impotence is tolerated in a functioning Parliament, yet we do so.</P>
        <P>Addressing the Abbeylara judgment may ultimately require constitutional change.  If that is the case, we must make the necessary change but let us first draft legislation to test the limits of the current constitutional position.  I do not believe the very narrow interpretation the House has placed on the Abbeylara judgment to spancil its work was intended in the majority decision in the Abbeylara case.  The matter must be put right.</P>
        <P>Taken together, the proposals before us would change the way the Oireachtas works, make it more effective and give people confidence that we can hold the Executive and others to account and do business effectively.</P>
        <P>On a wider government scale, the Labour Party proposes the complete reform of the annual Estimates process to make it more timely and relevant.  It is proposed, for example, to accompany the Book of Estimates with a detailed performance report on what the previous year&rsquo;s expenditure has achieved.  Currently, one is given a list of figures for the current year <Col N="296"/>and a further list for the forthcoming year.  One then compares the two lists to determine what changes have been made.  Questions are not asked about what money was spent on, whether it achieved success, if the outcomes were those intended or whether the entire sum was expended on the purpose for which it was allocated.</P>
        <P>Earlier, the T&aacute;naiste answered questions on how much of the allocation for the capital programme of the Department of Education and Skills had not been spent and the House discussed ways in which the outstanding amount could be spent.  This is a hopeless approach to dealing properly with public accounts.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party proposes the establishment of an independent fiscal advisory council to perform a monitoring function and provide accurate projections.  This would enable Members to rely on independent projections of the macroeconomic position to make important decisions.</P>
        <P>We propose to appeal the gagging clause to enable senior officials to express their views on Government policy.  Why should we not allow them to do so?  Most important, we propose to replace the Ministers and Secretaries Acts and Public Service Management Act with clear legislation &mdash; this is extremely important &mdash; to set out the functions, powers and duties of Ministers and every official in order that there will be clear lines of accountability and no more talk of systemic failures.  Nothing is a failure in this country; the system always fails but nobody makes a cock up or mistake.  We need to have accountability for Ministers, Ministers of State and senior officials.</P>
        <P>Taken together, this package of measures, which will be part of a much wider package the Labour Party will publish, will change the landscape of public administration in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the past, Oppositions always have sought change and Governments always wanted the <i>status quo</i>.  The Labour Party commits itself to profound and meaningful change now, with a real prospect of Government into the future.  At a time of crisis for his country and his presidency, Abraham Lincoln stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" Just="Left">The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">One shall see tonight and tomorrow whether this House is ready for the challenge of change.  However, reading the Government&rsquo;s pitiful amendment that promises more but delivers nothing gives me little faith.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Howlin, on putting together what is a highly ambitious but realistic programme of reform.  Ireland faces a number of crises.  Clearly, it has an appalling banking crisis in which the losses in the banks have been socialised whereas in the preceding years, all the profits in the banks were privatised.  Ireland has a crisis with regard to employment and its economy, as well as in respect of its public administration of institutions such as the HSE.  However, greater than all the other crises and, in a way, the talisman of the different crises from which it suffers, Ireland has a crisis of reputation.  People, whether Irish-Americans or Europeans, who once openly admired Ireland now no longer believe much of what is said.  This is because from the time the banking and economic crisis started to unfold three years ago, the Government, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister, Brian Lenihan, in particular,  repeatedly stated that we were turning a corner, that everything would be all right or that we were out of the difficulty.  Ireland has shredded the confidence of international investors and of the bond markets, which are particularly tough with regard to reputational issues, because it is perceived to be a country without an adequate system of governance.  When everything is going fine, people are prepared to accept a narrative to the effect that this is something to do with the Irish character or Irish style of life or that <Col N="297"/>the Galway tent is funny, enjoyable and a bit of craic.  However, when the economic position turns as it has done, people take a very hard-nosed attitude to our reputation, which is shredded.  This ambitious programme of reform seeks the placing of a clear stamp by a new Government.  Only a new Government can do this because of all the reputations that have been shredded, that of Fianna F&aacute;il probably is more damaged than any other institution in the country.  However, one can start again with a new Government with an ambitious programme of reform.</P>
        <P>Today marks the 20th anniversary of the election of Mary Robinson as the first female President of Ireland.  One factor that marked her successful contest for the office of President was that in many ways, she spearheaded the hopes of a generation that things in Ireland could be different, that we could open out to the light, could end the climate of censorship and repression and could have much more public governance.  As Deputy Howlin has stated, during its last period in government the Labour Party introduced a number of key legislative reforms on freedom of information, the regulation of elections and in respect of a restriction on fundraising and the amounts of money that could be contributed to politicians during an election, as well as with regard to a number of other offices.  Essentially, a new Government will be obliged to readdress all these issues.  Other than for personal requests, freedom of information was pretty much closed down for public requests by means of a much longer, more tedious and more expensive process by a carefree Charlie McCreevy.  In a manner similar to his proposals on decentralisation, he regarded the gutting of the Freedom of Information Act as offering two fingers to those who were prissy and who only cared about standards.  It was an case of &ldquo;Here is one in the eye for you; when I have it I spend it&rdquo;.  He was delighted to give two fingers to the Labour Party and to voices in civil society who recognised the value of freedom of information legislation.</P>
        <P>I have made many freedom of information requests in my time and note that such requests now are highly expensive, as one is charged large amounts of money by the Department of Finance and other Departments.  One request I have made consistently in recent years has been to get access to the papers and documents surrounding the night of the fatal and fateful bank guarantee.  Although I have had success with small amounts of information, three years into the greatest financial crisis this country has ever known, essentially we still are no wiser.  I wish to make specific reference this evening to a number of remarkable articles that appeared in two leading newspapers last weekend.  One, which appeared in Saturday&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, was by Bruce Arnold, a highly respected journalist who has a long record of exposing matters of public interest in Ireland.  The other article was by Senan Moloney and Jason O&rsquo;Toole and appeared in the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i>.  This is the reason a restoration of freedom of information legislation is required because essentially, the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i> article suggests that from late 2007, Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, the former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, was a member of or was attached to what both articles described as a kitchen cabinet run by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in the run-up to his expected elevation as the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  The information is described as having been given by a former highly senior figure in Anglo Irish Bank who clearly was both a senior director and senior executive.  Bruce Arnold stated &ldquo;Cowen knew that the fiscal roof was falling in when, as Finance Minister... he involved himself in the Anglo Irish Bank crisis, setting up a kitchen cabinet&rdquo;.  The same remarks are made in the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i>.  Moreover, the latter newspaper again reported on the famous dinner, about which all Members have heard and that features in a number of books, that took place in Heritage House in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  I refer to a private dinner with the Taoiseach-elect in April 2008, who at that point was the heir to the leadership of Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Why must Members be obliged to rely on an unattributed source in two leading newspapers about the most expensive decision in the history of the Irish State or the connection of that <Col N="298"/>decision to the investment or to the gambling in contracts for difference by Se&aacute;n Quinn?  I recall that when I mentioned Se&aacute;n Quinn some years ago in this House, I was accused of not wearing the green jersey.  Indeed, a former director of another institution has stated that the aforementioned green jersey agenda was the essential agenda pursued by the regulator, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and others who must have and should have been aware that Anglo Irish Bank was a bust institution.  Ireland now faces a financial crisis of unprecedented proportion.  However, unlike almost any other democratic state or European Union member state, not a single banker has been made accountable before the courts of the land.  Moreover, not a single banker has even appeared before a joint committee to do as did Fred the Shred, that is, Sir Fred Goodwin, in the United Kingdom, who at least had the grace to apologise to the country for what he had done while in charge of his bank.  How does the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, expect the international bond markets to believe a word out of the mouths of Ministers when this information seems to be available around the world, and it now emerges that various brokerage houses in the United States and London knew all about the contracts for difference of Se&aacute;n Quinn?  It was for that reason that the share price of that bank collapsed on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day 2007.  The Taoiseach clearly knew then.</P>
        <P>If we had a Freedom of Information Act we would have established this a long time ago.  We have a Freedom of Information Act that drip-feeds information, as Fianna F&aacute;il drip-fed bad news this year about the banks.  The fact that we will not tell the people the truth is damaging, not just to the people of Ireland but incredibly financially damaging to Ireland.</P>
        <P>With a new Government, the people deserve to learn the truth.  The proposals put forward by the Labour Party will give the people the right to learn the truth about the calamity they are paying for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Howlin and Burton for the opportunity to contribute to the debate at this point.</P>
        <P>The economic crisis has led to a widespread debate not only about the nature of the Irish economy but also about how we are governed.  There is justifiable anger among the people at how successive Governments they elected have so misgoverned and mismanaged this State that they have brought us to the brink of bankruptcy.  A true democracy and a true Republic would instil confidence in people that we can and will solve our problems and move forward, but this State and the political system, as shaped by the two dominant conservative parties, has undermined that confidence and created disillusionment and cynicism.</P>
        <P>Without question, we need to fundamentally reform the way we govern ourselves.  However, let us be under no illusion.  Successive Governments have acted in the way they have because they have represented, not the majority of the people who elected them, but the privileged minority which controls wealth in this State.</P>
        <P>One statistic tells the whole story.  One per cent of people in this State control 20% of the wealth.  That speaks of a distorted economy but it also speaks of a distorted democracy.  The two cannot be separated.</P>
        <P>We need fundamental economic reform as well as political reform.  Real democracy is the key to both.  The people must be sovereign and as the Democratic Programme of the first D&aacute;il states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The Nation&rsquo;s sovereignty extends not only to all men and women of the Nation, but to all its material possessions, the Nation&rsquo;s soil and all its resources, all the wealth and all the wealth-producing processes within the Nation, and ... we reaffirm that all right to private property must be subordinated to the public right and welfare.</P><Col N="299"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Programme also states a principle that should underpin all efforts at democratic reform:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">We declare that we desire our country to be ruled in accordance with the principles of Liberty, Equality and Justice for all, which alone can secure permanence of Government in the willing adhesion of the people.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies endorse the programme of reform set out in the Labour Party motion.  Many of the proposals echo those we have also advanced.  The main focus of the reforms in the motion is the accountability of the Government to the Oireachtas and to the people.  That accountability has been shredded in the past decade and a half.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s regard for democratic accountability was shown in its refusal to hold the Donegal South West by-election until forced to do so by the High Court judgment in the case taken by Sinn F&eacute;in Senator Pearse Doherty.  That refusal was for reasons of pure political expediency.  It says much about the political malaise in this State that no Government had the integrity to introduce legislation to make by-elections mandatory after a set period had elapsed from the creation of the vacancy.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in would go much further than the proposals in this motion.  We would see all of this in the context of the need to move towards Irish re-unification and to prepare the ground for an all-Ireland democracy.  We would stress the need to increase the representation of women in politics.  We would emphasise the need to respect the decisions of the people in referendums &mdash; a principle that was violated in both the second Nice treaty and Lisbon treaty referendums.</P>
        <P>At the MacGill summer school this year Senator Pearse Doherty set out our views on the need for political reform.  I wish to re-emphasise some of those points.  The political culture we have is the one created by the political class who have held power since the foundation on the State. They are the architects of a system that protects their own interests and the interest of an elite at the top of Irish society.  Laws that have their foundation in the outdated 1937 Constitution do not protect the rights of children nor the socio-economic rights of citizens.  Our electoral system and the Oireachtas are not fit for a modern democracy.  The electoral system has given us an Oireachtas that is largely male, middle class and hardly even middle-aged.  It is not surprising that it is so unrepresentative.  Many people have no engagement whatsoever with our electoral system.  They are not on the electoral register and they do not vote.  Those most estranged from our electoral system and from politics come from the most disadvantaged communities in the State.</P>
        <P>Any reform to our political system must have as one of its first objectives to increase the participation of citizens, particularly those who currently do not participate, in the political process at all levels from voting to holding office.  Getting on the electoral register should be simple and straightforward.  PPS numbers should be used to avoid fraud, rather than putting hurdles in the path of those seeking to get on the register, as is the case currently.  The process needs simplification, with automatic renewals of registered voters for starters.  An independent electoral commission should take on this task rather than leave it to each local authority as is the case at present.  An electoral commission could take on the task of voter education on elections. The most critical task of such a commission should be to increase turnout and numbers contesting seats at all tiers of representation.  All elections should be on weekends to increase participation, with two-day polling considered.  Voting age should be reduced to 16 and consideration should be given to reducing the age at which a person can run for the D&aacute;il from 21 to 18.  We need to do this to get more young people engaged in politics.</P>
        <P>Irish citizens living outside the jurisdiction should be given the right to vote, as is the norm in most modern democracies &mdash; 115 countries to be exact.  We need a radical overhaul of the electoral process in order to ensure that there is both a more democratic expression on the <Col N="300"/>part of the population, including on an all-Ireland basis, and that the actual elected institutions are made more representative of the popular will.</P>
        <P>Proportional representation should be strengthened through the introduction of larger, multi-seat constituencies. This would mean that the minimum number of seats in any constituency would be increased to five.  That would ensure a much more accurate representation of parties based on their percentage vote in contrast to the current system that favours the largest parties, especially in three and four seat constituencies.  There should also be an examination of how the party list system operates in other countries with consideration given to using such a system to elect a proportion of the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>We need to strengthen the role of Parliament.  The D&aacute;il can be made more effective.  Small changes could empower the Opposition to be more effective and to make the D&aacute;il more relevant to the lives of ordinary people.  The D&aacute;il needs to play a stronger role in holding the Government to account.</P>
        <P>We need the D&aacute;il to be much more spontaneous than it is at present. There should be big changes in terms of how legislation is brought through the Oireachtas and how the committees work.  Committee chairs should be allocated proportionately, based on party strength and should not have any additional financial reward attached to them; they should not be a reward for loyal backbenchers of whatever party is in Government.  Committees should also be given investigative powers, and there should be an obligation on the Government to consider proposals put forward by a committee.</P>
        <P>Taking the fixation with local issues out of parliamentary elections cannot happen if there is a not a parallel reform and empowerment of local government in Ireland.  Addressing the warped political culture in this State will require a radical shift that seeks an end to cronyism and the privileged position enjoyed by an elite.</P>
        <P>We may not have a body of established lobbyists in the State, but what we have is something more insidious.  We have politicians who are, in many cases, too close to those whom they are meant to regulate.   Rewarding those close to oneself with positions on State boards, moving Departments to one&rsquo;s constituency, and ensuring sports clubs in one&rsquo;s constituency get a disproportionate share of funding when one is Minister are all examples of cronyism at work.  Over recent years, we have had Government politicians too close to the property developers, property developers too close to bankers, and bankers too close to the regulator.  Is it any surprise we are in the mess we are in?</P>
        <P>After the 2007 general election, we saw a person who had been a Minister of State move straight to the head of the Construction Industry Federation.  We need rules that prevent people making moves straight from Government to the heart of bodies trying to wield influence over Government policies.  I welcome the clause to this effect in the Labour Party motion.</P>
        <P>There needs to be an end to the circumstances in which positions on State boards are doled out as rewards to supporters of whatever party happens to be in government.  There needs to be a cull of quangos and unelected bodies to cut back on waste and improve transparency and efficiency in decision making.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Members will support the motion enthusiastically when it is put to the House.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party motion covers a very wide range of areas, from transparency and D&aacute;il reform to changes in the budgetary and Estimates processes and reform of the public service.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Government has been active in many of these areas and that there are commitments in the renewed programme for Government dealing with many of the remainder, while in some cases action would not seem to be required.  The salient points are set out in the Government&rsquo;s counter-motion which I have moved.</P>
        <P>Before dealing with the specifics of the Labour Party motion, it is proper for me to remind the House that there is already a substantial framework of legislation in place, much of it dating from recent years, that lays down rules about the standards that should apply in public office, management and accountability in the public service, transparency in the operation of public bodies and limits that apply in elections.  I say this because, in dealing with specific ideas for change, we risk losing sight of the fact that there is a network of provisions in place that reflect the importance of underpinning high standards of behaviour, performance and accountability.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party motion begins with the issue of Cabinet confidentiality.  The purpose of Cabinet confidentiality is to ensure Ministers can have full and open discussions at the Government table, and it is an important aspect of the collective responsibility for Government decisions enshrined in the Constitution.  I presume Deputies will be familiar with the constitutional provision on Cabinet confidentiality inserted by the people as recently as 1997.  Article 28.4.3&deg; of the Constitution provides that the confidentiality of discussions at meetings of the Government is to be respected in all circumstances except where the High Court determines that disclosure should be made in respect of a particular matter in the interest of the administration of justice by a Court or by virtue of an overriding public interest pursuant to an application by a tribunal appointed on Oireachtas authority to inquire into a matter of public importance.  Cabinet confidentiality is not absolute. The High Court may decide that it should be lifted in the interest of the administration of justice by a court or by virtue of an overriding public interest identified by a tribunal.  It is clear, therefore, that the Constitution provides that Cabinet confidentiality cannot be used to cover up investigations, as may be implied in Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s motion.</P>
        <P>The Government does not support the Labour Party motion&rsquo;s proposal to overturn key provisions in the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003.  These provisions were intro<Col N="303"/>duced to ensure the appropriate balance between facilitating public access to information and the proper functioning of Government.  More than 500 bodies are covered by the Act.  The Department of Finance keeps its coverage under regular review.  A number of bodies have been identified as being suitable for freedom of information coverage and the Department of Finance is working on proposals for an extension of the Act to these bodies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It should not be for the Department of Finance to decide on these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>The renewed programme for Government sets out that the application of the Freedom of Information Act will be expanded to include certain administrative matters in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The freedom of information central policy unit in the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice and Law Reform have set up a working group that is examining the various issues and challenges relating to extension of the Act to these specific administrative functions.  The group will produce a report that will identify administrative functions for freedom of information coverage together with recommendations and an implementation plan for approval by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>The motion also calls for the introduction of whistleblowing legislation.  In the course of the preparation of Bills, Ministers are required to include whistleblowing provisions, as appropriate, having regard to the nature, purpose and scope of the legislation in question.  Various Acts in recent years have contained such provisions, including the Health Act 2007, the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007, the Labour Services (Amendment) Act 2009, the Chemicals Act 2008, the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, and the Charities Act 2009.  Whistleblowing provisions have been included in various Bills before the Oireachtas, including the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008, the Employment Agency Regulation Bill 2009, the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009, and the Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill 2010.</P>
        <P>The Government remains of the view that the sectoral response to affording protection to employees through the inclusion of appropriate whistleblowing provisions is the appropriate policy.  Where a horizontal approach has been appropriate, however, the Government has moved to apply it.  The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2008, which deals with the offences of bribery and corruption as set out in the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2005, deals with whistleblowing in respect of bribery and corruption on a horizontal cross-sectoral basis.  The Bill has been amended on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il specifically to include whistleblower protection in respect of bribery and corruption under the Prevention of Corruption Acts.  These provisions apply to any person reporting an opinion that an offence under the Protection of Corruption Acts has been committed.  The provisions apply to a possible report in respect of a very wide variety of persons and include any person employed by or acting on behalf of another, or any person employed by or acting on behalf of the public administration of the State.  In effect this means a person employed in any sector, including the public sector, who suspects that an offence covered by the prevention of corruption legislation is being committed and reports that suspicion, will be protected in respect of that report from liability in damages arising from that communication, assuming it is made in good faith and is neither frivolous nor vexatious.  The whistleblower provisions in the Bill have been drafted with the intention of ensuring protection for the whistleblower and of clarifying the rights of redress open to an individual who may be penalised, by an employer for example, as a result of having reported a suspicion.</P>
        <P>The motion also calls for the introduction of a programme of reform that would include spending limits for local and presidential elections and a reduction in the ceilings for European <Col N="304"/>and general elections.  It should be noted that legislation to provide for spending limits at local elections was put in place by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2009.  Election spending limits applied for the first time at the local elections held in that year.  The spending limits range from &euro;7,500 to &euro;15,000, depending on the population within a local electoral area.  The Electoral Act 1997, as amended, provides for spending limits at general, European and presidential elections.  The expenditure limits are known to Members of the House.  Consideration is being given to approaches to effect changes to provide for further controls on political donations and political funding.</P>
        <P>In reforming Ireland&rsquo;s system of political funding, there are a number of issues concerning the transparency of current funding arrangements that need to be considered.  In particular, recommendations have been put forward by the Council of Europe Group of States Against Corruption in its report on party funding in Ireland, published in January 2010.  Recommendations have also been made by the Standards in Public Office Commission.</P>
        <P>Regarding the regulation of lobbyists, the renewed programme for Government states the Government will &ldquo;introduce a Register of Lobbyists, including professional, corporate and NGO&rdquo;.  It is accepted that lobbying is a legitimate activity.  Concerns have been and will be raised, however, as they have been raised in this debate, as to whether undue influence is being brought to bear.  Effective measures to enhance transparency and accountability and reinforce a healthy culture of integrity in lobbying, while avoiding undue compliance costs on the political and administrative systems and on lobbyists should be proceeded with.</P>
        <P>Internationally, the issue of regulating lobbyists has increased in prominence.</P>
        <P>The policy challenge for Ireland is to ensure the system of regulation is appropriate to national circumstances.  A viable system of regulation must bring tangible benefits in transparency, must fit well with public expectations of access and with the specifics of our political system and must not present an unnecessary drain on public resources to administer, particularly in circumstances such as those which currently obtain.  The appropriate regulation of lobbyists, including the question of the introduction of a register, is being considered by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who intends to bring proposals to Government on the matter in due course.</P>
        <P>In the context of State boards, the appointment of the board members of statutory agencies and public bodies has traditionally been a matter for the Minister under whose aegis the relevant body falls.  However, the method of appointment is often set out in the legislation governing the body and ministerial freedom is not unfettered.  Account must be taken of specific legislative requirements, such as that relating to the appointment of worker directors or representatives of nominating bodies and also of relevant Government policies, such as that which comprehends gender balance on State boards.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware that changes to the process have been piloted in a number of areas.  Legislation brought forward by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources provides that a proportion of appointments to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and RTE would be made by the Minister, having regard to the recommendations of the relevant Oireachtas joint committee.  The legislation under which the new inland fisheries authority &mdash; Inland Fisheries Ireland &mdash; was established provides a similar role in respect of some of the board appointments.  While it properly remains the prerogative of the responsible Minister under whose aegis a particular body falls to make appointments, there can be no doubt of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to the reforms that are under way.</P>
        <P>Following the reform of F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s governing statute by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the legislation now sets out in detail the skills mix required on the board of <Col N="305"/>that organisation.  In the case of NAMA, the relevant Minister sought expressions of interest from suitably qualified people for appointments to the board.  The Minister for Transport invited expressions of interest for appointments to the Dublin Transportation Authority.</P>
        <P>These processes have extended the pool of candidates from which appointments can be made.  However, the experiences relating to the processes to which I refer have given rise to a number of resource issues and to some challenges relating to the expansion of those processes.  It is becoming clear that the logistical requirements for implementing changes to the process of public appointments to State boards must be thought through, not least because of the time commitment involved and the demands of the selection process.  Calling for expressions of interest certainly opens up the process.  However, the time demands are greater and the manner in which all or some stages of selection might be conducted in public or otherwise requires careful examination, particularly in light of the risk of deterring suitable candidates who would demand a level of confidentiality concerning their candidature.</P>
        <P>The Public Appointments Service is available to assist, where necessary, in such processes and there is a level of ongoing consultation in respect of the matter.  In the interim, a perusal of the annual reports of State bodies &mdash; in which details relating to board members and their qualifications are set out &mdash; will bear testament to the high calibre of appointments that have been made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards D&aacute;il reform, proposals agreed by the Government last year were brought before the relevant forum of the D&aacute;il Committee on Procedure and Privileges, namely, the Sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform.  These proposals included more sitting days, consolidating the time that the Taoiseach and Opposition leaders spend in the House, commencing D&aacute;il proceedings earlier each day and dealing with the current position relating to promised legislation only once a week.  I am of the view that these proposals would enable the D&aacute;il to be more reactive to issues which are newsworthy on any given day.  This would be additional to the opportunity in this regard which Leaders&rsquo; Questions, in particular, affords Opposition leaders in the House.</P>
        <P>Consensus has not so far proved possible on the Government&rsquo;s proposals.  However, I understand the Chief Whip is continuing his engagement with the various party representatives on the sub-committee with a view to achieving the highest possible level of cross-party consensus in respect of them.  We all share the view that there is a need to reach agreement on a set of procedural reforms and we look forward to this being achieved in the coming period.</P>
        <P>With regard to outside appointments, rules to ensure that former senior civil servants and special advisers do not work in an area involving a potential conflict of interest are already in place in accordance with the code of standards and behaviour which was introduced in the Civil Service in September 2004.  The code was drawn up and promulgated by the Minister for Finance under the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, and was published by the Standards in Public Office Commission and issued by the Department of Finance as a circular.  The outside appointments board is an independent body established under the code in 2005.  Its purpose is to provide independent scrutiny of employments which former civil servants propose to take up within one year of retiring or resigning from the Civil Service.  The board is comprised of a non-Civil Service chairman, the Secretary General with responsibility for public service management and development in the Department of Finance, the Secretary General to the Government and two other non-Civil Service members.</P>
        <P>In line with a commitment in the renewed programme for Government, the provisions of the code of conduct for civil servants in respect of the acceptance of outside appointments and of consultancy engagement following resignation or retirement will be extended to all public servants in designated posts.  This will ensure that such individuals will not &mdash; within 12 months of resigning or retiring from the service &mdash; accept an offer of appointment from an outside <Col N="306"/>employer, where it is deemed to create a conflict of interest, or accept an engagement in a particular consultancy project, where the nature and terms of such appointment or engagement could lead to a conflict of interest, without first obtaining approval from the outside appointments board.</P>
        <P>The final part of the Labour Party&rsquo;s motion relates to the roles and responsibilities of Ministers and Secretaries General.  It is important to maintain an appropriate balance between the two in respect of policy and administration.  This issue was addressed in the Public Service Management Act 1997, which formed a key element of the drive under the strategic management initiative to improve performance and accountability.</P>
        <P>Secretaries General have the twin tasks of delivering policy advice to Ministers and undertaking a range of management duties.  It is the responsibility of Ministers to determine policy and the outputs required to deliver thereon.  Under the Act, Secretaries General must manage their Departments, implement Government policies appropriate to their Departments, monitor Government policies which affect their Departments and deliver outputs as determined with the relevant Minister.  Specifically, they must prepare and submit to Ministers strategy statements relating to their Departments and provide progress reports to Ministers on the implementation of those statements, either annually or at such intervals as the Government may direct.  They must also provide advice to Ministers on any matter affecting or connected with the responsibilities of their Departments and ensure appropriate arrangements that will facilitate an effective response to matters that pertain to Departments and other parts of the public service are put in place.</P>
        <P>Secretaries General must also ensure the resources of Departments are used in a manner that is in accordance with the requirements of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 and examine and develop means that will improve the provision by Departments of cost-effective public services.  In addition, they must assign responsibility to other officers of their Departments.  Officers to whom responsibility for the performance of functions has been assigned are to be accountable for the performance of those functions to the Secretaries General.</P>
        <P>In the context of the reform of the Estimates and budgetary process, the Government put in place a special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, chaired by Mr. Colm McCarthy, to examine every area of Government expenditure in a critical manner.  The group&rsquo;s report, which proposes specific savings measures of &euro;5.3 billion and a reduction in numbers of 17,300, was published in July 2009.  The Government has moved to implement many of the measures recommended in the report and continues to have regard to its proposals, particularly in respect of structural reforms in the system of public administration generally.</P>
        <P>The Government has progressively reformed the system relating to the Estimates cycle in recent years.  In 2006, it instituted a new autumn pre-budget outlook.  Since 2007, the Estimates of expenditure have been determined and presented alongside the annual tax decisions on budget day.  This unified approach to the budget has facilitated the Government in making all of the necessary budget decisions in a coherent and integrated manner.  Naturally, the established budgetary framework has also had to be adapted and applied in a flexible manner in the past two to three years as the Government has been obliged to move swiftly to deal with emerging economic and budgetary issues.</P>
        <P>It is no secret that like all other member states, Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary timetable will have to be reviewed to take account of recent agreements among all EU leaders in respect of the new European semester that will come into effect in 2011.  Under this new arrangement, and having regard to the overall macroeconomic view set out early in the year by the EU Commission, all <Col N="307"/>Governments will be required to publish a stability programme update by the end of April, well in advance of the subsequent budget.  Each member state&rsquo;s draft proposals for the following year&rsquo;s budget will then be considered and the views of the Commission and the EU Council will be made known.  The implications of this arrangement for existing Irish budgetary processes will have to be considered carefully.  As a general principle, however, the Government is in favour of a restructured approach to budget formation that will allow greater space for the informed views of the Oireachtas and of our EU colleagues to be taken into account.</P>
        <P>The performance dimension is critical to delivering improvements to public service delivery and efficiency.  This is an area in respect of which good progress has been made in recent years.  Annual output statements were introduced in 2007.  These provide an opportunity for the relevant D&aacute;il select committees to scrutinise the voted expenditure allocations for each Department and to query the public service outputs and outcomes to be delivered with public moneys.  In its 2008 review of the Irish public service, the OECD was complimentary with regard to output statements.  At the same time, it spelled out some ways in which this performance aspect of budgeting could be improved and integrated more fully into the resource allocation process.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>On the subject of the role of Oireachtas committees in scrutinising the economy and efficiency of individual spending programmes, this again is an area where the Government has been at pains to make all relevant information available to the Oireachtas.  As part of the enhanced value for money framework announced over recent years, expenditure in each area of Government is subject to periodic value for money and policy reviews.  These detailed expenditure appraisals are conducted by the relevant Department with input from the Department of Finance, and when completed they are laid before the relevant select committee of the Oireachtas for scrutiny.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>On the question of an independent fiscal advisory council separate from Government mechanisms, the first point to make is that there is no shortage of commentary, independent or otherwise, on the budgetary and economic plans and projections put forward by the Government at budget time each year.  This commentary has arisen in recent years but what is important is that the Government has acted at all times on the best informed budgetary forecasting advice on the basis of the latest possible information available at any one point in time.</P>
        <P>That having been said, it is the practice in several countries for the policy-making institutions of the state to have access to separate, independent mechanisms for providing economic analysis and advice, to complement the official mechanisms within the Government.  The Government is now considering a wide range of structural reforms in the context of preparing our four year plan and budget 2011 and we will be taking full account of international best practice in this area.  It is with pleasure that I commend the Government&rsquo;s counter-motion to the House in light of the changes we have introduced in recent years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and I thank the Minister of State for sharing his time.  The motion we have heard this evening from the Labour Party covers an extremely broad range of areas.  The Labour Party motion proposes a wide variety of measures, including in regard to matters of Cabinet confidentiality, the Freedom of Information Act, whistleblowers&rsquo; legislation, spending limits for elections, contributions to political parties, registration of lobbyists, D&aacute;il reform, the establishment of an independent fiscal advisory council, bringing forward the Estimates cycle, publication of the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice in specified circumstances, increased powers for Oireachtas committees and amendments to the Ministers and Secretaries Acts and the Public Service Management Act.</P><Col N="308"/>
        <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, has already told the House, the Government has already been and continues to be active in progressing these areas, many of which are already outlined in the renewed programme for Government.  The motion calls for the restoration of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 to its original form and scope and the extension of its remit to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other public bodies.</P>
        <P>From my perspective as an elected representative, I believe that freedom of information legislation has been an important development in our modern democratic system and has helped to improve the engagement between the citizen and the Administration.  The Government does not support the Labour Party motion&rsquo;s proposal to overturn key provisions in the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003.  These provisions were introduced to ensure the appropriate balance between facilitating public access to information and the proper functioning of government.</P>
        <P>As Deputies are aware, the Department of Finance keeps the number of bodies covered by the Act under regular review.  There are over 500 bodies at the current time.  I understand that a number of bodies have been identified as possibly being suitable for freedom of information coverage and the Department of Finance is currently examining how the Act might apply to these bodies.  In particular, it should be noted that the renewed programme for Government states the Freedom of Information Acts will be expanded to include certain administrative matters in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The Departments of Finance and Justice and Law Reform are currently examining the various issues and challenges relating to the extension of the Act to specific administrative functions within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The group will identify administrative functions for freedom of information coverage, together with recommendations and an implementation plan for approval by the Ministers for Justice and Law Reform and Finance.</P>
        <P>The motion also calls for the introduction of a programme of reform that would include spending limits for local and presidential elections and a reduction in the ceilings for European and general elections.  The Electoral Act 1997, as amended, provides for spending limits at general, European and presidential elections.  The following expenditure limits applied to candidates at the most recent relevant elections: &euro;230,000 for the European Parliament in 2009; in the 2007 D&aacute;il election &euro;45,200 for a five-seat constituency, &euro;37,650 for a four-seat constituency and &euro;30,150 for a three-seat constituency; and &euro;1.3 million for the presidential election in 2004.  In the current economic climate, there will be no difficulty keeping under those figures and I would not object if they were reduced.</P>
        <P>I understand legislation providing for spending limits at local elections was put in place in 2009 by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  These limits range from &euro;7,500 to &euro;15,000, depending on the population within a local electoral area and the specific type of election.  As Deputies know, these limits applied for the first time at the local elections held in that year.  The Government is also currently giving consideration to approaches to effect changes to provide for further controls on political donations and political funding.</P>
        <P>Turning to lobbying, it is right that the regulation of lobbyists, including the introduction of a register, is being considered by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who will bring proposals to Government.  That needs to be done.</P>
        <P>As regards D&aacute;il reform, I understand that proposals were brought before the relevant forum, namely, the sub-committee of the D&aacute;il Committee on Procedure and Privileges specifically concerned with D&aacute;il reform.  The proposals included many useful ideas such as increased sitting <Col N="309"/>days, consolidating the amount of time that the Taoiseach and Opposition leaders would spend in the House, starting the D&aacute;il earlier each day and dealing with the current position about promised legislation only once a week.  I welcome these proposals and believe that they would enable the D&aacute;il to be more reactive to issues which become newsworthy on any given day.  These proposals are in addition to the opportunity that Leaders&rsquo; Questions in particular affords Opposition leaders in the House.</P>
        <P>As somebody who spent five years in the Seanad, I fully concur with the view that it is important that whether one is in Government, the backbenches or an Independent Deputy, there are issues of the day which affect one&rsquo;s local constituency.  It is important that Deputies of all parties should have an opportunity to raise relevant issues on a particular day.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, for sharing his time.</P>
        <P>The motion we have heard from the Labour Party covers an extremely broad range of areas including D&aacute;il reform, freedom of information, whistleblowers&rsquo; information and contributions to political parties.  The Government has already been and continues to be active in progressing these areas, many of which are outlined in the renewed programme for Government.  The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, has comprehensively addressed all of these issues in his statement.  I wish to address a number of these issues now.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State outlined in his statement, as part of a commitment in the renewed programme for Government, the provisions of the code of conduct for civil servants in regard to the acceptance of outside appointments or consultancy engagement following resignation or retirement will be extended to all public servants in designated posts.  This is a welcome development.  It will ensure that public servants cannot accept an offer of appointment from an outside employer where it is deemed to create a conflict of interest or accept an engagement in a particular consultancy project, where the nature and terms of such appointment or engagement could lead to a conflict of interest, without first obtaining approval from the Outside Appointments Board.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party motion as proposed by Deputy Howlin also makes reference to the issue of the roles and responsibilities of Ministers and Secretaries General.  It states the responsibilities of Secretaries General be strengthened by assigning to them authority and accountability for ensuring that the Department and its officers perform their functions in a non-political and impartial manner, in accordance with law, the highest ethical standards of conduct and integrity and any prescribed code of conduct.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister of State that it is critical that we maintain an appropriate balance between the two in respect of policy and administration.  The issue has been addressed in the Public Service Management Act, which formed a key element of the drive under the strategic management initiative to improve performance and accountability.</P>
        <P>As we all know, the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes was established by the Government to examine critically and assess all areas of Government expenditure.  It was chaired by economist Colm McCarthy and became more commonly known as an bord snip nua.  Its report was published by the Government in July 2009 and proposed a reduction of 17,300 in numbers and specific savings measures of &euro;5.3 billion.</P>
        <P>It is a thorough and detailed examination of all departmental spending, examining in particular what is intended to be achieved by each spending programme, whether it has been achieved and whether the level of spending is justified in current resource-limited conditions. <Col N="310"/> As we all know, on the basis of its analysis, an bord snip nua presented some difficult policy options.  These are the choices that we as a people, and not just as public representatives and Government, will have to face up to in order to get this nation back on track, create jobs, meet public needs and promote fairness, which we have proved we can do as a society over the past 20 years.</P>
        <P>The Government has moved to implement many of the measures recommended in that report and continues to consult its proposals, especially when considering structural reforms within the public administration system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A progressive reform of the cycle of Estimates has also been effected by the Government in recent years.  The publication, in 2006, of a new autumn pre-budget outlook document enables the provision of a full range of information on the public finances in advance of budget decisions.  Since 2007, the Estimates of expenditure have been determined and presented alongside the annual tax decisions on budget day.  This unified budget approach has facilitated the Government in making all of the necessary budget decisions in a coherent and integrated manner.</P>
        <P>The rapidly emerging and evolving economic and budgetary issues have necessitated altering and adapting the established budgetary framework over the past two to three years.  In common with all other member states, Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary timetable will have to be reviewed to take account of recent agreements among all EU leaders on the new European semester that will come into effect in 2011.  All Governments are required, under this new arrangement, to publish a stability programme update by end-April.  This update must reflect the overall macro-economic view set out early in the year by the EU Commission and be released well in advance of the subsequent budget.  All member state&rsquo;s draft proposals for the following year&rsquo;s budget will be considered and the views of the Commission and the EU Council will be advanced.  It is true, as the Minister stated, that the details of this arrangement will have to be considered carefully, but as a general principle we are in favour of a restructured approach to budget formation that allows greater space for the informed views of the Oireachtas and of our EU colleagues to be taken into account.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Government&rsquo;s amendment and its recommendations.</P>

	<P>Ten minutes each.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Labour Party motion before the House tonight.  No doubt there is a good and decent set of proposals contained in the motion but if we are to change politics in Ireland, this must go much further.</P>
        <P>Since I entered Parliament in 2002 there have been few changes in the way it works, in the way Deputies work, in the committee system and in the workings of Irish politics.  As we approach difficult economic times where there will be cutbacks across every sector of politics, the public sector and every Department, politicians must lead by example.  If we are to do that, there must be major changes within the political system.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has come up with a strong and radical set of proposals in its New Politics document which was launched more than a year ago.  At the time, that document proposing the abolition <Col N="311"/>of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and a reduction of 20 TDs in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann caused much debate up and down the country.  As a party, we share many of the views and aims mentioned in tonight&rsquo;s motion.</P>
        <P>What has happened in recent years is much to blame for current economic circumstances.  In this Parliament no one could be held to account.  Deputy Stanton will outline in his contribution proposals for D&aacute;il reform, but I want to talk about the quangos and semi-State bodies where people got away with blue murder in recent years because there was no accountability and no one was brought in here to be questioned in the committee system.  Had there been accountability in the political system over the past 15 years we would not face the economic circumstances we now face.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il policies caused the so-called golden circle of builders and bankers.  The citizen, the main person who should have been looked after in this Parliament, was left to one side and the so-called golden circle of builders, bankers and developers were all looked after.  That amounts to complete political failure and it lies at the heart of our economic collapse.  It lies at the heart of government also because the Government was responsible for what happened.</P>
        <P>Under the Fine Gael proposal, the New Politics document, we can reverse that culture.  We must restore trust to the people.  We must bring the citizen, communities and interested bodies into our political heart and into the political system and make them feel that this Parliament belongs to them as much as it belongs to the politicians who are elected to the House.  We must make them feel that their input is appreciated.  We must ensure that the citizen&rsquo;s voice is heard.  The citizen&rsquo;s voice is something that has been lost within this Parliament.  We want to tackle the weaknesses in the political system and create a credible parliament.  Compared to the way other parliaments operate their political systems, the Irish Parliament is way down the Richter scale.</P>
        <P>We must make Governments accountable.  They want to pass the buck and make it somebody else&rsquo;s responsibility.  There are numerous examples of that.  When one sees Ministers setting up quangos to take on responsibility there is no accountability for the bodies set up.  That has happened wholesale within this Parliament.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will give two examples, the Freedom of Information Acts and the whistleblowers&rsquo; legislation.  The Minister outlined it, and it is in the programme for Government, and Deputy Scanlon spoke about it.  In 1997, Fine Gael introduced the first Freedom of Information Bill.  It was strong, and it was there for the citizen to find out information about decision-making and what was happening within Government, different Departments, semi-State bodies or whatever.  The Government, in 2003, came back and took the Freedom of Information Act that we had enacted in 1997 a step backwards by placing restrictions on the citizen being able to find out information.  It was a bad step to take.</P>
        <P>The other area is whistleblowers&rsquo; legislation.  The Fine Gael Party and the general public believe that if there was strong legislation put in place to protect persons within the workplace we would not be in the circumstances we are in today.  People would have felt that they would be protected if they wanted to highlight issues within the banking system and within Departments, especially within the area of banking.  We must have strong robust legislation to protect the worker to give him or her the opportunity to come forward and highlight issues relevant to the D&aacute;il and the Parliament, and to feel protected in doing so.</P>
        <P>Many issues are raised with regard to wrongdoing in Departments.  Employees who come forward to highlight issues do not feel protected.  This has to change and a Fine Gael-led Government will make this a priority and will introduce a Bill to address the issue.</P><Col N="312"/>
        <P>If people do not have an opportunity to highlight issues, they do not feel the Parliament is relevant and, as it stands today, this Parliament is not relevant.  We need cost savings in the Parliament and to create a lean and more fit-for-purpose type of Parliament.  This is lacking, which is highlighted to me by members of the public who state the Parliament we have does not work and needs to be more efficient and relevant.  It is not enough to pay lip-service to what Members have stated this evening.  I have no doubt that most Members want to see the Chamber and the Oireachtas being more efficient; we have to grasp the issue and take action.  There is no use talking about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  It is good that we are speaking about how we do business as we do not do so half often enough.  I wish to draw attention to something the Minister of State said.  He probably received a script, which is typical for Ministers and Ministers of State, and he probably read it for the first time when he spoke here.  He stated, &ldquo;As regards D&aacute;il reform, proposals agreed by the Government last year were brought before the relevant forum of the D&aacute;il Committee on Procedure and Privileges, namely, the Sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform&rdquo;.  I am a member of that sub-committee but it did not happen.  The Minister of State should check his facts before he comes here and reads them out.  The Minister of State also stated, &ldquo;Consensus has not so far proved possible on the Government&rsquo;s proposals&rdquo;.  If we could discuss them it would be useful.  However we have not seen them.  We have not had a meeting since last April while the sub-committee has met once this year.</P>
        <P>If the Government is serious about D&aacute;il reform, the Minister of State should not come to the House this evening and imply, by stating that consensus has not so far proved possible on the Government&rsquo;s proposals, that the Opposition did not agree.  This is disingenuous.  The Minister of State should do his homework before he comes to the House and makes such a statement.  We have been trying very hard to get the Government engaged on D&aacute;il reform.  Time and again, I have tried to engage the Taoiseach in the House.  He states it is a matter for the Chief Whip and the sub-committee.  The sub-committee will not meet.  What can we do?  How can we have a debate and discussion on D&aacute;il reform when the Government will not engage and does not seem a bit interested in it?</P>
        <P>Deputy Kehoe rightly maintained that the economic mess we are in at present could in some way be attributed to the fact that this House does not work as it should.  The Executive completely controls what goes on here.  I draw the attention of the House to the fact that in the UK and Ireland alone, the Government determines the plenary agenda almost completely.  In other European countries, such as the Netherlands and Italy, the Chamber decides the agenda.  In Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Sweden, the Speaker or President &mdash; depending on the office title &mdash;  is very much engaged in the agenda of Parliament.  However, we cannot discuss these matters in the House because the Government will not engage.</P>
        <P>The legislative process in other countries is done in a completely different way.  Here, this Chamber is a rubber stamp for the Government.  Legislation is brought here more or less as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  In other countries, the heads of a Bill are brought before the Parliament and the ideas are discussed before it goes back to the Department and the Government for the final document to be produced.  This does not happen here.  More and more, we see amendments coming forward at the last minute on Report Stage and the guillotine being used excessively with no debate.  This is dangerous and wrong.</P><Col N="313"/>
        <P>In a few minutes we will have the Adjournment debate; a major set piece where Deputies come in and read scripts.  A Minister or Minister of State, very often not involved in the relevant Department, will take out of his or her pocket a prepared script that anticipates what the Opposition Member or Government backbencher will have stated and reads it for the first time.  This is called a debate.  Who are we codding?  Recently, I watched a similar procedure in the UK Parliament.  There, the Minister invited questions from the Member of the Opposition.  In this Parliament during such a debate we are not allowed to ask questions.  We tried to change this.  Fine Gael proposed four or five very small technical amendments to procedure that would have made a big difference but the Government would not engage.  The Government will not discuss or make any change even though on his first day in office the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, spoke about reform.  However, he will not do so, indeed he has been an obstacle to reform of any type.</P>
        <P>Last week, we were criticised in the media for script reading.  This is what the Chamber has been reduced to.  Instead of being a battleground of ideas, we script read at each other.  This is not good enough.  There is no debate or interaction.  We have not seen the Government&rsquo;s D&aacute;il reform package but I would like to see it.  I am a member of the sub-committee and I ask the Minister of State to show it to me.  I have been asking for it for the past two years.</P>
        <P>People are frustrated.  Members try to raise issues using parliamentary procedure such as Standing Order 32.  It is a joke but it is the only way people can mention in the Parliament serious issues of concern that need to be addressed there and then.  In other European Parliaments, one can stand up in the morning and raise an issue and the Minister does not feel attacked.  Very often, the Minister will thank the Member for raising the issue and for bringing it to his or her attention, state he or she was not aware of it and that he or she will communicate with  the Member later in the day.  Here, a Minister looks on it as a personal attack if one tries to ask a question.  This needs to change.  It is not good enough for a Minister or a Minister of State to come in here and read out drivel which he or she has probably never read before.  It is wrong in fact and in spirit.  People are very frustrated.</P>
        <P>Quangos have been mentioned.  Every time the Government wants to hide behind something it sets up a new quango.  Recently, I tried to find out about the closure of the courthouse in Cobh.  A diktat came from on high.  I was told the Minister is no longer responsible and that responsibility now lies with the Courts Service.  I asked the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights to write to the Courts Service to find out why the courthouse was shut because the people want to know.  I am still waiting for a response.  People were not consulted, they were not told or asked.  It does not matter how inconvenienced they were, the Minister hides behind the quango.  Other quangos include the National Roads Authority and the HSE, which is the biggest of them all.  What are we doing here?  One cannot get answers to anything.  All these bodies spend public money.  We are sent here to somehow make them accountable for the people but we cannot do so.</P>
        <P>This Parliament is totally controlled by the Executive.  This is wrong and dangerous and needs to change.  The Executive controls the plenary agenda, decides legislation, decides what is debated, how it is debated, when it is debated and, very often who debates it and for how long.  People are frustrated and, as Deputy Kehoe stated, this House is seen as almost irrelevant at this stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We had the cosy consensus of social partnership where people went into a room and, behind closed doors, decided what should be done.  This is Parliament, where we debate in public so that people can see what we say.  Why is it that the Sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform, when it meets once a year, meets in private?  It should meet in public.</P><Col N="314"/>
        <P>We are still waiting for proposals on an electoral commission which we are told might bring some of these things forward.  I would like to see major changes in how the House operates but I know this will not happen so I brought forward five minor changes.  Let us have supplementary questions on Adjournment debates.  Let us get rid of Standing Order 32 and allow Deputies to ask questions for 30 seconds.  Taoiseach&rsquo;s Question Time is the most boring time in the House.  Very often, something that happened six months ago is discussed.  It is a waste of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s time and our time.  The Government will not engage with us.  I ask the Minister of State to engage with the House on this matter.</P>

	<P>The announcement of the labour activation fund was accompanied by great fanfare when it was announced by the Minister last March.  At that time we were told it would go a long way towards redressing our grave concerns about the number of people unemployed and in particular, the number of young people who have been forced to join the live register.  It was envisaged that this fund would provide myriad schemes to enable young people and others to avail of opportunities for reskilling and upskilling.  Unemployment is currently at record levels with more than 450,000 people on the live register, most of whom are young people.  The most recent live register figures issued show there has been a slight decline in the number of people signing on.  However, we all know through interaction with friends, family and neighbours and in our constituencies, that young people graduating from school and university are opting to leave the country in search of better opportunities overseas.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the State needs to take action and this fund was to provide some hope and some significant investment in people who have been unfortunate to find themselves out of work so they will be better placed to gain employment in the future.  In response to my recent parliamentary question the Minister confirmed that &euro;32 million has been allocated to the labour market activation fund but to date, only &euro;8.4 million has been drawn down.  Considering the urgent need to re-educate people and to retrain and upskill people for economic activities in other sectors which have prospects for the future, this is very disappointing.</P>
        <P>In my first parliamentary question to the Minister a number of weeks ago he was unable to give me any figures regarding the number of people who have benefited from the scheme but, miraculously, I have received a reply as a result of tabling this Adjournment matter.  However, it is still extremely unclear and I hope the Minister in his response will be able to shed some light on the numbers of people whom it is envisaged will benefit from this scheme, how many have benefited to date and how many have benefited from further education placements and reskilling and retraining.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding the labour market activation fund.</P><Col N="315"/>
        <P>As part of budget 2010, the Government announced the creation of a &euro;20 million labour market activation fund, intended to deliver 3,500 places on training and education programmes for the unemployed.  Its objective is to stimulate innovation in the provision of training and activation measures for jobseekers seeking to upskill and get back into work.  The fund is being targeted to specific priority groups among the unemployed &mdash; the low skilled, and those formerly employed in declining sectors &mdash; construction, retail and manufacturing sectors &mdash; with particular emphasis on the under-35s and the long-term unemployed.</P>
        <P>In order to leverage to maximum effect the potential of the market for efficient and value-for-money delivery of full-time or part-time education and training provision for the unemployed, an open tender competition was launched in March 2010.  Some 370 tenders were received from public, private, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations, demonstrating a level of response and quality of proposals that exceeded the most optimistic expectations.  Offers of funding were initially made to 26 organisations.  On 5 August, an additional allocation of &euro;12 million was made available by the Department of Education and Skills, enabling funding to be offered to 33 additional projects.  This brought total funding to &euro;32 million for 59 projects proposing to provide up to 12,000 education and training places for the unemployed.</P>
        <P>The initial phase of the labour market activation fund comprised 26 projects aiming to provide more than 6,500 education and training places in all geographical regions.  The successful tenderers for this project were spread among 13 public bodies, eight private training and education providers, and five not-for-profit organisations.  Places offered to unemployed people included courses that range from higher education programmes to upskilling courses with accreditation up to level eight available to participants.  In the main, these projects are meeting their interim targets.  As of mid-October, some 3,441 or 52% of phase one places were already filled, with further courses coming on stream between November 2010 and January 2011.  On the basis of current information, it appears that the targets for places to be provided as set out in tenders by projects can largely be met.  A total of 33 projects aiming to provide some 5,400 places in all geographic regions benefited from the second tranche of funding allocated in August.  Many projects are still in the process of recruiting participants and success in attaining the numbers of participants will be reviewed when progress reports are received as required by the contracts.  Projects will be contractually obliged to provide detailed progress reports by December 2010 at the latest on actual activity levels.</P>
        <P>The level of uptake by participants in projects to date is very encouraging and indicates the strong labour market relevance of the successful projects.  Feedback from participants has been very positive, indicating strong support for the innovative and employment-oriented range of education and training measures, which are being provided through the fund.</P>
        <P>The Department has embarked on a comprehensive monitoring and financial control exercise, including visits to the locations of education and training programmes throughout the country, to ensure that programmes are being delivered as contracted for; that required documentary evidence is being maintained of programme activity, including details of course participation, logs of course activities, and records of inputs-time by project personnel; that appropriate accounts of all receipts and expenditure are being kept on site, and can be produced on demand; that projects show evidence of adhering to the quality assurance standards set down by the accrediting authorities; and that participants will be consulted directly concerning various aspects of the programmes to ensure that all project stakeholders are heard.</P>
        <P>As of end-October 2010, &euro;8.4 million had been paid to projects.  It is anticipated that by year&rsquo;s end some &euro;18 million will have been drawn from the fund.  The balance of &euro;14 million <Col N="316"/>represents the liability to projects for payments that fall due during 2011, subject to them meeting the delivery terms of the contract.</P>
        <P>The budget 2010 announcement of a fund of &euro;20 million envisaged provision of 3,500 training and education places for the unemployed.  This implied a forecast participant unit cost of &euro;5,700.  This target placement rate was achieved in October 2010, and the average participant unit cost for the first 26 programmes is now expected to be &euro;2,900.  The Department will carry out analysis of actual programme costs when final data are to hand, to include cost comparisons with mainstream provision.  The objective will be to provide a value-for-money assessment of this funding model and its potential for delivering effective and efficient programmes for the unemployed into the future.</P>
        <P>The Government remains intent on meeting the ongoing challenges in the labour market.  In addition to specific labour market activation measures, this Government&rsquo;s continuing focus will also be on supporting and promoting enterprise development to create new jobs at national and county level.  Continuing to support employment creation will be the key determinant in addressing our current unemployment problem.  In the interim, we will continue to provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities to those who find themselves out of employment so that they will be able to avail of future employment opportunities.  I thank the Deputy once again for raising this matter and I hope the reply has increased her level of information.</P>

      <sTitle>Report on Magdalene Laundries</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the recommendations of the Irish Human Rights Commission that the Government initiate a statutory inquiry into the human rights violations arising from the treatment of women and young girls in the Magdalene laundries.  I welcome the fact the Attorney General will now examine the IHRC report in consultation with the relevant Departments.  The IHRC concluded that for these women and girls who entered the laundries following a court process there was a clear State involvement in their entry despite the statements to the contrary by various Ministers.  In light of the report I believe the survivors of Magdalene laundries should receive an apology from the State and a distinct redress scheme for survivors of the laundries should be established.  The survivors of the Bethany Home should be treated in the same way.  I believe it was a major error to exclude the Magdalene laundries from the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 and the subsequent redress scheme.</P>
        <P>There are no records available of any women or young girls who were referred to laundries by State agencies, or the children born to them.  Neither is there any clear information on whether or how girls or women left the laundries, or if they had a choice in doing so.  All of this information should be made available.  To this end, I ask CORI and the four religious congregations that operated the laundries to agree to meet Justice for Magdalenes to deal with the issues of records, compensation and other related matters.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to Dr. James Smith of Boston College and the Justice for Magdalenes group, with whom I first came into contact in August 2009, for their relentless efforts in seeking justice for survivors of Magdalene laundries.  Dr. Smith is in the Visitors Gallery tonight with Dr. Katherine O&rsquo;Donnell.  They and their group have met with many obstacles at State and church levels along their journey but today is a very significant day for them in their campaign and it will give them great strength to see this campaign through until restorative justice is achieved in the case of the Magdalene survivors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my privilege and that of Deputies Tom Kitt and Kathleen Lynch to work on an <i>ad hoc</i> committee in the Houses in trying to assist the Justice for Magdalenes group.  Like Deputy Kitt, I want to welcome Dr. James Smith and his colleague, Dr. Katherine O&rsquo;Donnell.  I commend them on the fantastic work they have done to date against great obstacles.</P>
        <P>Deputy Tom Kitt referred to the recommendations of the Irish Human Rights Commission report, the launch of which we had the privilege of attending today.  Redress is one matter but a State apology is a very simple issue.  Women have been referred to these laundries going back to the foundation of the State and right up to 1996.  One might excuse the dark ages of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s but 1996 is just 14 years ago and these laundries were still in operation.  We need a State apology.  We need to say the simple word &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; to these women.  Many of them are very old, and nearing death in some cases.  If they heard a State apology simply saying the State was sorry for incarcerating them, many of these women would die happy.</P>
        <P>It is not too much to ask the State to say &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; for referring to these women as penitents and as sinners.  Ordinary human beings like the rest of us had the stigma that they were sinners or penitents attached to them.  It is not too much to ask that their birth names would be recorded.  Many of them were given religious names when they went into these institutions, their children were taken away from them for adoption and their birth records have not been handed over to their siblings or their children.  I see no reason we cannot, as an institution of the State, say &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; for not doing that.</P>
        <P>I believe the State owes an apology to these women for refusing them their freedom, for not protecting their constitutional rights and for not giving them a proper education.  The State has to be culpable for referring these ladies to laundries directly from our courts.  When one considers how particular we are today about rules and regulations in working institutions, these ladies had no working wage, no maximum hours of work and no holiday time, and there were no inspections, regulations or safe working conditions in any of these institutions.  That was the responsibility of the State.</P>
        <P>The State should immediately say &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; to these ladies.  It should remove the words &ldquo;penitent&rdquo; and &ldquo;sinner&rdquo; from burial stones.  We should have the common decency to erect memorial stones throughout the country at the location of these institutions.  We should have the responsibility of examining the legislation with regard to why there was no record showing these ladies were cremated and buried in a mass grave at High Park in Drumcondra.  We feel very strongly on this issue.  I urge the Government to establish the redress scheme and make the apology.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>If I were voiceless, I could ask for no better champion than Dr. James Smith, who is in the Visitors Gallery tonight.  None of the three Deputies involved is saying this just because he is present, and we have said it in private to those who would listen.  He is a man who took on a story that has shamed us as a nation.  If anything cries to the heaven for revenge and to be put right, this story does so.  Yet, these people do not ask for revenge, nor does he.  They simply ask that the terrible wrong done to them be recognised and that the State stand up and say &ldquo;We were wrong and we are sorry for what you have suffered&rdquo;.  I do not make the distinction between those who were put in as a direct responsibility of the State and those who were put in by society in all its forms, whether it was the busybody on the street, the social worker, the local priest or otherwise.</P>
        <P>Over the weekend, I heard a news story about a kidnapped woman whose husband worked for a major financial institution.  It must be the most awful thing to happen.  All of the agencies <Col N="318"/>of the State rose up to find that woman and to bring her safely back to her family.  All I could think of was why the agencies of the State which were charged with the responsibility in regard to these women did not go into these institutions and ask &ldquo;Are you here of your own free will?  How long are you supposed to be here for?  Would you like to leave?&rdquo;  None of us did that.  Even for those who were put in by their families or by society, when they managed to escape &mdash; and it was &ldquo;escape&rdquo; &mdash; they were captured by the police and returned.</P>
<?oasys _cl14- ?>
        <P>Those were awful times, although not that long ago.  The State is as culpable as the institutions in which these women were held because the State allowed this to continue.  We are not seeking revenge, nor are these women or their children.  What they are seeking is a recognition of who they were and what their lives were.  They do not have that because there is a blanket refusal to release records, which needs to happen.</P>
        <P>I know that within these institutions there were many fine people.  This cannot go on another generation; it must be dealt with.  As long as it is not dealt with, it will continue.  We may not be here but someone else will be.  I ask the Minister of State to go back to Cabinet and tell those who sit around that table that this can go on no longer.  We have dealt with one awful period of our history and this is another part of our history that we need to address.  We can either dealt with it now or in the future but, one way or the other, we will have to deal with it.  On behalf of the State, I ask the Minister of State to stand up and say: &ldquo;We are sorry, it should not have happened and we should not have allowed it to continue&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Michael Kennedy, Tom Kitt and Kathleen Lynch for raising this issue.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who I am sure will take careful note of the forceful views that have been expressed on all sides of the House.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P Just="Left">I have great sympathy for those who ended up in Magdalene laundries.  We are dealing with a very sad and shameful chapter in our social history.  The laundries existed in an era when Irish society could be harsh and hostile to the less fortunate and those who did not comply with what was perceived as respectable.  Life in an institution can be a poor substitute for the emotional and other support normally found in a family setting.  Officials of the Department of Justice and Law Reform have met individuals who were in such institutions as well as representative groups such as Justice for Magdalenes.  There is no question about their integrity or commitment.  Any records available to the Department have been shared with the groups concerned and officials will continue to provide all assistance possible to the individuals and interest groups seeking available records.  That was made abundantly clear in the meeting with Justice for Magdalenes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Turning now to the specific issue at hand, section 9 of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000 provides a statutory mechanism whereby the Human Rights Commission may conduct an inquiry into any relevant matter.  I understand that in June 2010 Justice for Magdalenes formally requested the commission to carry out such an inquiry into the treatment of women and girls who resided in Magdalene laundries.  The commission has today published its assessment of that request and has decided that it will not carry out the requested inquiry.  That is a decision for the commission and I do not propose to make any comment on that aspect of the assessment report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report is an assessment of the human rights issues arising in regard to the Magdalene laundries.  It touches on areas that fall within the remit of a number of Departments, including the Departments of Justice and Law Reform, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Health and Children, Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Education and Skills and Health and Children.  To the best of my knowledge, the Human Rights Commission did not seek information or observations from these Departments on the issues that were being assessed.  Simi<Col N="319"/>larly there is no indication that information or observations were sought from the religious congregations and other groups which ran the Magdalene laundries and mother and baby homes and the reputations of which are at issue.</P>
        <P>The report includes 12 conclusions, many of which are not definitive and use language such as &ldquo;questions arise&rdquo; or &ldquo;may have breached its obligations&rdquo;.  Nevertheless, it is surprising that a body such as the Human Rights Commission apparently did not think it appropriate to provide an opportunity for other perspectives to be taken into account before it published its conclusions on the issues.  Such consultation would have allowed the commission to provide a much more comprehensive overview and could have informed its conclusions.</P>
        <P>In this context, it must be pointed out that the Human Rights Commission did not make a definite finding that there were human rights violations.  The report discusses allegations and the possibility that there were human rights violations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s script was obviously written by officials in the Department of Justice and Law Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>In this House, we have to respect the rights of those who have suffered abuse but there also has to be some regard to the constitutional rights of those accused of wrongdoing.  The Human Rights Commission has decided that it should not carry out a statutory inquiry but has recommended that a statutory mechanism be established to investigate the matters advanced by Justice for Magdalenes and in appropriate cases to grant redress where warranted.  It advises that such a mechanism should first examine the State&rsquo;s involvement in and responsibility for those entering laundries, their conditions, their departure and end of life issues.  In the event of State involvement or responsibility being established a larger review should be conducted and redress should be considered.</P>
        <P>The details of the report will be considered by the relevant Departments and the Office of the Attorney General.  I fully appreciate the wish of Deputies in this House to raise the report.  However, it was only published this morning and it behoves all of us to give careful and detailed consideration to what it says before giving a detailed response.  For clarity it may be helpful to touch on some of the issues that will have to be considered.  Besides the provision in the Human Rights Commission Act 2000 for a statutory inquiry, the other statutory mechanism for inquiries include the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2004 and the Commission of Investigation Act 2004.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At first reading the subject matter of an inquiry as proposed by the Human Rights Commission seems to encompass both Magdalene laundries and mother and baby homes.  No time limit is set.  We are dealing with what happened to a large number of people over an extended period of time starting in the 1920s, although the exact figure is unclear.  These were privately run institutions and, as the Human Rights Commission concludes, the available public records are poor and incomplete.  The challenges facing any statutory inquiry, whether a tribunal of inquiry or a commission of investigation, should therefore not be underestimated.</P>
        <P>We are all familiar with the excellent work done by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  That was an inquiry primarily into industrial schools which were provided for by statute and funded by the Exchequer.  The inquiry alone cost over &euro;120 million and if the cost of redress is included the total cost amounted to &euro;1.36 billion.  In the current economic climate, the Government will have to take into account the practical difficulties, including the level and degree of practical co-operation that would be given by interested parties, that any potential inquiry might face, as well as resource implications.  We must learn from the lessons of other investigations, and not least be mindful of the age profile of the group we are all concerned to assist in the best way possible.</P><Col N="320"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P Just="Left">I will also clarify the extent of the criminal justice system involvement in Magdalene laundries, which was frequently aimed at not giving such women a criminal record.  Under the Probation of Offenders Act 1907, where a court of summary jurisdiction thinks a criminal charge is proved against the accused the court may, without recording a conviction, discharge the person conditionally on his or her entering into recognisance to be of good behaviour and to appear for conviction and sentence at any time during such period not exceeding three years as may be specified in the order; or where a person has been convicted on indictment, a court may release the offender on probation conditionally on his or her entering into recognisance to be of good behaviour and to appear for sentence at any time during such period not exceeding three years as may be specified in the order.  Courts did impose conditions in some probation orders that the accused female should reside in the Henrietta Street home or a Magdalene laundry for a specified period.  This mechanism was used both for relatively minor cases tried in the District Court as well as in serious cases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to note that the courts did not have any power under the Probation of Offenders Act to order a female to be detained in a home or laundry as an alternative to prison.  The person was not detained in custody but if the convicted female did not abide by any of the conditions of the probation order, including residing in the home, the recognisance could be forfeit and she was liable to be brought before the court again for sentencing.  Probation orders are of a specific and limited duration of no more than three years and are of no effect once they expire.  There are no central records that would show the number of probation orders requiring a female to reside in particular homes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A preliminary examination of the records of the High Court sitting as the Central Criminal Court in the period from 1945 to 1950 indicate that a number of women charged with murder pleaded guilty to manslaughter or concealment of birth.  The sentence they received was either imprisonment suspended on condition that the convicted person enter into a recognisance, be bound to the peace and enter an institution, most commonly but not always a Magdalene laundry, for a specific period; or enter into a recognisance, be bound to the peace and enter an institution for a specific period with the possibility that she might be called to have a sentence imposed within that specified period.</P>
      
        <P>One year&rsquo;s residence in an institution was the most common period imposed.  In only one case, in which a five-year period was imposed, did it exceed two years.  The accused had legal representation in all of the cases.  In one or two cases, a named probation officer was designated to escort the convicted person to the institution.  The numbers involved seemed to have been one or two a year.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The courts have the power to remand a person charged with criminal offences in custody pending trial and sentencing.  In these cases, the periods of remand were normally quite short and would rarely exceed seven days.  The Department of Justice and Law Reform is responsible for providing places for people remanded in custody.  In October 1960, the then Minister for Justice approved two institutions in Dublin &mdash; St. Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s Asylum in Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street and Our Lady&rsquo;s Home in Henrietta Street &mdash; for use as a remand institution for females between the ages of 16 and 21, pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act 1960.  Arrangements were made to ensure those remanded had the same rights and privileges provided for remand prisoners in the 1947 Prison Rules Part III, and would be visited from time to time by a probation officer and the superintendent of prisons.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All the evidence available suggests that the number of women who entered Magdalene  laundries through the criminal justice system was small.  It is worth noting that no complaints have been received from any of these women.  I have listened on behalf of the Minister to the <Col N="321"/>strongly held views that have been expressed by each of the three Deputies.  I am sure their views represent the feelings of most Members of the House and most people outside it.  As I said, the Government will consider carefully the points made by the Human Rights Commission in today&rsquo;s report.</P>

      <sTitle>State Procurement Contracts</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The issue I am raising is different from the very serious issue the House has just been debating.  At the end of the summer, the Government gave a commitment to make it easier for Irish companies to apply for public procurement contracts &mdash; essentially, to compete to do work for the State and its agencies.  Each year, up to &euro;15 billion is spent on public procurement contracts.  I am raising this issue because I am frustrated that Ireland continues to be absolutely out of step with practically all other EU member states in terms of the percentage of public procurement contracts awarded to companies outside the member state.  France, Spain and Poland award less than 1% of state contracts to companies from other countries; Italy, Denmark and the UK award less than 2% of state contracts to companies from other countries; and Sweden, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands award less than 3% of state contracts to companies from other countries.  Ireland, by contrast, gives almost 18% of the &euro;15 billion we spend getting things done &mdash; building roads and schools, putting software programmes in place for State agencies and building boats for fisheries protection, etc. &mdash; to companies outside the State.</P>
        <P>This debate is taking place at a time when Irish small and medium-sized enterprises are desperately in need of stimulus and support.  The SME sector employs 250,000 people in areas of the Irish economy like the service and construction industries.  I ask the Government to give the House a progress report on what it has been doing to make it easier for Irish companies to compete in domestic tender competitions.  What has it been doing to prepare and train Irish companies to compete for contracts in other parts of Europe?  I am primarily concerned that we facilitate companies that may seek public contracts in Ireland.  Even in these difficult times, significant amounts of money are being spent on public contracts.  I want to be told it has become simpler and cheaper for companies to participate in tendering processes.  Until recently, Irish SMEs could not enter the tendering process in many cases because it cost so much to do so and they had no certainty of success.  At the moment, companies cannot borrow money to put contracts in place without some certainty of success.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to assure the House that no charge is imposed on companies that tender for the vast majority of public contracts.  I want to know that where appropriate, State agencies are required to send officials to meet people who are tendering for business.  The officials should give them guidance, where possible, and ensure they are competing.  I want reassurance that Enterprise Ireland is helping to support and prepare Irish companies, to ensure they are as competitive as they should be and to increase the percentage of public procurement <Col N="322"/>business obtained by such companies.  Do we have an import substitution strategy for replacing the amount of work that is being done in Ireland by foreign companies with Irish companies, when and where appropriate?  I am not satisfied that is happening.  Small businesses, companies and entrepreneurs in Ireland are going out of business at a time when large contracts are being successfully completed by large multinationals based out of Ireland, even though Irish SMEs have the skill set necessary to do the job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of non-domestic suppliers winning public procurement contracts in Ireland has been the subject of controversy from time to time.  The Deputy referred to a statistic, released by the EU Commission, which suggested that 17% of contracts awarded in 2008 went to suppliers outside the jurisdiction.  This statistic is based on incomplete data relating only to above-threshold procurements where contract notices were published and the nationality of the winning tenderer disclosed.  When one compares the value as opposed to the number of contracts going to non-Irish companies in 2008, the figure amounts to less than 5% of the overall public spend on procurement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not about the value of the contracts.  This is a spin job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures quoted by the Commission do not distinguish between companies based in Britain and those based in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, many of the contracts going abroad may have stayed on the island of Ireland.  As the Deputy will be aware, part of the remit of a North-South institution, Intertrade Ireland, is to expedite trade and business growth across the island.  It offers practical advice and support in targeting new cross-Border business opportunities, obviously in both directions.  The Commission agrees that an alternative interpretation of its figures is that approximately 95% of all procurement by value was from domestic suppliers.  The Deputy will understand that the relevant percentage cannot be predetermined by the Government, but emerges from open and fair competition.  When one is making comparisons, one also needs to take into account the size of the country in question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Why?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Public procurement in Ireland is governed by EU legislation and national rules developed by the Department of Finance.  The most significant development in facilitating the SME sector has been the publication by the Minister for Finance in August 2010 of circular 10/10, which sets out guidelines for public contracting authorities.  The guidelines aim to ensure tendering processes are carried out in a manner that facilitates participation by SMEs and all procurement is carried out in a manner that is legal, transparent and secures optimal value for money for the taxpayer.  They address the concerns of SMEs regarding access to public procurement opportunities and highlight practices to be avoided where they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The new arrangements include greater open advertising of opportunities, with a new threshold of &euro;25,000; a reduced requirement for paperwork, such as accounts, at the early stages of tendering; an instruction that suppliers are not to be charged for access to tender opportunities; an assurance that all criteria used would be appropriate and proportionate; and an instruction that turnover and insurance levels would be set at proportionate levels.</P>
        <P>All these actions are consistent with the recently published EU-commissioned research carried out by GHK on behalf of the European Commission enterprise and industry directorate general, entitled Evaluation of SMEs&rsquo; Access to Public Procurement Markets in the EU September 2010, which recommends actions contained in circular 10/10 in support of SMEs <Col N="323"/>and which notes in its executive summary that SMEs in Ireland secured greater access to public procurement than in other European countries.</P>
        <P>The national procurement service, NPS, seeks to encourage participation by SMEs in the tender competitions it runs.  SMEs that believe the scope of the NPS competitions that may be beyond their technical or business capacity are encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises.  It is envisaged that through such relationships they can participate and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts, agreements or arrangements that result and therefore increase their social and economic benefits.  Larger enterprises are also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs can be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from this tendering exercise.</P>
        <P>Before going to tender, the NPS strategically analyses each category of goods or services to determine the most effective approach to the market, including aspects such as achieving better value for money and SME participation.  In some cases involving low risk, high demand categories of goods, economies of scale and better contracts management can be achieved through the use of a centralised contract, with a reduced administrative burden, which will in itself result in savings.  In other categories of goods, dividing the contract into lots, taking on board our obligations under the procurement directives, is the appropriate process to follow.</P>
        <P>Benchmarking from other jurisdictions confirms that using centralised competitions such as these can result in administrative savings of &euro;6,000 to the contracting authorities availing of such contracts as a result of not having to administer the procurement themselves.  The cost of putting a centralised contract in place is estimated to cost &euro;25,000 but, clearly, the more organisations that avail of the centralised frameworks, the greater the administrative savings to those organisations will be.</P>
        <P>In addition to the work being done by the NPS and the Department of Finance, Enterprise Ireland is running strategic workshops to assist companies, such as management development workshops and strategic and change management programmes.  Enterprise Ireland also offers assistance with exports, management development, lean manufacturing, research and development and overseas offices programmes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It needs to be understood clearly that we cannot revert, when it comes to public procurement, to a pre-1958 model of the economy, or a sort of covert under the table protectionism, which would infallibly lead in short order to expensive lawsuits or tribunals and to investigations by the European Commission.  Neither can the State, when it has to cut expenditure, afford by such a method <i>de facto</i> to subsidise or prop up firms that find it difficult to compete unless the dice can be loaded in their favour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>No one is suggesting that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The allegation and insidious lobbying that everyone is doing it is not a justification.  Many SMEs will need to compete for contracts outside the jurisdiction and across the EU to maintain their viability.</P>
        <P>We cannot be seen to close ourselves off from the EU marketplace by adopting a protectionist stance because in 2009 alone, 80 companies have won &euro;210 million in overseas public procurement opportunities with the support of Enterprise Ireland which has set up a new public procurement section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We want the same playing pitch as other member states.  That is all we are looking for.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="324"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is supporting SMEs generally through the range of initiatives I have outlined but under EU procurement law and the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment, it cannot set out deliberately to discriminate in their favour when tendering for goods and services.  As long as I hold this office, and I am sure my successors will adopt the same attitude, I will insist that procurement practices in the NPS meet the highest standards of integrity without interference from Ministers, lobbyists or anyone else.  It is important for Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as to how we do business publicly.  Public procurement is of great strategic significance to our economy and to the firms operating within it, and for that reason we will always seek to make procurement as user-friendly as possible within the law.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his indulgence.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment on the specifics of budgetary matters in advance of its formal announcement. The Deputy will be aware however that the &euro;8.59 billion current expenditure allocation for my Department for 2010 accounts for some 16% of Government gross voted current expenditure (the third largest after Social Protection and Health). Almost 75% of this current allocation, or &euro;6.39 billion, is accounted for by pay and pensions &mdash; &euro;5.4 billion on pay and just under &euro;1 billion on pensions. The number of employees in the education sector accounts for approximately one third of total public sector numbers, more than 70% of which are teachers and special needs assistants. Non-pay expenditure accounts for the balance of &euro;2.2 billion of current expenditure. This non-pay component covers all areas, from funding for our schools and universities, to support for those students that are less well off; from the cost of providing school transport, to our investment in research and development; and from training allowances on F&Aacute;S and other courses, to day-to-day office running costs. The Government has made it clear that difficult decisions will be necessary across the broad spectrum of public expenditure in order to secure the significant level of savings required. This will obviously impact on sectors of public expenditure, including the education sector. The choices involved in securing significant savings on my Department&rsquo;s Vote are extremely difficult. The Government will, however, seek to ensure that the necessary savings are achieved in a fair and equitable way.</P>

	<P>The Government recently published its five year international education strategy, Investing in Global Relationships, which outlines the strategic importance of international students to the Irish economy, and to long-term business relationships with our current and future trading partners. The USA remains the single most important country of origin for international students in Irish higher education institutions, but the vast majority are here on short-term programmes of one or two semesters.    The US-based Institute of International Education recorded a 19% increase in the number of students studying in Ireland on short-term study abroad programmes in the 2008/2009 academic year, making us the ninth largest destination for US students, and the fastest growing destination after China. In this context, there is clearly potential to attract a greater number of US students to Ireland for full degree programmes.  The education mission was the initial step in a process of targeting prospective students in this cohort. The aim of the education mission was primarily to target high school counsellors, who play a key role in guiding students about their higher education options, in Boston and Chicago and then visit the national conference of high school counsellors in St. Louis. Given the unavailability of a pair in the House, I was unable to travel on the Boston leg, and so the Secretary General of my Department was asked at short notice to lead the delegation.  Once a pairing arrangement was in place, I joined the mission at the earliest possible occasion, leading the Chicago and St. Louis legs. Major engagements included:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Interviews with media outlets, including a group of Irish American media publishers;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />working dinners with current and prospective IDA clients and Irish-American philanthropic organisations in Chicago and with the business and academic community in St Louis;</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />a meeting with the senior leadership of Fontbonne University in St Louis.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">It would not be usual to receive a written report detailing the benefits of Ministerial participation.   However, officials from my Department have met Enterprise Ireland to discuss effective follow-up to the mission, as part of the implementation process for the international education strategy.  </P>

	<P>The Exchequer expenditure figures for October 2010 were published last week.  Education capital expenditure of &euro;456m (including &euro;75m Capital carryover) is running &euro;102m behind profile at present.  The school building budget is less than &euro;50million behind profile.  The substantial reduction in construction prices has meant that my Department is achieving greater value for taxpayers&rsquo; money. Contract prices are now sometimes up to 40% lower than when they were at their peak and a significant proportion of this is an additional reduction on 2009 average prices.  Furthermore, difficulties within the construction industry linked to very low tender prices are creating delays, for example, confirmation of the availability of a bond prior to a contract being awarded is taking much more time. In addition, the costs of sites have been reducing and there have also been some delays in completing planned site transactions arising from legal and planning issues. There are 32 major projects commencing on site in the second half of the year. This is a significant number of sites progressing through tender and to construction.  In total, it is expected that by the end of  2010, 53 new schools  will have commenced  on site  this year. This compares to projects for 34 schools going on site last year.   As I mentioned at the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills in June, I had asked my officials in June to draw up possible contingency plans in the context of the expenditure challenges.  I am looking at possible revised expenditure allocations at the moment to compensate for the softening of expenditure on schools capital within the Department&rsquo;s overall capital budget. The Department&rsquo;s current budget is very tight this year and there is very little contingency available if unexpected expenditure arises in the next eight weeks.  This may arise in the area of pensions for example where a number of late applications for retirement may be received.  Therefore, it may be necessary for me to take a prudent approach and set aside a small amount of the capital budget to cover for recurrent spending contingencies.  This will be kept under constant review.  The main other areas where the Department&rsquo;s capital expenditure is running behind profile are ICT Grants and higher education. In terms of ICT grants, &euro;24million was allocated to almost 3,300 primary schools last week and the funding has issued. There is no underspend in this area. The budget for higher education institutions is some &euro;32million behind profile. This is a matter of the timing of the issuing of payments. It would not be expected at this time of the year that the entire capital budget would be spent. The Government is continuing to roll out a vastly improved infrastructure for those at all stages of their education.</P>

	<P>Improvements in the numbers of students leaving school early have been recorded in recent years. For example, the latest Retention Report published by my Department in November 2009 shows yearly improvements in second level retention rates for both male and female and it shows an  increase in the numbers of boys completing Leaving Certificate within six years of entry from 73%  for those who entered in 1995 to 77% for those who entered in 2001. The <Col N="328"/>corresponding figures for females were 84% to 86% respectively.  Similarly, the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) conducted by the Central Statistics Office shows a decrease in the proportion of male early school leavers from 18.0% in 2002 to 14.4% in 2009 while the proportion of female early school leavers decreased from 11.2% to 8.2% over the same period. My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school leaving. Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central elements of DEIS, the action plan for educational inclusion. Targeted interventions include the School Completion Programme, Home School Community Liaison services, additional funding for pupils at risk of early school leaving and alternative curricular options.  The School Completion Programme (SCP) currently targets approximately 36,000 young people, in 124 projects across the country. The programme targets more male than female students, which reflects national trends on school completion. With this in mind, gender specific interventions have been developed to cater for the separate needs of both boys and girls. The programme places an emphasis on the development of Sports clubs as well as recreational and extra curricular activities which specifically engage the interests of boys. Officials of my Department have recently commenced discussions with the Irish Sports Council with a view to developing this work.   My Department has also widened the range of curricula available to students by promoting the Junior Certificate Schools Programme, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme in addition to the traditional Junior and Leaving Certificate curricula. I would like to assure the Deputy that we have greatly intensified our efforts in recent years to keep more young people in school and I will continue to prioritise further progress in this area.</P>

	<P>The Renewed Programme for Government was agreed in October 2009 and significant progress has been made since then in delivering on the twenty-seven commitments contained in the programme relating to my Department. My Department has a significant role to play in relation to another eleven commitments that are the lead responsibility of other Government Departments. The programme is intended to provide the political basis for Government action until 2012.  To date, a number of important commitments have already been achieved or are underway. These include commitments in relation to the roll out of Project Maths, the review of initial teacher education programmes, the review of the manner in which Special Needs Assistants are allocated, the integration of the Home School Community Liaison Scheme, the School Completion Programme and the Visiting Teacher for Travellers Service under the National Educational Welfare Board.  There are other commitments in respect of which significant progress has been made. These include the objective of completing a Higher Education Strategy to deliver a longer term vision and shorter term policy objectives for that sector. I can assure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the commitments in the renewed programme, insofar as resources will allow. This was made clear at the time the renewed programme was announced. Given the deterioration in the public financial position, the Government has stated that difficult decisions will be necessary across the board, in the context of formulating the budgetary position for 2011 and for the period up to 2014. In relation to my own Department this requires a full review of all elements of education expenditure, including those mentioned in the Programme for Government. This is being done as part of the budgetary <Col N="329"/>process, which the Deputy will appreciate is carried out on a strictly confidential basis. It would, therefore, not be appropriate for me to comment on specific issues in advance of the formal announcements involved.  The Government will, however, seek to ensure that necessary expenditure savings are achieved in a far and equitable way.</P>

	<P>While the Cromien Report contained a wide range of recommendations it is  important to stress that the report was discursive in nature and in some  instances presented a range of options for further consideration. For this  reason defining the precise number of recommendations is not a clear cut task  but it would be fair to say that there are in the order of 80 recommendations  and my Department has in whole or in part implemented 60. That is not to say  that 20 remain to be implemented. On the contrary many of these have been  overtaken by events or in some instances rejected by my Department in favour of  alternative approaches.</P>
        <P>In June 2001 the Government approved a programme of structural reform of the  Department arising from some of the recommendations in Mr. Cromien&rsquo;s report. The main elements of this structural reform were:</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>i. <?oasys _ix ?>The establishment of the State Examinations Commission.</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p2- ?>ii. <?oasys _ix ?>The establishment of a National Council for Special Education.</P>
<P el="5">iii. <?oasys _ix ?>The establishment of a framework of regional offices of the Department of  Education and Science.</P>
<P el="5">iv. <?oasys _ix ?>The enactment of legislation, to extend the remit of the Higher Education  Authority to co-ordinate and fund the Institutes of Technology.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">A network of 10 regional offices was established under the auspices of a  Directorate of Regional Services. However, following a review of the Regional  Office operations in 2009 it was decided to cease the service in early 2010 and  to re-allocate staff to priority work in the Department.</P>
        <P>Officials are allocated work in their current offices and deal with certain  priority issues such as the National Drugs Strategy, Limerick Regeneration and  Dormant Accounts as well as other priority areas. The Department continues to  be represented on key strategy national committees such as the Rapid Programme.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>In addition to the reforms approved by Government arising from the Cromien  Report, the Department has introduced regulatory reform and appellate processes  to under-pin key allocation functions that are in line with the tenets of the  Report such as:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of an independent Appeals Boards in connection with teacher  allocations at primary and post primary levels.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of a School Transport Appeals Boards.</P><Col N="330"/>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of the National Teaching Council to promote and support  teaching as a profession at both primary and post primary level.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of the National Education Welfare Board in 2002.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Student Support Bill 2008 which when enacted will provide for an appeal  process to enable students/parents that are dissatisfied with the outcome of an  application to appeal the decision.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">My Department in recent years in order to achieve greater efficiencies has set  up a Central Payroll Division, catering for approximately 70,000 school based  employees, along with a web based online claims systems for primary and second  level schools.</P>
        <P>These measures represent the main structural reforms made by my Department in  the last ten years. My Department has submitted an initial &ldquo;Action Plan for  Change&rdquo; to the Department of Finance with modifications to certain areas of  operation in accordance with the terms of the Croke Park Agreement.</P>
        <P>In addition to this my Department is currently participating in the third phase  of the Organisational Review Programme (ORP). The ORP is a public service  modernisation initiative under the auspices of the Department of the  Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the ORP is to review the current and likely future capacities of  individual Government Departments and major Offices in the three key areas of  developing strategy, managing delivery and conducting evaluations.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 85 together.</P>
<P>As part of Budget 2010, the Government announced the creation of a &euro;20 million Labour Market Activation Fund, intended to deliver 3,500 places on training and education programmes for the unemployed.  Its objective was to stimulate innovation in the provision of training and activation measures for jobseeker&rsquo;s seeking to up-skill and get back into work. The Fund is being targeted to specific priority groups among the unemployed: the low skilled, and those formerly employed in declining sectors &mdash; construction, retail and manufacturing sectors, with particular emphasis on the under 35&rsquo;s and the long-term unemployed.   In order to leverage to maximum effect the potential of the market for efficient and value-for-money delivery of full or part-time education and training provision, an open tender competition was launched in March 2010. Some 370 tenders were received from public, private, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations, demonstrating a level of response and quality of proposals that exceeded the <Col N="331"/>most optimistic expectations. Offers of funding were initially made to 26 organisations (Phase 1 projects).  On 5th August, an additional allocation of &euro;12 million, was made available by the Department of Education and Skills, enabling funding to be offered to 33 additional projects (Phase 2).  This brought total funding to &euro;32 million for 59 projects proposing to provide up to 12,000 education and training places for the unemployed (see Appendix A for list of these courses).  Twenty-six projects providing for over 6,500 education and training places, in all geographical regions, benefited from the initial fund of &euro;20 million. In the main, Phase 1 projects are meeting their interim targets. As of mid-October some 3,441 or 52% of Phase 1 places were already filled, with further courses coming on stream between November 2010 and January 2011. On the basis of current information, it appears that the targets for places to be provided as set out in tenders by projects can be largely met. Thirty-three projects providing for some 5,400 places in all geographic regions benefited from the second tranche of funding allocated in August.  Many projects are still in the process of recruiting participants, and some have yet to sign contracts with the Department of Education and Skills.  It is therefore not possible yet to state the total number of beneficiaries from the Fund.  Contractual terms provide for payments to projects in three tranches &mdash; 40% on contract signature, 30% six weeks after programme start subject to achievement of interim activity and expenditure targets, and 30% on programme completion subject to achievement of education and training provision contracted for.  As of end October 2010, &euro;8.4 million had been paid to projects.  It is anticipated that by year&rsquo;s end some &euro;18 million will have been drawn from the Fund.  The balance, &euro;14 million, represents the liability to projects for payments that fall due during 2011, subject to them meeting the delivery terms of the contract. </P>

	<P>The Government has decided to reduce the overall number of VECs from 33 to 16 and to merge particular city and or county VECs. Implementation of these changes will be carried out by officials of my Department working directly with the VECs and other stakeholders.  This project will have a timeframe for implementation of approximately 18 months. Many of the detailed aspects of the restructuring, including the number of administrative staff which each of the new VEC entities will have, will fall to be considered and worked through by my Department in conjunction with the VECs involved in any one merger before decisions are taken.  Implementation will involve consultation with the unions representing employees in the sector and other stakeholders. The Croke Park Agreement provides the basis upon which the precise detail of staff redeployment will operate and will be worked through in consultation with the unions that are a party to that agreement.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Deputy will appreciate that the preparation of the Budget is carried out on a strictly confidential basis and as a result it would not be appropriate for me to comment specifically on this matter in advance of the formal announcements involved. The Government has made it clear that difficult decisions will be necessary across the broad spectrum of public expenditure in order to secure the significant level of savings required. This will obviously impact on sectors of public expenditure, including the education sector. The Government will, however, seek to ensure that the <Col N="334"/>necessary savings are achieved in a fair and equitable way.  I can, however, confirm for the Deputy that I am very supportive of the SNA scheme. It has been a key factor in both ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers applied to my Department for large scale capital funding for an extension. In accordance with the published criteria for large scale building projects, the project for this school has been assigned a Band 2 rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including this project, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie. The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in the light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of this project at this time.</P>

	<P>General Government policy is that public service pensions in the non-commercial semi-State sector are administered on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) basis and the pre-funding for pensions in this sector is via the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF). Following a Government Decision (S29075C) concerning certain universities&rsquo; and non-commercial State Bodies&rsquo; schemes, the F&Aacute;S closed superannuation scheme was converted to a Pay-As-You-Go scheme. The F&Aacute;S closed superannuation scheme relates to former employees of ANCO who made contributions to a Fund that was managed by F&Aacute;S. The assets of the Fund were transferred to the NPRF on 31 December 2009 on foot of a Transfer Order made under the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. As the scheme is now administered on a PAYG basis, the question of a deficit does not arise.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has published its report on the Review of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) Allocation to Schools April 2009-March 2010 on its website www.ncse.ie.  The NSCE has since carried out a number of further reviews of SNA <Col N="335"/>allocation of schools, bringing the total number of schools reviewed as at September 2010 to 3,056. Of this number, 2,363 were primary schools, 588 post-primary schools and 105 were special schools.  To date, 9,829 SNA posts have been reviewed and 9,395 SNA posts remain in the schools concerned. 434 SNA posts have been withdrawn from schools &mdash; in these cases, either the students for whom the posts were originally allocated had left the school or the students&rsquo; care needs had diminished over time.  Of 2,363 primary schools reviewed 1,261 schools had no change in their SNA level, 704 had a decrease in SNA level, and 398 schools had an increase in their SNA level.  Of 588 primary schools reviewed 304 schools had no change in their SNA level, 158 had a decrease in SNA level, and 126 schools had an increase in their SNA level.  Of 105 special schools reviewed 54 schools had no change in their SNA level, 29 had a decrease in SNA level, and 22 schools had an increase in their SNA level.  The full updated report will be published by the NCSE shortly on its website www.ncse.ie. A small number of schools remain to be reviewed and the NCSE has indicated that these will be reviewed early in the 2010/11 academic year. There are currently in excess of 10,000 SNAs in schools compared with just 300 in 1997.  I wish to emphasise that the criteria governing the allocation of SNA posts has not changed, and that SNA posts continue to be retained, and new posts sanctioned, where the care needs of pupils meet the criteria for the scheme.</P>

	<P>I can confirm to the Deputy that there was a significant reorganisation of the Planning and Building Unit of my Department in 2008.  This reorganisation involved the development of expertise in relation to forward planning of future school accommodation needs, the acquisition and implementation of a Geographic Information System, the development of an inventory of school accommodation, the establishment of a dedicated site acquisition team and the establishment of a team to oversee the delivery of modular buildings in areas of rapid population growth.  Improved cooperation with local authorities in relation to identification of areas of population growth as well as identification and acquisition of suitable sites for additional school accommodation has also been facilitated by the new structures.  I have previously announced that I have asked the officials in the Planning and Building Unit to explore new methods of delivery of projects. I have recently announced the involvement of Louth County Council in the management of the delivery of a school building in Drogheda and I look forward to announcing projects to be delivered by certain VECs in the coming weeks. County Monaghan VEC is already advancing with a major project in this regard.  The current structures in the Planning and Building Unit will be kept under review and will be changed as needed in the light of experience. </P>

	<P Just="Left">I support the provision of digital content for schools including the availability of text books on-line for both <Col N="336"/>primary and post primary schools.  As the Deputy will be aware, learning related digital content can take several forms such as content created by publishing companies for use in schools, learning content available on the national education portal site Scoilnet and content created by and shared among teachers and students. The availability of high-quality curriculum-related digital resources continues to be a priority under the ICT in Schools Programme of which on-line text books is an important component.   My Department is committed to working with the Irish educational publishing industry and, with the Industry&rsquo;s co-operation and initiative, a number of demonstration projects and initiatives are already underway in schools.   The Smart Schools Report recommends that the National Centre for Technology in Education, the technology sector and the education publishers explore the development of world class digital educational content.  The Report also recommends that the NCTE should work with both public and private organisations to make the wealth of digital archives that are available accessible to schools.  The NCTE and officials in my Department have held a number of meetings with publishers in order to progress these recommendations.  The ICT Advisory Group, set up by my Department and which includes Industry representation, is currently examining, through its committee on digital content, how digital textbooks can be designed: what level of interactivity they should have and how teacher or student-generated content can add to the resource.  The question of costs for any desirable digital learning resource  such as  textbooks remains unresolved.  The cost of textbooks has traditionally been borne by parents and students.  The Irish industry own the Intellectual property rights &mdash; unlike other countries where education authorities own the content and, consequently, can save money by quickly switching to online delivery as is the case in California. However, a simple digitised textbook is not the best answer in a 21st century learning environment where interactivity and student-generated content is desirable. In Europe the educational publishing industries are working to determine what an interactive digital learning resource should be and how it will be priced and offered to its market.  European Schoolnet &mdash;  a network of 31 Ministries of Education and of which Ireland is an active member &mdash; are currently establishing a working group to propose solutions to these issues.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to work with the publishers and other suppliers of digital content to ensure that new and exciting forms of digital content will be accessible for schools.</P>

	<P>The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department&rsquo;s website. In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at the 30 September of each year. While the staffing schedule allocates on the basis of an average number of pupils each individual school decides on how to arrange its classes.  The latest available international comparisons as published in Education at a Glance 2010 relate to 2008.  A direct comparison is not easily done due to differences in methodology used in different countries. This OECD publication <Col N="337"/>shows the pupil teacher ratio for Ireland at primary level at 17.8 compared to the OECD average of 16.4. The pupil teacher ratio for Ireland at post-primary level is 12.8 compared to an OECD average of 13.7.  The Government is currently working on the estimates process for December&rsquo;s budget. We will also be setting out in some detail our budgetary plans for the next 4 years. It is only by taking the difficult decisions now that we can ensure that our economy returns to growth again. This will put the delivery of our public services on a more sustainable basis rather than on our current reliance on borrowed money. My Department cannot give any guarantees in relation to budgetary impacts on education. Clearly, my Department as one of the large spending Departments will have to play its part in the budgetary process. However, as a Government we will be doing our best to minimise the impact for front-line public services. </P>

	<P>The HEA report on progression rates in higher education highlighted a number of  factors that strongly influence the likelihood of a student&rsquo;s progression from  first year into second year.  The factor found to most influence likely  progression from first year into second year is the prior educational  attainment of the student, with good performance in Leaving Cert mathematics  particularly increasing a student&rsquo;s chances of successfully progressing into  second year of their higher education course.  This finding again underlines  the importance of improving the standard of mathematics at second level and a  number of steps are being taken to advance this key objective educational  policy objective.</P>
       <P Just="Left">The Project Maths initiative, which, is designed to encourage better understanding of Maths, to reinforce the practical relevance of maths to everyday life and to ensure better continuity between primary and second level, and junior and senior cycle, began in all schools in September 2010, building on a pilot in 24 schools which started in 2008. It will be implemented on a phased basis over the period to 2015, supported by comprehensive investment in professional development for teachers, including the provision of post graduate programmes.  Its work will also be supported by an industry-education partnership, the Project Maths Implementation Support Group, which submitted its report to me earlier this year. Some &euro;5m is being invested in Project Maths in 2010, building on &euro;3m in 2009. This investment will continue on an ongoing basis to at least 2013, with the post graduate programmes continuing thereafter in line with demand. The introduction of a scheme of bonus points from 2012 for university entrants who take higher level Leaving Certificate Maths was also announced in October 2010.  DIT and the Board of the Institutes of Technology Ireland have also expressed support for the introduction of bonus points for maths which I hope will also encourage the take up  of higher level maths by students.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 96 together.</P>
<P>Last year, the Government introduced the F&Aacute;S Work Placement Programme (WPP) to provide valuable work experience to graduates and non-graduates who are unemployed. The Work Placement Programme provides up to 9 months work experience to unemployed individuals and is open to employers from all sectors of the economy, including the private, public and the community and voluntary sectors. Under the criteria of the programme, potential participants are informed that participation is voluntary and unpaid.  However, participants may be able to retain their existing social welfare entitlements for the duration of their placement, subject to individuals satisfying the qualifying requirements of the Department of Social Protection. The programme was reviewed in November 2009, with revised criteria coming into operation from 1st December 2009. The revised criteria considerably increased the accessibility of participants and providers to the programme. The purpose of the Work Placement Programme is to ensure that unemployed individuals are kept close to the labour market and are given the opportunity to enhance their future employment prospects. The programme provides an opportunity for unemployed individuals to enhance existing skills and also to develop new skills in a real work environment so that they will be better positioned to avail of future employment opportunities in the labour market. The programme provides the unemployed with the opportunity to take up a placement in their chosen occupation and gain valuable experience or to work in another sector that may hold better future employment prospects. There are two streams under the programme, the first is for unemployed graduates who have attained a full award at level 7 or above on the National Framework of Qualifications. The second stream, is open to all other unemployed individuals.  Since the start of the programme a total of 2,200 people have commenced a placement under the programme. However, as of the 27th October 2010, 1,463 participants were on the programme, 692 on the graduate stream and 771 on the non-graduate stream.  It should also be noted that there are a further 1,369 placements potentially available to be filled, 674 on the graduate stream and 695 on the non-graduate stream. My Department is monitoring the progress of the Work Placement Programme on an ongoing basis to ensure that the programme meets the requirements of the unemployed, including unemployed graduates. This is also feeding into further policy and programme development work in the labour market area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 90 together. </P>
        <P>Pupil numbers at both primary and post-primary level continue to increase.  The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department&rsquo;s website. In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at the 30 September of each year. Unlike other areas of the public service schools can continue to fill these teaching posts in the normal manner. While the primary staffing schedule allocates on the basis of an average number of pupils each individual school decides on how to arrange its classes.  The Government is currently working on the estimates process for December&rsquo;s budget. We will also be setting out in some detail our budgetary plans for the next 4 years. It is only by taking the difficult decisions now that we can ensure that our economy returns to growth again. This will put the delivery of our public services on a more sustainable basis rather than on our current reliance on borrowed money. My Department cannot give any guarantees in relation to budgetary impacts on education. Clearly, my Department as one of the large spending Departments will have to play its part in the budgetary process. However, as a Government we will be doing our best to minimise the impact for front-line public services.  In relation to the issue of employment of newly qualified teachers, my Department recently issued a reminder to school authorities calling on schools to give priority to newly or recently qualified teachers when making appointments for periods of substitution and other temporary appointments.  It is the policy of my Department that only qualified personnel should be employed by schools. Circular 40/2010, which issued earlier this year, directs schools to ensure that teachers proposed for appointment to publicly paid teaching posts are registered with the Teaching Council and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which they are proposed. Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, which has not yet been commenced, provides that only registered teachers can be remunerated out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. While it is still the aim of the Minister that all teachers in schools be registered with the Council (and therefore fully qualified), it is apparent that to commence Section 30 as it stands could have a serious negative impact for a small number of schools where, in specific circumstances, unqualified personnel are required in the short term. Section 12 of the Education (Amendment) Bill 2010 is necessary for the amendment of Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act to allow for the employment, only in certain exceptional and limited circumstances, of persons who are not registered teachers under the Act.</P>

	<P>The Government acknowledges unemployment is a significant problem and is committed to tackling it. It should be noted that the Quarterly National Household Survey from Q2 2010 shows that 75% of those who are unemployed possess PLC or lower qualifications and unemployed people with 3rd level education account for 21%. It should also be noted that people with higher skills and education attainment are more employable and therefore more likely to secure employment. The Government in order to minimise the drift into very long-term unemployment has decided to prioritise four priority cohorts of the unemployed. The four cohorts who are most at risk of becoming distant from the labour market, are:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />People with low skills or education levels;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />People who are on the Live Register for over one year;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />People who are under 35 years of age,</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />People who were previously employed in the construction, manufacturing and wholesale/ retail trade.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">Recent graduates therefore mainly fall into the priority cohort of under 35 and can avail of priority access to training and education opportunities that are available to the unemployed. However, the Government does recognise that at present there is a lack of employment opportunities for young graduates entering into the labour market, and therefore many young graduates may become distant from the labour market without relevant work experience. To address this situation the Work Placement Programme (WPP) was introduced last year. This programme provides participants with a nine month work placement and it is aimed at graduates and non-graduates. The programme offers participants the opportunity to apply their knowledge and develop their skills in a working environment.  The programme has been promoted to graduates at various college graduate fairs, several Grad Ireland sponsored events, and via relevant graduate publications and websites.  To date 1,106 graduates have commenced under the programme. My colleague Minister O&rsquo;Keeffe has also introduced a number of initiatives for graduates to gain valuable work experience and to retain a talented pool of graduates in Ireland. This year Enterprise Ireland introduced two initiatives to support graduates, including, <Col N="341"/>the Graduates 4 International Growth (Pilot Programme) and the Enterprise Ireland International Graduate Programme. The Graduates 4 International Growth (G4IG) programme, which was launched on 30 August 2010, aims to place 50 top-level college graduates in export-led Irish firms. It is 18 months in duration, with participants based for a minimum of 12 months in an overseas market. It has a strong focus on action learning and project work coupled with skills modules on relevant topics such as cultural diversity, market development/strategy, sales and marketing. The programme matches graduates who show potential with ambitious internationally trading companies and provides them with a structured means of developing new skills in business development, while also delivering a key project for the companies involved. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s International Graduate Programme involves a placement of 2 years. This programme aims to provide 15 graduates with in-depth overseas marketing and business strategy know how. Graduates with primary and post-graduate degrees across disciplines such as business, social science, science, manufacturing technology and engineering who would like to make a career in international Irish businesses are eligible. Graduates taking part in the 2010 International Graduate Programme commenced working in their overseas locations on 27 September. Applications for the 2011&ndash;2013 programme will be invited in October 2010 and the closing date will be 31 January 2011. The Government remains committed to addressing Ireland&rsquo;s unemployment problem and continues to actively explore new measures including internship and upskilling programmes for graduates.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82, 124 and 164 together.</P>
<P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, I am not in a position to comment on budgetary proposals. Speculation on any decision in relation to student registration fees is just that, speculation.  The Student Services Charge is levied by the Higher Education institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and student services. Students eligible under the means-tested student grant schemes do not have to pay this charge. It is paid on their behalf under my Department&rsquo;s student grant schemes in addition to any maintenance grant and tuition fee support they are entitled to. Some 43% of undergraduate students fall into this category and do not have to pay the charge. The Government is conscious however, that for those in income groups just above the grant eligibility threshold, any increase in the charge would be an important affordability consideration. However, research also indicates that a range of complex factors that extends beyond financial barriers, such as societal and cultural issues, parental and teacher expectations and previous academic attainment, are also factors that impact on the participation rate of various income groups. Participation growth in Irish higher education has <Col N="342"/>been significant over the past three decades, with the number of new entrants almost trebling in that period. The expansion of higher education opportunities continues to be an important policy priority for government. In the last three years higher education institutions have sought to respond to the increases in demand from school leavers and adults returning to education, including unemployed people, by increasing the number of full time places they offer and also by expanding part time and other flexible types of provision.  The Government is committed to ensuring that opportunities to engage in higher education continue to be made available to potential learners and that access to higher education will continue to be determined by a student&rsquo;s ability and not their financial circumstances. A key challenge for the development of the sector will be in enabling it to meet future demand on a sustainable funding basis, without compromising on quality. A widening of the funding base for the sector, to reduce the relatively high level of dependence on the Exchequer, is one of the issues to be considered in that context. </P>

	<P>The reorganisation and reform of F&Aacute;S and of the State&rsquo;s provision of training and employment services is a process that I initiated over a year ago. The first phase involved the putting in place of a stronger board and corporate governance structure in F&Aacute;S and this was provided for in the Labour Services (Amendment Act), 2010. The second phase, announced by the Taoiseach, involves the division of responsibility for training and employment programmes and services between the newly mandated Departments of Education and Skills and Social Protection. These changes will improve the delivery of employment, training and community services to the public by bringing together related responsibilities in these areas. The Employment Programmes and Services and Skills Training (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order of 2010, which came into force on 1 May 2010, provided for the reallocation of responsibility for F&Aacute;S as an Agency and its related funding from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to the Department of Education and Skills.   The Department of Social Protection will, following the commencement of the relevant sections of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010, assume funding and overall responsibility of F&Aacute;S employment services and employment programmes.    The Social Welfare and <Col N="343"/>Pensions Bill, 2010, which is due to be published shortly, will provide for the full transfer of F&Aacute;S employment services and employment programmes to the Department of Social Protection and this would include the transfer of relevant F&Aacute;S staff, property, land as well as certain rights and responsibilities to that Department.  This will amend the Labour Services Act, 1987. In the period between the commencement of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 and the commencement of the relevant sections of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, 2010, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) will be put in place between the Department of Social Protection and F&Aacute;S. Officials from my Department, F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social Protection are working closely together to advance this agenda. The third phase involves the re-structuring and re-mandating of F&Aacute;S as a world-class skills and training provider.  I met with the Board of F&Aacute;S this morning to discuss its proposal for a new training agency.  Work has commenced on this process and will continue in tandem with the integration of the employment programmes and employment services into the Department of Social Protection. </P>

I can confirm that an interim report in respect of the TBG Learning programme JobFit has been received in my Department.  These reports indicate that training activity and expenditure are in line with expectations for the programme. The JobFit programme is being delivered in the following locations in Dublin: at Blanchardstown, Smithfield and Tallaght; as well as in Athlone, Castlebar, Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford.  In excess of 900 participants commenced the programme, 174 of whom have already completed it.  To date, 70 participants left the programme to take up employment, while another 18 participants went on to pursue Further/Higher Education opportunities.</P>

	<P>There are currently 90 personnel employed in temporary full-time positions in primary schools and 150 employed in regular part-time posts that are in receipt of the unqualified rate of pay.  There are 92 personnel employed in temporary and regular part-time positions in secondary, community and comprehensive schools at present that are in receipt of the unqualified rate of pay.  These figures do not include people employed on a casual substitute basis or those employed in place of teachers in the vocational education sector. It is the policy of my Department that schools should only employ people who are on the register of teachers maintained by the Teaching Council. An integral part of the registration process is an assessment of a person&rsquo;s qualifi<Col N="344"/>cations. Unqualified personnel should not be appointed except in the most exceptional circumstances and then only when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted.  This should only be for quite limited time periods. Earlier this year my Department directed schools that persons proposed for appointment to publicly paid teaching posts must be registered with the Teaching Council and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and the post.  Only where an employer can satisfactorily demonstrate that every reasonable effort has been made to recruit an appropriately qualified and registered teacher, an unqualified or unregistered person may be recruited pending the recruitment of an appropriately qualified and registered teacher.  In addition, a reminder recently issued to school authorities to prioritise qualified teachers, particularly newly or recently qualified teachers, when making substitute and other temporary appointments.  I believe that first call must be given to teachers who are not in work and I appreciate the efforts of those schools who have responded positively to date.</P>
        <P>The Education (Amendment) Bill, currently before the House, will provide for the first time for regulations to limit the engagement of unregistered people and will require schools to prioritise the employment of registered teachers over unregistered people while still ensuring that schools can operate.</P>

	<P>The Report Smart Schools Smart Economy sets out a range of recommendations which are designed to strengthen the integration of ICT in teaching and learning in primary and post primary schools.  The Report recommends an investment of &euro;150m over 3 years to improve the ICT infrastructure, expand professional development for teachers, enhance the digital content available in support of the curriculum and provide enhanced broadband for schools.  The Report welcomes the ICT framework which has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  This sets out a structured approach for schools in using ICT.  It identifies objectives, learning outcomes and learning opportunities for students across the system which will support students to create, communicate and collaborate, think critically and creatively, and develop the skills to use ICT in a variety of formats. </P>
        <P>Since November last year over &euro;67m has been provided in ICT grants to schools to assist them to reach the recommended baseline of ICT equipment. Schools are being asked to prioritise their investment to ensure that each classroom is equipped with a teaching computer, a long range wireless mouse and keyboard, and a fixed digital projector, and that, at second level, ICT equipment supports Project Maths, and specialist classrooms or laboratories for subjects with practical dimensions, such as science and technology.  In relation to educational reforms, as revised syllabuses come on stream in senior cycle, it is national policy to strengthen the ICT dimension and embed five key skills &mdash; information processing, communications, critical and creative thinking, working with others and being personally effective.  A second assessment component is also being included to strengthen practical, project and portfolio assessment.  This is important in promoting critical skills such as communications, planning, research and <Col N="345"/>evaluation.  Of the 34 Leaving Certificate subjects available, 18 are now assessed through oral, practical, project or portfolio work in addition to a written examination.</P>
        <P>Leaving Certificate Technology and a revised syllabus in Leaving Certificate Design and Communications Graphics, both of which include significant Computer Aided Design elements, were examined for the first time in 2009. A major programme of reform is also under way under Project Maths in both junior and senior cycle.  In addition to national programmes of professional development, a range of evening courses are being provided for teachers to show them how to use readily available software to teach geometry, trigonometry and statistics for both Junior and Leaving Certificate.  On-line resource materials are also being provided for teachers and students.</P>
        <P>A review of junior cycle by the NCCA is currently under way.  The Council has been asked to advise on the scope for reform which would provide for a more active learning experience for students, promote real understanding, creativity and innovation, and provide for appropriate evidence of learning in a context where the Junior Certificate is no longer being a high stakes environment.  The Council has published a paper Innovation and Identity &mdash; Ideas for a new Junior Cycle, which set out a range of possible directions for change, and has launched a public consultation process on the matter.  The feedback from the consultation process, together with reviews of international practice, will inform the proposals which the NCCA will make.  These will be presented at a symposium to be organised by the Council towards the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Schools are also working actively to promote enterprise education as an examinable component of the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, within the curriculum in Business Studies, through such initiatives as Mini-Company in Transition Year and within the Leaving Certificate Applied programme.  In 2010 some 14500 students participated in the Student Enterprise and Mini-Company competitions, 6000 students took part in the Young Social Innovators Programme.  My Department continues to work closely with the information communication technology industry following on from the publication of the Smart Schools Report last year which was prepared by a Joint Industry Advisory Group.  The Smart Schools Report recommended the establishment of the ICT in Schools Steering Group.  This group is chaired by Paul Rellis, Head of Microsoft Ireland and has met on five occasions.  The group is made up of key stakeholders including Government departments, industry, schools, teachers, students and parents.  The establishment of the Steering Group signifies a strong partnership between the education sector and industry with the shared objective of enhancing ICTs role in the education system.</P>

	<P>The length of time a person can remain on Community Employment (CE) is dictated by a number of factors, in line with the guidelines for CE:</P>
<?oasys _cl14- ?>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />How long they have been in receipt of a qualifying Department of Social Protection (DSP) payment;</P><Col N="346"/>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Whether they are considered job-ready at the end of each year&rsquo;s CE participation;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Budgetary limitations/place availability limitations.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">The maximum participation limits for CE are three years for those under 55 years of age, and six years for those of 55 to 65 years of age.</P>
        <P>Persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-related DSP payment are eligible for one additional year on top of these two limits, i.e., four years for those under 55 and seven years for those of 55 to 65.</P>
        <P>Persons in receipt of a qualifying DSP payment for 12 months (on entry to CE) may participate on CE for one year before having to leave CE and re-qualify, subject to the age-related maximum participation caps above.  In exceptional circumstances, a percentage of participants may be retained for an additional subsequent year, subject to budget limits and personal training needs.</P>
        <P>Persons in receipt of a qualifying DSP payment for three years or more (on entry to CE) may be eligible for up to three years on CE, subject to annual renewal, based on job-readiness assessment and personal training requirements.  There is no entitlement to remain for the 3 years if the person is considered job-ready when assessed by the CE supervisor at the end of each annual contract.  At the end of the 3 years, if fully utilised, the person will have to leave CE.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has indicated that certain CE participants receiving Illness Benefit (previously known as Disability Benefit) and One Parent Family payment have requested and been refused an extension.  However, F&Aacute;S does not gather statistics on the numbers of CE participants refused extensions, regardless of eligibility category or reason for refusal.  The receipt of Illness Benefit or One Parent Family Payment has no bearing on the granting or otherwise of a further year on CE.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year, the Government decided to prioritise four cohorts of the unemployed for support and assistance.  The four cohorts are; the low skilled; those under 35 years of age; those on the Live Register for longer than 1 year and those suffering from structural unemployment in the manufacturing, construction and retail sectors. </P>
        <P>This year, the total number of training and work experience activation places for the unemployed delivered by F&Aacute;S, the Labour Market Activation Fund and Skillnets will be approximately 160,000.  This compares to the 66,000 places that were delivered in 2008.  To facilitate young people, F&Aacute;S is also prioritising services for the under 25s.</P>
        <P>Included in this provision, is the &euro;32 million Labour Market Activation Fund will provide approximately 12,000 activation places for the unemployed.  Almost sixty organisations were successful in the Labour Market Activation&rsquo;s Fund&rsquo;s tendering process, as their proposals had to improve the employabiliy and enhance the skills of unemployed persons from the priority cohorts, including those under 35 years of age.</P>
        <P>Also included is the Work Placement Programme that was launched last year, as a way of providing work experience for the unemployed in a real work environment.  This Programme provides work experience placements for periods up to nine months.  As of 27th October 2,200 people had commenced a placement under the Work Placement Programme.  The total number of participants aged under 25 currently on the programme is 474.</P>
        <P>In relation to redundant apprentices, F&Aacute;S has introduced a number of measures which have assisted over 4,000 redundant apprentices with on and off-the-job training.  A recent initiative was also introduced with the Department of Defence and the Air Corp to facilitate 30 redundant formerly employed in SR Technics to complete their mechanical apprenticeship.</P>
        <P>In addition to the training and employment provision for the unemployed, the State is also investing significantly in the Further and Higher Education sectors. This year the Government is providing 170,000 full time and part time Further Education places and 156,000 full time Higher Education places.  In the Higher Education sector all the programmes covered by the free fees scheme are open to unemployed people.  Specific initiatives for the unemployed include almost 1,800 unemployed people supported on part-time undergraduate and postgraduate programmes from September 2009 in areas of the &lsquo;Smart Economy&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>For early school leavers, there are 6,000 places available under the Youthreach Programme.  The programme provides participants with two years integrated education, training and work experience.  The programme facilitates early school leavers with opportunities to acquire certification and progress to further training or employment</P>
        <P>In addition to providing increased education and training places, the Government has adopted measures to encourage and incentivise unemployed people under 25 years of age to participate in full time education or training.  Unemployment benefit has been reduced to &euro;100 per week for those unemployed under 23 and to &euro;150 per week for those aged 24 and 25. <Col N="348"/> However, as an incentive to upskill them, should these individuals participate in  full time education and training programmes then they will receive the full normal weekly allowance of &euro;196.</P>
        <P>This Government will continue to explore all possibilities in relation to supporting young unemployed individuals.</P>

The Government has made it clear that difficult budgetary decisions will be necessary across the broad spectrum of public expenditure in order to secure the significant level of savings required.  This will obviously impact on all sectors of public expenditure, including the education sector.  The Government will, however, seek to ensure that the necessary savings are achieved in a fair and equitable way, and that the important role of the education system in the future of the economy is recognised. </P>

<P>In 1998 the overall participation rate in higher education was 44%.  By 2004 it had risen to 55%.  The HEA estimates that in 2007 participation rose to 64% of the relevant age cohort.  A target of 65% has been set by the National Access Plan for 2013 and a target of 72% by 2020.</P>
<P>In 1998 mature students represented 5% of entrants to higher education; in 2006 this had increased to 13%.  A target of 20% by 2013 has been set in the National Access Plan 2008-13.</P>
<P>In 1998 just 23% of young people aged 17-19 from a socio-economic disadvantaged background entered higher education.  By 2004 this had increased to 33%.  A new target of 45% participation by 2020 has been set in the National Access Plan 2008-13. </P>
        <P>A mid-term review of the Plan is currently underway and it is intended that this will be completed by the end of 2010.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 129 and 175 together.</P>
        <P>The process of assessing and paying third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the timing of payment varies between the 66 awarding authorities depending on a number of variables including the volume of applications received, staffing resources and whether or not properly completed application forms have been submitted.  Work prioritisation across different functions, and how available staff are deployed to execute those functions are matters for the management of each VEC and local authority concerned.</P>
        <P>This year&rsquo;s student grant schemes include a number of significant administrative and service improvements aimed at addressing the issue of delay, which include an initial roll-out of a new online grant application system.  The new system, introduced in both Irish and English, is already operating in 11 grant awarding authorities. Building on this initial phase for the current academic year, the ultimate aim will be to make it available to all applicants nationally.</P>
        <P>Key among the other improvements introduced are a complete overhaul of the grant application form, streamlined administrative processes, advance payments to awarding authorities and publication of the grant schemes some two months earlier than last year.  The Student Support Bill, which will provide for a fundamental and radical restructuring of the whole student grants administration function and provide for a single unified scheme is now listed to be taken at Committee Stage on 25 November 2010.</P>
        <P>A number of amendments to the Bill relating to legal and policy issues have arisen since Second Stage.  These are being finalised with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office.</P>
        <P>In addition, possible options for a more significant centralisation of functions have been explored in line with the Government&rsquo;s wider programme of public service reform and it has been decided that the grants function will be administered by a single Grant Awarding Authority.  The intention is to have any amendments arising from the Government decision on this issue sufficiently advanced with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office to be dealt with at Committee Stage to prevent any further delay in the passage of the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The following table attached details the number of new student grant applications received, fully processed, refused, the number paid and the percentage processed by the local authorities and Vocational Educational Committees for the 2010/11 academic year as at end October 2010.  It should be noted that the difference between the numbers of new applications received and the numbers fully processed include incomplete applications and those submitted without the required supporting documentation.  The information has been supplied to my Department by the local authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.  Information in relation to the number of appeals made to grant awarding authorities is not collected by my Department.</P>

	<P>As I have previously outlined to the Deputy, the Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of analysing all areas in the country in order to determine the level of additional provision which will be required at both primary and post primary level up to 2017.  Overall post-primary requirements in the East Cork area will be considered in this context. </P><Col N="353"/>

	<P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to supporting education in schools under Protestant management, while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. In this regard, I had a useful meeting with Protestant educational representatives on 9 September last.  At the conclusion of that meeting, we agreed to continue our discussions on funding issues pertaining to Protestant fee-charging schools.  Since then, my officials have had further meetings with the educational representatives and will continue to do so. I am committed to continuing this engagement with members of the Protestant community, as I believe that these issues are best resolved collaboratively.</P>

The Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance was reduced by 4.1% and  the participation bonus by 18% in the December 2009 budget.</P>
        <P>However, CE participants continue to receive a &euro;20 per week participation bonus  over the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance while gaining worthwhile work experience and  certified training customised to their individual needs, as identified through  their Individual Learning Plan (currently amounting to &euro;500 p.a., per  participant for relevant training). In addition, the CE Return to Education  budget provides additional funds to enable participants to improve their basic  literacy and numeracy skills.</P>

	<P>The reorganisation and reform of F&Aacute;S and of the State&rsquo;s provision of training  and employment services is a process that I initiated over a year ago.</P>
        <P>The first phase involved the putting in place of a stronger board and corporate  governance structure in F&Aacute;S and this was provided for in the Labour Services  (Amendment Act), 2010.</P><Col N="358"/>
        <P>The second phase, announced by the Taoiseach, involves the division of  responsibility for training and employment programmes and services between the  newly mandated Departments of Education and Skills and Social Protection. These  changes will improve the delivery of employment, training and community  services to the public by bringing together related responsibilities in these  areas.</P>
        <P>The Employment Programmes and Services and Skills Training (Transfer of  Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order of 2010, which  came into force on 1 May 2010, provided for the reallocation of responsibility  for F&Aacute;S as an Agency and its related funding from the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Innovation to the Department of Education and Skills.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection will, following the commencement of the  relevant sections of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010,  assume funding and overall responsibility of F&Aacute;S employment services and  employment programmes.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, 2010, which is due to be published  shortly, will provide for the full transfer of F&Aacute;S employment services and  employment programmes to the Department of Social Protection and this would  include the transfer of relevant F&Aacute;S staff, property, land as well as certain  rights and responsibilities to that Department.  This will amend the Labour  Services Act, 1987.</P>
        <P>In the period between the commencement of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous  Provisions) Act 2010 and the commencement of the relevant sections of the  Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, 2010, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) will be  put in place between the Department of Social Protection and F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department, F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social Protection are  working closely together to advance this agenda.</P>
        <P>The third phase involves the re-structuring and re-mandating of F&Aacute;S as a  world-class skills and training provider.  I met with the Board of F&Aacute;S this  morning to discuss its proposal for a new training agency.  Work has commenced  on this process and will continue in tandem with the integration of the  employment programmes and employment services into the Department of Social  Protection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The key aim of the Transition Year Programme is to provide for a strong focus on personal development, collaborative and experiential learning, learning in the community and work experience. The programme is also designed to enable students to experience a wide range of educational inputs, and sample subjects which have not been taken at lower second level. It is a maturing process and a chance to engage in group work, project work and self directed learning.  Schools are free to devise a flexible modular programme within an overall framework set out by the Department of Education and Science. Within this context, there is scope within the social outreach aspects of the programme for initiatives such as engaging with the elderly to be pursued. Initiatives promoting inter generational solidarity have been provided in the past in programmes such as Transition Year, and some 6000 students annually take part in the Young Social Innovators Programme.  Within the overall framework set out by the Department for Transition Year, decisions on the format and content of the programme to be offered are made <Col N="359"/>locally by schools, and this will continue to be case.   I am satisfied that there are key benefits from promoting inter-generational solidarity and co-operation in a way which meets social awareness and communications objectives of the Transition Year Programme. However, it is also important that schools have the flexibility to provide for school based innovation and creativity in the development of the programme.  Organisations wishing to promote initiatives in this area are welcome to arrange for the development of Transition Units, using the module descriptor format which has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for this purpose. These can be progressed in consultation with the NCCA and the Co-ordinator of the Transition Year Programme within the Professional Development  Service for Teachers. </P>

Accordingly, the Board of Management were advised that in the circumstances it would be appropriate to make the Caretaker post in respect of the facility redundant. I am advised that as part of the examination of the operation of the facility, it is both the Department and the school authorities understanding that the facility is used on a pay per play basis with their being no membership fees, no club officers nor rules/constitution that would normally be expected of a Club. I am advised that to date expenditure this year, including salaries and running costs, comes to approximately &euro;47,000.

	<P Just="Left">The information requested by the Deputy on the number of special needs assistants employed in primary, special and post primary schools in Dublin City and County is not readily available. The number of Special Needs Assistants employed nationally in each of the past five years and on 30th September 2010 is available in the following table. The details for each of the past five years are the December figures for the year in question. The primary schools information is inclusive of the special schools details.  As the Deputy may be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) took over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs in 2005. Under these arrangements, the NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) process applications from schools for additional supports such as teaching and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support at primary and post primary level. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. SNAs are allocated to schools to enable them to support pupils with disabilities who also have significant care needs. The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils and the changing needs of the pupils. While SNA posts may be allocated to schools in line with my Department&rsquo;s criteria, SNA posts may also be adjusted where a child may leave or move school, or may achieve a greater level of independence.  The National Council for Special Education may be able to assist the Deputy with information regarding the number of special needs pupils benefitting nationally. I wish to confirm for the Deputy that my Department is very supportive of the SNA scheme. It has been a key factor in both ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes.</P>

	<P>In 2004, agreement to amalgamate was reached by the two primary schools in the area referred to by the Deputy. Due to accommodation concerns the amalgamation did not progress at that time.  A technical inspection was carried out on the existing school buildings to determine which would be suitable to accommodate the amalgamated school. The report following this inspection concluded that neither of the locations would be suitable.  The progression of this building project and the acquisition of a site required to facilitate the amalgamation, will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Arts education (visual arts, music and drama) is one of the seven curriculum areas that comprise the primary curriculum, which was revised in 1999.  Therefore all primary school children have access to an arts programme. At second level there are approved syllabuses for Junior Certificate in Music and Art, Craft and Design.  In the senior cycle there are syllabuses in Music and Art.  Modules in the Arts are also available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied.  In the Transition Year programme, schools offer a variety of modules which stimulate pupils&rsquo; interest in the Arts in general and which, in many cases, give them the opportunity to interact with practising artists in their own classrooms and in other contexts. In addition to supporting curricular provision for the arts at primary and second level, my Department aids the arts through the provision of some 68,000 teaching hours to a number of schools of music operated by VECs and through co-operation (teaching) hours to VECs which support work with other institutions.  In addition, two Music Education Partnerships are funded in Donegal and Dublin City VECs. A further initiative in Music for young people of school age will shortly be launched by Music Generation, a subsidiary company of Music Network, supported by donations from U2 and the Ireland Funds.  The Artists in School  Guidelines, developed jointly by the Arts Council and my Department, and issued to all schools in 2006, are an important resource in informing schools of how best to plan, implement and evaluate partnerships with local artists and organisations which will provide stimulating and interesting learning experiences for children. This type of initiative <Col N="364"/>could be further strengthened through work experience programmes in schools for arts graduates. The Public Service Agreement 2010-14 provides that there will be full support in the Civil Service and State agencies for programmes and initiatives to support and assist the unemployed, including the F&Aacute;S Work Placement Programme.  It should be noted that the FAS scheme is structured on the basis of applications being made to FAS directly by those offering a work placement.  The programme has been made available to VECs and higher education institutions.  Arrangements for schools to participate in the programme are currently under consideration.  </P>

Enrolments at post-primary level in Navan have increased in recent years.  These post-primary schools serve up to 20 primary feeder schools. Based on the numbers feeding through from the primary feeder schools it would appear that enrolments will continue to increase in the short to medium term.  The Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of analysing all areas in the country in order to determine the level of additional provision which will be required at both primary and post primary level up to 2017. Overall accommodation requirements in the Navan area will be considered in this regard.  The progression of all large scale building projects arising from Forward Planning Section&rsquo;s analysis will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the School Transport scheme was approved by Government as a topic for inclusion as part of the 2009-2011 round of Value for Money Reviews.  This review looked at the original objectives of the scheme, whether these objectives remain valid today, the extent to which the objectives are being achieved, and whether there are possibilities for economies or efficiencies that would improve the value for money of the scheme. In this context, the review also looked at fundamental issues such as eligibility criteria and catchment boundaries, with a view to achieving efficiencies and value for money in the Scheme.  While the report of the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme, which will outline the recommendations of the Steering Committee on catchment boundaries, has recently been finalised, it is to be considered by Government in advance of publication. </P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.</P><Col N="368"/>
        <P>Schools apply to their local SENO for SNA resources as new pupils who would qualify for such support are enrolled or as the changing care needs of existing pupils emerge. The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils and the changing needs of the pupils. While SNA posts may be allocated to schools in line with my Department&rsquo;s criteria, SNA posts may also be suppressed where a child may leave or move school, or may achieve a greater level of independence.</P>
        <P>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Rainwater harvesting systems were first introduced for major school building projects in 2008. Since then all major school building projects, where site conditions and circumstances allow and where economically viable to do so, can incorporate a rainwater harvesting system into their brief.  While fitting the systems in new schools during construction is relatively straightforward, retrofitting them in existing schools is much more difficult and expensive because of the various dedicated pipe work systems both within the building and externally underground and the amount of making good work that is required in each instance.</P>
        <P>For existing buildings it is more cost effective to minimise the demand for water firstly through installing measures to reduce water usage such as push type spray taps, low flushing toilets, urinal controls, repairing leaks etc. To this end, as part of the Summer Works Scheme 2010, schools were invited to apply for Water Conservation measures and I recently announced a list of schools whose applications under this scheme were successful.  This list is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>The application of wind energy schemes in schools has been explored by my Department and the results indicate that given the scale of application to match demand and capacity in a meaningful way, schools are better to connect to one of the main wind energy electrical suppliers to maximise the potential of green electricity.  It must be remembered that a sustainable solution involves the matching of a sustainable resource with the end users&rsquo; needs and not just the application of the resource.  The situation with regard to wind energy is kept under review given improvements in technology and in the market place.</P>

	<P>One of the main objectives of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in <Col N="369"/>attending regularly.  The school transport scheme which is operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on my Department&rsquo;s behalf is a very significant national operation involving about 42 million journeys and over 82 million kilometres on 6,000 routes every school year. The service is delivered using a mix of Bus &Eacute;ireann, both school transport and road passenger vehicles, private contractor vehicles including private operator scheduled services, and Dublin Bus, Irish Rail, DART and LUAS where practical.</P>
        <P>In line with the Programme for Government, my Department in consultation with Bus Eireann and other Departments is actively considering how vehicles which provide services under the School Transport Scheme could feasibly be utilised to provide other services that would benefit the wider community after children have been brought to school in the morning and before they are collected from school in the afternoon.  Consideration of such arrangements will not impinge, however, on the core function of the scheme, namely the provision of school transport for families availing of transport under the School Transport Scheme or the standard of these services.</P>

	<P>Procedures for the appointment of Special Needs Assistants (SNA) are set out in Department Circulars 05/2001 and SNA 03/03. These Circulars specify that the minimum qualification necessary for appointment as an SNA is an award of Grade D (or pass) in Irish, English and Mathematics in the Intermediate Certificate/Junior Certificate or Day Vocational Certificate Examination or in an examination of equivalent standard.  In this context, a qualification of equivalent standard is any qualification at Level 3 or higher on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) established by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), provided that the qualification, or a combination of such qualifications, certifies to the achievement of a minimum <Col N="370"/>of a pass in the subjects Irish, English and Mathematics.  With regard to the means by which a person may attain the necessary educational requirements, local education service providers (e.g. Vocational Education Committees) may be able to assist with access to an appropriate course or courses which will, on successful completion, lead to an award of the required standard.</P>

	<P>As part of Budget 2010, the Government announced the creation of a &euro;20 million Labour Market Activation Fund, intended to deliver 3,500 places on training and education programmes for the unemployed.  Its objective was to stimulate innovation in the provision of training and <Col N="372"/>activation measures for jobseeker&rsquo;s seeking to up-skill and get back into work.  The Fund is being targeted to specific priority groups among the unemployed: the low skilled, and those formerly employed in declining sectors &mdash; construction, retail and manufacturing sectors, with particular emphasis on the under 35&rsquo;s and the long-term unemployed. In order to leverage to maximum effect the potential of the market for efficient and value-for-money delivery of full or part-time education and training provision, an open tender competition was launched in March 2010.  Some 370 tenders were received from public, private, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations.  Offers of funding were initially made to 26 organisations. My Department has subsequently, in August, made funding available to a further 33 projects. This was an EU-wide procurement process and was conducted according to European Union public procurement principles. These require that providers throughout the EU are afforded the opportunity to participate in the competition.  Tenders were assessed by an independent Committee of experts, lead by the Chairperson of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. The Committee included representatives of Enterprise Ireland, the HEA, FAS, Pobal, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Education and Skills.  TBG Learning were among 26 organisations initially selected for funding. It is a UK-based training provider which has been contracted to provide programmes of 12 weeks duration for 1,500 unemployed people under the Labour Market Activation Fund. The company is wholly owned by the Rehab Group. The JobFit programme includes training elements, such as FETAC level 3 courses in Preparation for Work, work placements with local employers and assistance with searching for a job. TBG has recruited over 80 tutors to deliver its programme nationwide. All were resident in Ireland when recruited, and while they include a number of nationalities, are predominantly Irish citizens.  JobFit staff hold a range of qualifications relevant to their roles, and many have worked in Ireland in the community, education, training, voluntary and business sectors. They have a broad range of expertise and understanding of these sectors, and an extensive network of local contacts in the communities in which they work. The capacity to deliver accredited programmes to the unemployed, including components to assist and advise participants in preparing for employment such as career guidance, are elements that would have been take into account in the accreditation of the programme being offered. Therefore, on that basis, I would not have concerns about the provider in this regard.  TBG Learning has over 25 years&rsquo; experience in the UK of providing programmes like JobFit, for people who are unemployed, and seeking to enter or re-enter the workforce. Some 30,000 people benefit each year from the training and support provided by TBG Learning, with 2,500 people walking into jobs, 16,000 people gaining qualifications and others progressing onto further education.  I am satisfied that the programme being delivered by this provider represents good use of public monies having regard to all of the elements of the programme including, in particular, the benefits to the participants in terms of acquisition of skills, work experience and a recognised award on completion.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, all of our schools are required to have in place a Code of Behaviour and this code must be drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB).  The NEWB guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and that schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that  bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school&rsquo;s bullying policy.</P>
        <P>Every school therefore must have in place, a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of the school&rsquo;s overall school code of behaviour. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
        <P>My Department has also issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour.  These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.</P>
        <P>As a further aid to post primary schools, my Department published a template that can be used by post-primary schools in developing an anti-bullying policy.  The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour.  However, it also takes account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes, and <Col N="378"/>reference is made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school, as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established and at that level that actions should be taken to address allegations of bullying.</P>
        <P>There is no requirement for local school authorities to report incidents or allegations of bullying to my Department.  My Department does receive a number of complaints and queries from parents regarding matters such as bullying, involving schools.  It important to highlight that in many of these instances, parents are seeking guidance from the Department on how to resolve an issue or an alleged incident within a school.  In dealing with complaints the Department&rsquo;s role is to provide advice to parents and students on the operation of schools&rsquo; complaints procedures and to clarify for parents and pupils how grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed.</P>
        <P>When a Whole School Evaluation (WSE) is conducted by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, the code of behaviour, including its anti-bullying policy is  reviewed by the inspection team to check that it is in line with the Department&rsquo;s guidelines. Inspectors normally meet with the principal, the board, post-holders, year heads, class teachers, programme co-ordinators, the pastoral care team, representatives of the students and parents.  During these meetings there is a particular emphasis on the quality of student care and support.  The inspectors&rsquo; evaluation is also informed by observations in classroom settings and throughout the school.  Where there are weaknesses in a school&rsquo;s policy or implementation of policies clear recommendations for improvement are made and are included in the published report of the inspection.</P>
        <P>Revised procedures for WSE in primary schools have recently been put in place.  A new element of the revised WSE process involves the issuing of questionnaires directly to pupils and parents.  Children and parents will be asked to respond to questions about how the school deals with bullying, discipline in the school and whether or not the school provides a safe environment for children. This enhanced engagement with parents and pupils through questionnaires aims to further support all schools to implement effective measures to counter bullying.  The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum.  SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>Since 2001, national professional development support services have provided ongoing support to schools in planning policies on child protection and the code of behaviour and in supporting teachers and principals in the implementation of SPHE.  In addition, training on The Stay Safe Programme is offered on an ongoing basis to primary schools.</P>
        <P>Other measures in place include the Webwise Internet Safety Initiative, the EU Safer Internet Programme campaign and the establishment of the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) which is currently working with over 70 Post Primary Schools to promote and support positive student behaviour.</P>
        <P>As the ranges of measures in place demonstrate, my Department is strongly committed to ensuring that schools tackle bullying in all of its forms.</P>

	<P>It is expected that by the end of 2010, major building projects for 53 schools on the school building programme will have commenced on site this year.  This compares to projects for 34 schools going on site last year and is therefore a 56% increase in on site commencements compared to last year.  There are nearly as many major building projects going on site in the second half of this year as in the whole of last year.  </P>
        <P>Of the 52 projects announced earlier this year to go to tender and construction, all are being proceeded with: 26 are at an advanced stage of architectural planning, 24 are at tender stage and 2 are currently under construction.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169, 170 and 171 together.  </P>
        <P>Each national school has an allocation of learning support/resource teacher hours to assist schools in making appropriate provision for pupils with learning difficulties and high incidence special educational needs.  Each post-primary school has an allocation of learning support teaching hours.  It is a matter for school authorities to determine how these hours are utilised to support eligible pupils. My Department does not hold details of the percentage of students being supported through this mechanism. However, it can be assumed generally that pupils who perform at or below the 10th percentile on a standardised test of reading and/or mathematics would qualify for such support.  Pupils with more significant needs may qualify for additional teaching and special needs assistant support through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support students with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.</P>
        <P>Additional teaching and SNA supports are allocated as necessary by the NCSE in line with my Department&rsquo;s policy to support children with special educational needs. Additional teaching resources are sanctioned by the NCSE in respect of all eligible schools.</P>
        <P>The NCSE has advised my Department that additional resource teaching hours were in place in schools in the 09/10 school year in respect of over 34,000 pupils.   A county by county breakdown of these hours is not readily available in my Department.</P>
        <P>There are currently over 9,000 resource and learning support teachers employed in mainstream schools, over 500 teachers in special classes and over 1,100 special school teachers.</P>
        <P>As the number of special needs school places would include those in receipt of learning support, it is not possible for my Department to advise of the number of school places allocated for children with special educational needs.  I have arranged for a list of all special classes and special schools to be sent to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The most recent projections used by my Department would see the projected enrolments at post-primary level increase from the current total enrolment  (excluding PLCs) of circa 312,200 pupils to an expected enrolment of between 331,500 and 336,600 pupils by the year 2017. At primary level, the most recent projections would see an increase in enrolments from the current total enrolment of circa 505,600 pupils to an expected enrolment of circa 567,300 by 2017.   It is within this context that the Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of analysing all areas in the country in order to determine the level of additional provision which will be <Col N="381"/>required at both primary and post  primary level up to 2017.   The progression of all large scale building projects arising from Forward Planning Section&rsquo;s analysis will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s School Building and Modernisation Programme.   The staffing position at individual school level is determined by reference to the school&rsquo;s valid enrolment on 30 September of each year.  The criteria for the allocation of teaching posts to schools is based on the staffing schedule which is published annually by my Department.  </P>

        <Quest> if the purchaser of a new property, subject to section 23 or rural renewal scheme tax relief, at a current fire sale price, is <Col N="382"/>entitled to the full scale previously sanctioned tax breaks, based on the original intended sale price, or is this adjusted down to reflect the reduction in the final and actual sale price, or if the original tax concession based on approximately 90 per cent of the construction costs remain unchanged on finished properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The amount of &ldquo;section 23 type relief&rdquo; which is available on any particular rented residential property is always calculated as a proportion of the price actually paid by the purchaser for that property. In essence, a proportion of the cost to the builder/developer, which is attributable to his/her acquisition of the site, is taken outside the scope of the relief. The figure of 90%, in the case the Deputy has referred to in his question, implies that 10% of the total costs to the builder/developer related to site costs. </P>
        <P>In these circumstances, the amount of section 23 relief available would be calculated at 90% of the price paid by the purchaser, whether that be a fire-sale price or otherwise. It is not based on the price at which the property might originally have been on the market. This is on the assumption that all the construction costs were incurred in the appropriate qualifying period since these schemes have by now all been terminated.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the decision on whether or not to search private aircraft at the listed airports is taken following profiling, review of intelligence and interview with the crew/passengers.</P>
        <P>A selection of private aircraft has been targeted in the period in question, involving Customs staff assembling a profile of the aircraft and passengers, undertaking covert surveillance and interviewing connected persons. However, it is not appropriate to publish precise details of such enforcement activities as this could prejudice current and future operations.</P>
        <P>In line with best practice in customs administration worldwide, Revenue regards the development of information and intelligence as critical to the detection of evasion and drug smuggling. This is very important in the case of Ireland and other EU Member States where the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.  Of specific relevance is the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers <Col N="383"/>moving within any part of the EU.  The approach has, of necessity, been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling.</P>
        <P>The Table sets out the number of Customs checks overseeing all aircraft and flights at the listed airports for the period in question. Attendance by Customs officers is selective and targeted and is based on analysis of seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators as well as specific intelligence.  A drugs detector dog is frequently in attendance.  Flights with origins and destinations with a high-risk rating attract particular interest.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Customs Officers are not permanently based at Ireland West, Carrickfinn, Sligo, or Galway Airports.  Customs controls at such airports are risk-based and are carried out by Revenue enforcement staff on mobile patrol. Attendance by these officers is selective and targeted and is based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators. Attendance can also be as a result of specific intelligence. Flights with origins and destinations with a high-risk rating attract particular interest. These attendances cover the full range of flight times and are kept under constant review in particular to take account of emerging smuggling trends and any traffic increases at these airfields. A drugs detector dog is frequently in attendance.</P>
        <P>In addition to drugs enforcement work, other duties are undertaken by officers in attending airports/aerodromes, including controls against the smuggling of excise products, the clearance of aircraft and passengers arriving from third countries, spot checks on EU flights and checks on private aircraft.</P>
        <P>In line with best practice in customs administration worldwide, Revenue regards the development of information and intelligence as critical to the detection of evasion and drug smuggling. This is very important in the case of Ireland and other EU Member States where the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.

The approach has, of necessity, been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling.  Up to the end of October 2010, Customs staff carried out a total of 1,744 checks on the Airports at Ireland West, Carrickfinn, Sligo, and Galway.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the position is as follows: Mineral oil that is used for the generation of electricity is exempt from Mineral Oil Tax (excise duty on mineral oils), and natural gas used for that purpose is exempt from the Natural Gas Carbon Tax introduced with effect from 1 May 2010.</P>
        <P>The VAT treatment of natural gas used in the generation of electricity depends on whether the gas is imported through the natural gas distribution system or sourced on the home market. The importation of natural gas through the natural gas distribution system is exempt from VAT in accordance with paragraph 13 to Schedule 1 to the Value Added Tax Act, 1972.  Natural gas sourced on the home market and hydrocarbon oil of a kind used in the generation of electricity are subject to VAT in accordance with paragraphs 17(3) and 17(4) respectively of Schedule 3 to the Value Added Tax Act, 1972.  However, as the onward supply of electricity is subject to VAT, deductibility is allowed in respect of the VAT incurred on inputs.</P>

	<P>The National Public Procurement Operations Unit has been renamed as the National Procurement Service (NPS) since early 2010, and has within its remit the organisation and procurement of goods and services commonly used across the public service.</P><Col N="387"/>
        <P>
<?oasys _fc ?><i>Energy</i></P>
        <P el="0" Just="Left">Given the significant expenditure on energy across the public service, the NPS has targeted this category as one appropriate for particular market intervention.  The energy market comprises six sub-markets: Electricity; Natural Gas; Automotive fuel &mdash; through a procurement charge card; Bulk Liquid Fuels &mdash; Petrol, Diesel and Central Heating Oil; Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) &mdash; Bottled Gas; Solid Fuel.  The NPS is involved in each one of these sub-markets, as follows:</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Electricity and Natural Gas</i></P>
        <P el="0">The NPS has conducted a major consultation process involving all energy stakeholders including: the Commissioner for Energy Regulation (CER); Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; energy providers; and public service clients. Due to the nature of the energy market, the need to encourage greater competition and the potential size of the public service demand, it was apparent that there was a distinct risk that a single public service contract would distort the market. The NPS concluded that the optimum procurement strategy for electricity and natural gas would, therefore, be through the use of multi party framework agreements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NPS conducted an EU competitive tender process, which has resulted in Electricity and Natural Gas framework agreements being put in place on 29 October 2010. These framework agreements cater for all public service sectors for a period up to four years. Mini-competitions will be held for sectoral requirements on an ongoing basis. The NPS has commenced this mini-competition process, with tenders being invited from the framework participants for the central government sector. This competition will embrace some 950 sites.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Automotive fuel</i></P>
        <P el="0">A contract for the supply of automotive fuel through a procurement charge card to the public service was put in place in May 2009, and will run for a three-year period.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Bulk Liquid Fuels and Liquid Petroleum Gas</i></P>
        <P el="0" Just="Left">The NPS inherited contracts for Bulk Liquid Fuels and Liquid Petroleum Gas from the Government Supplies Agency. These contracts accommodate central government departments only, and will be replaced in 2011 with framework agreements accommodating the broader public service.  The framework agreements will operate with ongoing sectoral mini-competitions along the lines of the electricity and natural gas markets.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Solid Fuel</i></P>
        <P el="0">Traditionally, solid fuel has consisted of coal and turf, for which there is currently insufficient demand to warrant a centralised supply arrangement. As more environmentally friendly or &lsquo;Green&rsquo; alternatives emerge, the need for new procurement arrangements will be considered.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Telecommunications</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Centre for Management and Organisation Development (CMOD) in the Department of Finance has responsibility for telecommunications and technology policies, procurements, and expenditure sanction. CMOD operates multi-vendor procurement frameworks, which have been established, following open EU procurement exercises, for mobile voice and data, and for fixed voice and Voice over IP (VoIP) services. Additionally, CMOD has standardised the <Col N="388"/>procurement approaches to be used by all public bodies for fixed data services. These approaches have made procurement considerably easier for both the public bodies and the vendors concerned. Additionally, procurement and administrative cost savings in the range of 35-50% have been realised &mdash; actual savings are dependent on matters such as the size of the body, its geographic dispersal, user types, user volumes, call and data transfer types, etc. Accordingly, the Government has made it mandatory for public bodies to use these procurement mechanisms and standards for voice and data communications services. As a result of this approach, 16 different telecommunications service providers are connected to Government Networks, and competing to provide services to public bodies.</P>
        <P>Such is the dependence on telecommunications and networking infrastructures that all public bodies now need to ensure resilient provision of telecommunications and data communications service provision. The Department is satisfied that no single telecommunications provider can provide the level of diversity needed.  From 2002-2007, public bodies did procure most telecommunications services under a single contract that had been put in place on foot of an open EU procurement exercise. However, that approach did not yield the types of savings and the innovation of products and services that have accrued from the multi-vendor approach set out above.  Furthermore, it is likely that a single contract approach would lead to considerable contraction in the telecommunications market, as only a small number of companies would be in a position to satisfy all requirements and the geographic spread of public bodies. There is no evidence to suggest that this would result in cheaper prices or greater efficiencies. The experience previously suggests the opposite.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Finally, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), the Department issued a new Circular &ldquo;10/10:Facilitating SME Participation in Public Procurement&rdquo;. This Circular requires all public bodies to award contracts in &ldquo;lots&rdquo;, where this can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money, to be aware of the potential of SMEs as suppliers of innovative solutions, to include smaller businesses, where these could meet requirements or compete for particular lots, and to encourage joint bidding among SMEs and sub-contracting in the case of larger contracts.</P>

A copy of this booklet has been forwarded to the Deputy.  My direct area of responsibility is the Civil Service. The current rates of pay in the Civil Service for general service grades and grades common to two or more Departments are shown in Circular 28/2009 which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Questions about the pay of individual grades in other areas of the Public Service should be addressed to the appropriate Minister.</P>

	<P>NAMA has advised that it is currently reviewing business plans for the largest 30 debtors whose loans it has acquired. Part of that process involves addressing the unsustainable and unrealistic level of debtor overheads which had been permitted by the participating institutions. As part of the debtor business plan process, NAMA has typically required debtors to reduce their business overheads by between 50% and 75%.  These reduced overheads have to cover a broad array of expenses, including salaries for relevant executives. NAMA does not specify the salary of any individual but the level of business overheads permitted by NAMA will reflect the business activity of each debtor and the requisite added value that a debtor can add in terms of achieving the financial and other targets set by NAMA.</P>
        <P>NAMA has a commercial remit to manage its portfolio of over &euro;70 billion and it has to consider, on a case-by-case basis, the overhead costs associated with leaving a debtor in place to manage his business versus the commercial alternative of appointing an insolvency expert. NAMA will, where necessary, enforce against debtors but it is not a cost-free alternative and would not be, in all instances, in the best interest of taxpayers.</P>

	<P>There is no general requirement that companies applying for public contracts provide three year financial statements of accounts. Under public procurement guidelines, contracting authorities are required to ensure that recently established firms, or firms with no previous experience of public contracts, are not excluded from public tendering. It is, of course, essential that contractors performing public contracts be of sufficiently sound economic and financial standing. The general position is that criteria used to determine the appropriate level of financial capacity must be proportionate and relevant to the needs of the particular contract. Various forms of evidence of financial capacity may be sought, such as bankers&rsquo; statements, extracts from balance sheets, proof of access to professional indemnity, public liability and employer liability insurance, performance bonds or demonstrable access to resources of third parties.  My Department recently re-iterated these conditions in guidelines to public bodies which are aimed at facilitating greater participation by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in public procurement opportunities.  As part of these provisions, the documentary evidence need only be produced when a tenderer has been short-listed or is coming under consideration for the award of a contract. </P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the Expert Group submitted its Interim Report to me in early July.  The Government having considered the Report decided to accept all of the recommendations.  I understand that good progress has been made in regard to the implementation of the recommendations.  Since then the Expert Group has been working towards completion of its Final Report.  I am informed that in the next phase of their work, the Expert Group are considering a number of very complex and sensitive issues and are anxious to ensure that the Final report reflects the most thorough examination and informed appraisal of these issues.  This has necessitated extensive consultation with various stakeholders.</P>
        <P>I expect to receive the Report very shortly.</P>
        <P>I plan to bring the latest recommendations of the Expert Group before Government as soon as possible after I receive the Report, after which the Report will be published.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As I have previously said, the management of assets by Bank of Ireland, including the holding or display of artworks, is a matter for the Board of the Bank.  I understand that the Bank&rsquo;s art collection dates back to the early 1970s and its primary purpose was to support emerging Irish artists rather than to create a corporate collection per se.  Many of the important works were already donated to the State through two substantial donations in 1999 and 2008 to the Irish Museum of Modern Art. A further twelve works will be now be donated to the IMMA in advance of the upcoming sale of part of the BOI art collection.</P>
        <P>I am advised that NAMA has no difficulty with a debtor making donations to charity if he has a surplus available after payment of interest, employee salaries, etc. What is not acceptable to the Agency is the making of charitable donations while the debtor is unable to meet debt servicing obligations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 (the &ldquo;Croke Park Agreement&rdquo;) provides a framework for public service management and staff to work together to deliver an ongoing reduction in the cost of delivery of public services, while maintaining and improving the quality of services delivered to the public, in return for commitments on pay and security of employment for public servants.  The Implementation Body has been established to drive the implementation of the Agreement across all sectors and ensure that early, robust and verifiable reforms are secured, which lead to sustainable and verifiable savings in the cost of public service delivery.    </P>
        <P>Against the background of reduced budgets and staffing resources in the health sector, the challenge for the Health Sector will be to not only to maintain the level, quality and safety of services, but to expand the range of services that can be easily accessed by patients and clients in their own communities.  This will require changes in work practices and attendance patterns, as well as in staffing ratios and rostering arrangements in order to increase efficiency, and to achieve significant savings in non-pay fixed costs such as overtime, premium payments and agency spend.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Agreement provides for a wide range of measures to bring these changes about, including the introduction of an extended working day covering the period 8am to 8pm and the introduction of new arrangements to support the delivery of services over an extended period, up to and including 24/7 for all  grades in service locations, where this is identified as needed to meet service requirements (2.9.12 and 2.9.13 of the Agreement).  There is also detailed consultation and adjudication processes to be followed to support the successful implementation of these measures, which are to be completed within very tight timeframes.  It should be noted that with effect from 16 December 2008, all new employees of the HSE and HSE funded agencies are already liable to work rosters necessary to deliver extended services beyond Monday to Friday, including weekends, where flexibility is required to address real service demands.  New employees include existing staff appointed to promotional posts and staff on renewed temporary contracts.</P>
        <P>Each sector was requested by the Implementation Body to provide an action plan as to how proposed changes were to be implemented in their respective sector.  My Department worked closely with the HSE to develop the action plan for implementation of the Agreement across the health sector.  The Health Sector Action Plan is available to view on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.dohc.ie.</i></P>
        <P>The Action Plan recognises that the Public Service Agreement enables the Health Sector to protect services to patients/users, in as far as is possible, within the context of whatever expenditure decisions are made by Government for 2011 and subsequent years.  The Plan also takes account of the fact that the implementation of reform is a dynamic process, and one which will allow identification of changes which may be required in the way services are delivered and the associated changes in work practices, on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>The Implementation Body also established the Health Sector Implementation Body (HSIB), a joint union/management group with an independent Chair, Mr. Pat Harvey.  The HSIB is responsible for driving the implementation of the Action Plan and will be required to report on progress to the Implementation Body.  The HSIB has met three times to date, with further meetings scheduled later this month and again in December.  Local structures are also being put in place at regional level across the HSE, which will mirror those of the Health Sector Implementation Body.</P>

	<P>I met with the Jack and Jill Foundation on Tuesday 12th October last.  The Health Service Executive was also represented at the meeting.  We discussed a range of issues including additional State funding.  I will continue to engage with the Jack and Jill Foundation.</P>
        <P>Both the Minister and I and the Health Service Executive recognise the valuable contribution that the many agencies and charities make in the provision of health and personal social services to people with a disability. Reflecting the current economic situation the health sector must manage service levels within available resources.  The HSE together with the &lsquo;non-statutory organisations&rsquo; who provide services on behalf of the HSE, will continue to review how these services are provided in order to protect the delivery of front line services as much as possible.  In the current environment, this is a challenge for all, including the HSE and non statutory charity organisations.  The HSE will continue to work closely with all agencies and bodies in the sector, including Jack and Jill, to provide whatever assistance it can from within its resources, in the context of the annual Service Level Agreement arrangements.</P>
        <P>The very difficult financial position facing the country will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure, including the disability sector. Notwithstanding this difficult financial environment, the Government is determined to do everything possible to protect patient services, to respond to priority demographic and other needs, and to support ongoing reform of the public heath services within the resources available for health.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>On 1 November 2010 I announced that the Government has decided to approve a voluntary early retirement scheme and a voluntary redundancy scheme for certain categories of staff in the public health service.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the schemes is to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate health service reform. The Government has decided that funding of up to &euro;400m will be made available in 2010 to fund the up-front costs of both schemes.</P>
        <P>The VER and VRS schemes are open to employees management and administrative staff and general support staff but priority will be given to management and administrative grades. The exact grades covered by the two schemes are set out in detail in the relevant Circular (Circular 7/2010).  There is general acceptance of the need to reduce the numbers of management and administrative staff in the health service. For that reason, all applications from management and administrative staff to avail of the schemes will be approved.   Approval for applications from support staff will depend on the numbers of management and administrative staff who apply and the overall cap on costs not being breached.</P>
        <P>I am happy to report that there is a high level of interest in the schemes. However it is not possible to predict, as yet, to what extent the current level of enquiries will translate into actual applications ahead of the closing date of 19 November.  The HSE already have a process in place to track and monitor applications around the country and across services which will allow them to identify areas where service gaps may emerge and to address them.  The HSE and health service employers will be looking to the provisions of the Croke Park agreement to   ensure they continue to deliver services with reduced numbers and I understand that an engagement with the relevant trade unions has already begun.</P>
        <P>While the implementation of the schemes will challenge the health service over the coming months, I believe that it will lead to a more efficient health service in the long term.</P>

	<P>Narcolepsy is not an eligible condition under the Long Term Illness Scheme. There are no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions covered by the scheme.</P>
        <P>Under the Drugs Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than &euro;120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
        <P>In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 252 together.</P>
        <P>The new Childcare Education and Training Scheme (CETS) was introduced in September of this year and is being implemented by my Office, on behalf of FAS and the Vocational Educational Committees (VECs) under the Department of Education and Science in place of their previous childcare support schemes.</P>
        <P>Under the previous FAS and VEC schemes, qualifying students and trainees were given a weekly Childcare Allowance of up to &euro;63.50 per child as a contribution to their childcare costs.  Under the new scheme, qualifying students and trainees can avail of childcare places free of charge and almost 3,000 full-time equivalent childcare places have been contracted in some 600 services throughout the State.  This is the same number of places as previously provided for and places have been selected on the basis of information provided to my Office by FAS and the Department of Education and Skills.  The eligibility criteria are unchanged and continue to be determined by FAS and the VECs.</P>
        <P>Childcare services which were already in contract with my Office under either the free Pre-School Year under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme and/or the Community Childcare Subvention scheme, were written to in June of this year and invited to apply for entry to the CETS scheme with effect from September 2010.  Applications were returned to the City and County Childcare Committees in the first instance and then forwarded to my Office for approval.  I understand that the service in question was not a participant in either the ECCE or Community Childcare Subvention scheme at that time and did not apply to enter the CETS scheme.</P>
        <P>As the CETS scheme replaced two previously existing childcare support schemes, a flexible approach has been taken to ensure that the allocation of places matches the demand in each area from student and trainees with childcare requirements.  This  has included some adjustments being made to the initial allocation of places since the scheme commenced in September and, in some cases, the inclusion of services which were late in applying for entry.  I understand that my Office has no record of an application having been received from the service referred to by the Deputy.  However, should the service make a late application to my Office to enter the scheme, it will be processed and advised of the outcome in a matter of days.  Assuming the service in question is admitted to the scheme, it would be open to the qualifying FAS trainee referred to by the Deputy to avail of the childcare support through this service.</P>

	<P>My Department operates a number of Lo-Call numbers. It is in general the practice of the Department to publish both Lo-Call and standard landline contact information together thus enabling callers to use whichever number is appropriate based on their individual contractual arrangements with mobile telephony providers. Given the variety and rapid changing nature of such contractual arrangements, I do not believe that it is appropriate to place the warning mentioned by the Deputy. </P>

	<P>Strong provisions are in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard.  Because of concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, further provisions were brought forward to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 also provides the Garda&iacute; with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.</P>
        <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to the Garda&iacute; to tackle misuse of alcohol.  Garda&iacute; have the power to seize alcohol to prevent underage drinking in public places and to forestall public disorder or damage to property.  Garda&iacute; may also issue fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place.  These notices are a more efficient and effective use of Garda resources and avoid court proceedings when an offender pays the penalty.</P>
        <P>One of the policing priorities which I set for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2010 was to achieve the maximum levels of safety for local communities.  Following on from this, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policing Plan for 2010 includes as one of its key actions the reduction of public disorder, assaults and criminal damage by focusing on a range of measures.  These include identifying and proactively targeting local &lsquo;hot spots&rsquo;, a faster response to reports of public disorder and antisocial behaviour, adopting a low tolerance stance to alcohol and drug related anti-social behaviour and youth crime, the introduction of a youth crime case management system.  The Garda&rsquo;s Operation Encounter has been in operation since 2002 to target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, and it specifically targets offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988.  In the region of 615,000 offences have been detected since the commencement of the Operation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na participate fully in the joint policing committees established in each local authority area, all of which attach importance to combating anti-social behaviour in their areas.</P>
        <P>CCTV plays an important role in supporting the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in deterring anti-social behaviour.  Garda CCTV systems are deployed at a wide range of locations through<Col N="408"/>out the country on the basis of operational needs.  In addition, my Department has provided financial assistance towards the capital costs of establishing community-based CCTV systems.</P>
        <P>The Garda Adult Cautioning Scheme enables warnings to be issued to offenders in certain circumstances (specified by the Director of Public Prosecutions), instead of their being prosecuted.  This reduces the volume of cases prosecuted through the courts by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and allows less serious offenders, who are considered unlikely to re-offend, to have their cases dealt with expeditiously.  It also forces offenders to confront the reality of the offences they have committed.  Most of the offences covered by the Scheme are public order and anti-social behaviour offences and include offences under the Public Order Act 1994.</P>
        <P>Tackling youth crime is a key priority for this Government.  The Government&rsquo;s policy on youth crime is set out in detail in the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008 &mdash; 2010.  This strategy is underpinned by the principles of the Children Act 2001, as amended.  The approach adopted involves the deployment of Garda juvenile liaison officers, community Garda&iacute; and the use of measures such as the Garda Diversion Programme, Garda youth diversion projects, young persons probation projects and community sanctions, in addition to the incremental process of warnings, good behaviour contracts and anti-social behaviour orders under the Criminal Justice Act 2006.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works very closely with local authorities in enforcing the provisions of housing legislation in respect of anti-social behaviour by persons provided with local authority housing and related matters.</P>
        <P>Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, and Part 13 of the Act relates to anti-social behaviour by children.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour.  For children, these range from a behaviour warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court, and for adults they provide for a behaviour warning and a civil order.</P>
        <P>The range of legislative, policy and operational measures which target anti-social behaviour, including those provided for in the Criminal Justice Act 2006, are under constant review by my Department, in consultation with other relevant Departments and the Garda authorities.</P>

	<P>Tackling youth crime, including antisocial behaviour, is a key priority for the Government. The Government&rsquo;s policy on youth crime is set out in detail in the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010. This strategy is underpinned by the principles of the Children Act 2001. The approach adopted by the Government involves an incremental process of diversion from the formal criminal justice system, community sanctions as alternatives to custody and detention as a last resort. In the case of anti-social behaviour the diversion process includes the use of warnings, good behaviour contracts and anti-social behaviour orders, where appropriate.</P>
        <P>This approach confronts youth crime and related behaviours in an incremental way.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, especially Juvenile Liaison Officers and Community Garda&iacute;, operate the Garda Diversion Programme. They have the support of 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects across the country. These community based projects, which are funded by the Irish Youth <Col N="409"/>Justice Service and delivered in collaboration with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and voluntary youth organisations, have a clear role in intervening to challenge bad behaviour and to promote good behaviour. The projects have re-focused their approach to tackling the offending behaviour following the publication in 2009 of a study by the Irish Youth Justice Service on designing effective local responses to youth crime. This report is  available on the IYJS website. The implementation of the reports findings are well advanced and are specifically designed to target behavioural change in the children attending the projects.</P>
        <P>There are strong legal provisions in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  They provide the Garda&iacute; with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.  Garda&iacute; have the power to seize alcohol in the possession of an under 18 year old which they suspect is for consumption in a public place.  They can also seize alcohol where they reasonably believe that there is the danger of public disorder or damage to property and require the person to leave the place. Garda&iacute; may also issue fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place.  These notices are a more efficient and effective use of Garda resources and avoid court proceedings when an offender pays the penalty. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works to reduce public disorder by identifying and proactively targeting local hot spots and responding quickly to reports of public disorder and anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>A proposal for &ldquo;dedicated antisocial behaviour units&rdquo;, referred to by the Deputy was mentioned in a recent newspaper article. The article appears to have overlooked the key role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling anti-social behaviour which I have outlined above and it also appears to have misunderstood the role of Garda Youth Diversion Projects. I have no plans for the establishment of such units.</P>

        <QRef>[41091/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 156 and 157 of 24 June 2010, a percentage of decisions made by Visa Officers are reviewed weekly by a more senior official.  While the number of visa applications fluctuate from week to week, on average 10% of decisions are selected for review.  While records are not kept in such a way as to indicate definitively the number of such  reviews which have resulted in a change to the original decision, I can inform the Deputy that the number of such changes is very low.  The purpose of the review is to assure the quality of the Visa Officers&rsquo; work and to ensure that all guidelines are being adhered to; there is also a training and mentoring aspect to this approach.  A percentage of each Visa Officer&rsquo;s decisions are selected with the aim of ensuring that weekly reviews cover all visa categories &mdash; study, visits, join family, business and events.</P>
        <P>Where processing issues are identified during these reviews, these are discussed by the Visa Processing Supervisor and the Visa Officer concerned, the goal being to raise awareness of the need to adhere strictly to the guidelines throughout the processing stage.  If necessary, the original decision is changed from refusal to grant of visa, or vice versa. An added safeguard is <Col N="410"/>in place in that, at any stage during the processing procedure, Visa Officers may refer applications to their Supervisor for a second opinion in order to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that a correct decision is reached.  This is particularly the case in instances where matters of a more complex nature arise or where no previous precedent arises.  It should also be noted that refusal decisions are generally made on the basis of a number of refusal reasons within the application.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, where an applicant is not satisfied with the decision at first instance, it is open to that applicant to lodge an appeal of the decision to refuse a visa within two months of the date of refusal.  A visa appeal is free of charge to the applicant.</P>
        <P>As with all visa applications in all countries worldwide, the central concern is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country&rsquo;s vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time not placing unnecessary or unreasonable obstacles in the way of those who intend travelling for legitimate purposes and who are likely to abide by the terms of their visa.  Each visa application is decided on its individual merits and every effort is made to achieve this balance.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Irish visa regime operates in exercise of permissive powers conferred on the Minister by the Immigration Act 2004 and the Immigration Act 2004 (Visa) (No.2) Order 2009.  The visa processing guidelines and procedures are administrative in nature, are widely publicised on our website, and are essentially based on experience, investigation and verification of the information provided by each applicant, cooperation and information sharing with the immigration services of other countries, best practice and local knowledge.  They are not specifically provided for in either primary or secondary legislation.  The Immigration Residence and Protection Bill 2010 currently at Committee stage will, when enacted, set out statutory procedures to be followed in dealing with applications for visas.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 156 of 24 June 2010, if he will confirm that visa officials are not qualified to carry out their own English tests by phone or interview; the reason the discretion for acceptance of a student on an educational course has been removed from education institutions and now rests solely with the deciding officer; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I can advise the Deputy that Visa Officers, in considering visa applications, do not carry out English language tests by telephone or face-to-face interview.  The question, therefore, of their proficiency to carry out English language tests does not arise.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that there are a number of accredited organisations involved in testing and providing certification in English language proficiency.  As mentioned in my response to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 156 and 157 of 24 June 2010, it is recommended that Study Visa applicants, regardless of nationality or educational background, undertake the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) English Language Test or a recognised equivalent.  Where English language proficiency is established by Study Visa applicants, they are advised to provide original certification of this with their visa application.  Along with a range of other investigations and checks, it is part of the routine investigative role of the Visa Officer to check into the validity of this certification.  As part of this wider investigative role, or for the purposes of clarification of aspects of the visa application, a Visa Officer may very occasionally conduct a face-to-face interview with any visa applicant (including a study visa applicant), or an interview over the telephone where the applicant is face-to-face with an <Col N="411"/>Honorary Consul.  Such contact with visa applicants is a routine part of the visa application process for most countries around the world.</P>
        <P>My Department has no role in selecting or recruiting students for programmes of study in Irish schools and colleges.  This is the task of the schools and colleges themselves, and is often done with the assistance of a local agent.  While evidence of acceptance on a course of study (from the educational provider) is a prerequisite in considering a Study Visa application, discretion rests, as has always been the case, with the Visa Officer as to whether a visa should be granted having regard to all relevant factors.</P>
        <P>Finally, my Department continually examines ways in which the visa process can facilitate the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s economic and other interests, while at the same time considering the needs of an effective immigration regime.  In this respect, as the Deputy will be aware, a document entitled &ldquo;New Immigration Regime For Full Time Non-EEA Students&rdquo; was launched by the Government on 22 September.  This was in tandem with the Government&rsquo;s five-year strategy document &ldquo;Investing in Global Relationships: Ireland&rsquo;s International Education Strategy 2010-15&rdquo;.  Copies of these documents are available from the websites of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the Department of Education and Skills respectively.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that my Department, in accordance with EU Directive 2000/84/EC, compiled and communicated submissions in respect of this issue to the European Commission from a number of relevant Departments and semi-state bodies in July 2007.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of the information made available to it from Member States, the European Commission reported that it took the view that the analysis set out in the proposal for the directive remained valid and that no member state had expressed a wish to abandon summer time or change the provisions of the current directive.  Accordingly, I can advise the Deputy that there are no plans to change the present summer time arrangements.</P>
        <P>I also wish to inform the Deputy that I have not had discussions with the British Government regarding proposals to change their time zone to central European time.</P>

        <Quest> if women in direct provision centres have been consulted directly to establish their views on whether women-only centres are warranted or desirable for they and their children&rsquo;s safety. </Quest>

	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision. The RIA currently operates 46 accommodation centres across the State. Of these 46 centres, 3 are for family accommodation only, 28 (such as Mosney) are a mix of family and single accommodation and 15 are for single persons only.</P>
        <P>In procuring and managing its accommodation, the RIA must take into consideration overall demand for accommodation and the changing profile of family groups. The RIA has always found that the accommodation of single women at family centres is the optimum for their accommodation needs. Experience has shown that family centres also allow for life events, such as newborn children, children reaching adulthood (both male and female) or the arrival into the State of spouses, partners and children (including adult children) to join a single or family unit, as well as relationships which break up. This minimises, to the greatest extent possible within the direct provision structure, the upheaval to residents over time. Single male centres do not experience this level of change as, normally, the movement would be of the single male towards a family unit where such life events arise.</P>
        <P>RIA is charged with providing the &lsquo;best accommodation fit&rsquo; for its residents having regard to the overall business needs and logistical and value for money challenges across its portfolio generally.  In that context, there is a limit to which individual preferences, whether established by direct consultation or otherwise, can be met.  Moreover, these preferences are subject to constant change. The RIA is mindful of the needs of men, women and children who require RIA assistance and this is reflected in the accommodation structure, security, health and safety arrangements, child protection, Garda vetting and parenting policies. In addition, the RIA <Col N="417"/>works with HSE services locally to facilitate access to public health nurses, GPs and other services on-site or in the community.</P>

	<P>Neither my Department nor the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have any function in relation to the regulation of legal transactions in jewellery and gold.  The informal purchase of jewellery and precious items is not specifically regulated in criminal legislation; however, the circumstances under which they are bought or sold may indicate the commission of certain offences.  For example, the handling of stolen property and or the possession of stolen property which are offences under Sections 17 and 18 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 respectively may be indicated through the specific circumstances under which transactions are effected.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enforce the provisions of the criminal law in respect of theft and robbery, including the theft and robbery of jewellery and gold. Garda management is aware that a number of outlets have been established in various areas that are buying gold for cash. A number of established jewellers are also buying gold and jewellery for cash.</P>
        <P>If members of the public have suspicions that goods being sold or traded may be stolen the correct action is for these suspicions to be referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The issue of whether the operation of the outlets in question contributes to the commission of offences is being kept under review.</P>

	<P>A Visiting Committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925 and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order, 1925.  The function of Visiting Committees is to visit at frequent <Col N="422"/>intervals the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner.  They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed.  The Visiting Committee members have free access either collectively or individually to every part of their prison. </P>
        <P>Members of the 14 Visiting Committees are appointed by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform for a term not exceeding three years.  A new expenses regime was brought into effect on 1 January, 2006.  This new system replaced a travel and subsistence expense type system and provides for a per diem payment at a current rate of &euro;142.50 per visit or meeting, which is subject to tax, and a vouched travel expenses allowance of up to &euro; 30 per visit / meeting.  The compilation of statistics relating to amounts paid to individual visiting committee members by way of travel and subsistence for each of the past four years would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort to prepare and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</P>
        <P>However, the following table sets out the total expenditure paid out to the Visiting Committees over each of the past six years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 and 289 together.</P>
        <P>Firstly, I would point out that the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is statutorily independent in the performance of its functions under the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended).  The Chairman of the Tribunal is obliged under the Act to ensure that the business of the Tribunal is managed efficiently and that the business assigned to members is disposed of expeditiously. Accordingly it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with or instruct the Tribunal in this regard.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Chairman that there is no policy of &ldquo;close scheduling&rdquo; in the Tribunal.  The Tribunal endeavours, in co-operation with Members, to manage the complex task of scheduling in the most efficient way possible.  It is difficult to forecast with accuracy the duration of hearings given the nature of the task, i.e. a hearing may take an unexpected direction and evidence given may be lengthier and more time consuming than anticipated.  Members of the Tribunal are given three weeks notice of their hearing schedule.  Where a Member advises that the time allocated for a hearing may be insufficient, the Tribunal will adjust the schedule accordingly.</P>
        <P>Records are not maintained in the Tribunal in relation to the information sought by the Deputy concerning late commencement of hearings.</P>

        <Quest> the additional cost to the taxpayer for a rescheduled hearing (details supplied) to include travelling expenses, subsistence allowance, attendance fee in respect of the applicant, his legal representative, witnesses and interpreter, for a new re-scheduled hearing; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that owing to the confidentiality provisions of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), it is not the practice to comment in any respect in relation to asylum applications which might be pending.  Details in relation to the overall costs to the taxpayer arising from the attendance of applicants at Tribunal hearings are not readily available as the costs involved are spread across various services including the Community Welfare Officer Service, the Refugee Legal Service, the Reception and Integration Agency and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal itself. </P>

	<P>Subsidiary Protection (SP) under the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 is a form of international protection offered to those persons who do not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee but who nonetheless claim a risk of serious harm in their country of origin if repatriated there.  Each application for Subsidiary Protection in the State is considered on the basis of its individual merits, having regard for the claims made by the applicant and measured against objective, reputable, up to date information relating to the applicant&rsquo;s country of origin.  </P>
        <P>A total of 6,356 applications for Subsidiary Protection have been made by failed asylum seekers between October 2006 and October 2010.  Grant decisions have been made in 34 cases and refusal decisions in 1,609 cases. 38 applications made in 2006 are outstanding as are 402 made in 2007, 623 made in 2008, 1,529 made in 2009 and 1,132 up to October in 2010.  I must point out that not all applications are eligible for consideration and other applications are not processed because the applicant has left the process for various reasons.</P>

In relation to Smallpox, the World Health Organisation certified the eradication of this disease in 1979.  This was endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 1980. </P>
        <P>As the gathering of information on the number of influenza cases throughout the prison estate would require accessing each individual prisoner&rsquo;s medical record, the gathering of such information would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The vast majority of the persons referred to are at large because of a technical breach, i.e., failing to sign on at the prison at an allotted time having been granted temporary release. I can advise the Deputy that the number of persons who have been granted temporary release from prison and were classified as unlawfully at large as of 26 October 2010 was 539.  A significant number are unlawfully at large for only a short period of time; in this context, it should be noted that of the above total, 71 prisoners returned within the following seventy two hours.</P>
        <P>The Garda&iacute; are informed where prisoners are unlawfully at large and have the power to detain, arrest and return such persons to prison.  I can also advise the Deputy that ongoing contact takes place between the Garda&iacute; and the Prison Service in relation to persons at large.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that the Minister may approve the temporary release of a sen<Col N="425"/>tenced prisoner.  This discretionary instrument assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release and in administering short sentences, and is an incentive to well-behaved prisoners.</P>
        <P>Temporary release arrangements operate similarly to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide. They are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender&rsquo;s Garda Station.  Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda&iacute;.</P>

	<P>On 6 October 2010, the European Union and the Republic of Korea signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in Brussels, immediately prior to the start of the fifth summit meeting between the two sides.  Earlier, in May, both sides had signed an EU-Korea Framework Agreement, which provides a broad platform for bilateral cooperation, including on global political and economic issues.</P>
        <P>The FTA itself is the most comprehensive free trade agreement ever negotiated by the EU.  It eliminates tariffs on nearly all industrial products within 3 years, as well as eliminating tariffs on agricultural products.  It will significantly liberalise trade in services, including telecommunications and financial services.  The FTA will also open new opportunities for EU exporters in the Korean public procurement market, where EU companies will be better able to compete against local enterprises.  Other issues of importance to exporters, such as trade facilitation (smoother customs procedures), clarity of regulation, dispute resolution and recognition of standards are also addressed in the FTA.</P>
        <P>The FTA opens opportunities for Irish exporters of goods and services.  Many of our top exports to South Korea will benefit from the liberalisation of trade provided for in the FTA.  The main products in this regard include pharmaceuticals, electronics, medical devices and spirits.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that Ireland will ratify both the FTA and the Framework Agreement in 2011 and that the necessary motions requesting D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to approve the terms and conditions of both Agreements will be submitted by the middle of next year.</P>
        <P>The FTA will provisionally enter into force on 1 July 2011.  Provisional application of the FTA will secure the principal benefits of the Agreement for European exporters at the initial stage pending the conclusion of internal ratification procedures by each EU Member State.  The FTA will enter into force definitively on the first day of the month following the date that confirmation has been received that the relevant ratification procedures have been completed in all 27 EU Member States.</P>
        <P>As required under the Lisbon Treaty, the Korea FTA has been referred to the European Parliament for its assent and I understand that the matter is currently being considered by the International Trade Committee (INTA).  The European Parliament and the Council are also required to approve safeguard measures accompanying the FTA which protect the EU against any possible surges in imports from Korea that could undermine EU producers.  Work is underway to get agreement between the Council and the European Parliament with a view to having the Safeguard Regulation adopted well in time for 1 July 2011.</P>

In mid 2009 a note was added to electronic publications indicating that rates for Lo-Call services may vary among different services providers.  A similar notice will be included in any new literature published.  All publications include both standard geographic and Lo-Call numbers.  </P>

        <Quest>  the position regarding plans aimed at drafting guidelines for retailers in labelling of goods from illegal Israeli settlements and his views on the reason Ireland has fallen behind other countries on this front which have already implemented such guidelines  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>While regulation of food labelling is not the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs, I share the view of the Deputy that many Irish consumers would wish to be aware if they were being asked to purchase produce originating in illegal Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories.     I therefore instructed my officials to initiate contacts on the matter with the responsible Government Departments.  I understand from these contacts that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Department of Health and Children have received no requests from retailers to produce advice or guidelines in this matter, and that there has been little pressure on the matter from consumers or the general public.  Accordingly, this is not regarded by them as a priority concern.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of guidelines having been issued in EU countries, other than in the UK, where the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) issued advice in December 2009 for retailers who wished to distinguish in food labelling between Palestinian produce from the West Bank and produce from Israeli settlements.</P>
        <P>The UK move came in response to pressure from consumers, charities and NGOs, and at the request of major retailers. It involved a two year process of consultation between concerned Departments and bodies, led by DEFRA, in which the Foreign and Commonwealth Office participated to advise on the political background. It consisted of simple and straightforward technical advice, suggesting how such labelling might be worded, for use by producers and retailers who wished to do so. It had no legal force, but was helpful to some UK retailers who wished to adopt more informative labelling, but felt more comfortable doing so in the context of Government advice.</P>
        <P>It is important to be clear that, just as in the UK, there is nothing to stop Irish retailers now, if they wish, from clearly labelling goods to distinguish settlement produce. They could do so along the same simple and obvious lines as in the DEFRA guidelines, as either &lsquo;Produce of the West Bank (Palestinian produce)&rsquo; or &lsquo;Produce of the West Bank (Israeli settlement)&rsquo;, or any similar wording.</P>

        <Quest>  his views on the situation of Saharawi citizens who, in protest at state activity, have established refugee camps and are under threat of intervention from the Moroccan army and police forces  </Quest>
        <QRef>[41255/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am deeply concerned about reports concerning the protest camp set up by Saharawi demonstrators on the outskirts of Laayoune in early October.  According to these reports, the Moroccan security forces entered the camp yesterday morning to disperse the protestors and the camp is now effectively closed.  At least two officials are reported to have been killed and an unconfirmed number of people injured in the incident.   It was notable that the demands of those who established the protest camp centred on equal rights and treatment for the Saharawi people, rather than the issues of sovereignty or the status of the territory.   I regret the death and violence which has occurred and the excessive reaction of the Moroccan security forces to what had been a peaceful protest on the part of Saharawi activists.  I call on all sides to act responsibly and ensure that this situation does not deteriorate further or impact negatively on the informal peace talks which were due to begin in New York. I would also call on both sides to cooperate fully in promoting practical confidence-building measures such as family reunion flights between Laayoune and the refugee camps in Tindouf which were regrettably suspended some weeks ago. </P>
        <P>Ireland continues to support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, as well as the continuing engagement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution in the territory based on the principle of self-determination. UN Secretary General Ban&rsquo;s Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, Christopher Ross, is continuing his efforts to bring about substantive negotiations on the future of the Western Sahara.</P>
        <P>Mr Ross has recently completed a tour of the region in an effort to resolve some of the issues preventing constructive engagement between Morocco and the Polisario. He is this week hosting a further round of informal discussions in New York. Previous rounds of informal talks were held in New York and Austria, most recently in February this year.  It is my hope that the two sides use this opportunity to engage in constructive dialogue: it is unfortunately clear that in the previous rounds of talks there has been no real engagement between the two sides on the substantive issues.  I regret that the start of the latest round of informal talks now appears to have been delayed due to yesterday&rsquo;s events in Laayoune.  The critical blockage remains Morocco&rsquo;s refusal to allow a referendum in the territory which would include an option of independence for the people of the Western Sahara. This has been provided for in a number of UN peace plans, and it is difficult to see that there can be any genuine self-determination without such a referendum.  Ireland will continue its dialogue with both Morocco and the Polisario, through their representatives based here in Ireland, to encourage support for the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s good offices mission and the efforts of Personal Envoy Ross to achieve some measure of political progress and increased confidence between both sides.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Department currently operates nine LoCall Numbers from its headquarters buildings dealing with customers on a national basis. These LoCall numbers were introduced to streamline telephone services and reduce the costs incurred by customers contacting these offices. The Department receives approximately half-a-million telephone calls per month across the network of Local Offices and headquarters buildings.  I am aware that customers calling 1890 (LoCall) numbers from mobile phones may incur additional changes and that tariffs may vary between service providers. Where Departmental LoCall numbers are advertised on the Department&rsquo;s website www.welfare.ie, or in Departmental literature, they are accompanied by a note explaining that rates charged for the use of 1890 numbers may vary among different service providers. An alternative, standard number is also provided which can be used by customers calling the Department from their mobile phones.  Where LoCall numbers are used in the Department&rsquo;s press advertisements alternative information sources and communication channels are listed such as email and SMS (text) services, the www.welfare.ie   website, and the network of Local and Branch Offices. Where the advertisement specifically concerns Local Office arrangements the relevant geographic phone number is provided.</P>

	<P>The Renewed Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce legal recognition of the acquired gender of transsexuals. The Gender Recognition Advisory Group was established in May 2010 with the following terms of reference:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;To advise the Minister for Social Protection on the legislation required to provide for legal recognition of the acquired gender of transsexuals. In particular to propose heads of a bill to provide for:</P>
        <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of a process for legal recognition of the acquired gender of persons suffering from Gender Identity Disorder who have made the transition from one gender to another</P>
        <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of a gender recognition register</P><Col N="434"/>
       <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The granting of entitlement to marry in the legally recognised reassigned gender, and</P>
       <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Any other provisions as may be deemed necessary consequent on the main provisions of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Group is made up of representatives of various Departments and Offices of State. The Group has met on a number of occasions and has engaged in extensive consultation with a range of representative organisations and individuals with knowledge and expertise in the area, both in Ireland and abroad. Further consultation, research and discussion is required on the issues arising. I understand that the Group hopes to report in December 2010.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are a number of steps to be taken before any legislation might come before the Oireachtas and it is not possible to be definitive as to timescales at this juncture. I would, however, assure the Deputy that the matter will be treated as a priority by my Department when the deliberations of the Gender Recognition Advisory Group are finalised.</P>

        <Quest> the number of persons currently waiting for appeals against decisions of social welfare officers; the average length of time an appeal takes to be processed; the extra resources that have been allocated to the appeals office to deal with the increased workload; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, as of 31st October 2010, there were 20,959 cases being processed through various stages of the appeals system. Overall, the average time taken to process a summary decision was 28 weeks, while the average time to process an oral hearing was 44.5 weeks.  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.</P>
        <P>A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. During 2009, 59% of all appeal cases were dealt with by way of oral hearing but, due to some of the initiatives outlined below, this has been reduced to 31% in 2010 to date.  In order to be fair to all appellants, the vetting of appeals and the arranging of oral hearings are dealt with in chronological order.</P><Col N="435"/>
        <P>Since January 2009, 3 additional Appeals Officers have been assigned to the Office, as well as 4 additional staff to the administration area.  In addition, it was decided to use experienced retired Appeals Officers strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and eight of these officers have been operating on a part-time basis since July.</P>
        <P>In addition to the provision of more staff, more emphasis is now being placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis so as to increase productivity, a project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented and significant enhancements have been made to the office&rsquo;s IT and phone systems.</P>
        <P>As a result of all of these initiatives, a total of 22,995 appeals have been finalised until the end of October in comparison to 14,278 in the same period in 2009.  I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide a copy of the agreement between his Department and Dublin Bus regarding the funding provided to the company under the free travel scheme; the way the funding is determined and the basis on which the amount is altered each year; how often the contract or agreement is reviewed; the way free pass usage is surveyed and accounted for; the extent of route analysis that is carried out to determine if services are actually provided to areas where there is a significant concentration of older persons and other free travel claimants; his plans, if any, to review the amount of remuneration paid to Dublin Bus in view of the significant deterioration of services to poorer areas and areas with an older population profile as proposed in its current reorganisation of services on the north side of Dublin.</Quest>

	<P>The free travel scheme is a long standing arrangement in place since 1967 following extensive discussions at the time with CI&Eacute;.  Payment was agreed on the basis of fares foregone.  Over the years there were negotiations to increase the benefit and value of the scheme including the agreement of relevant discounts.  The current rate of payment is reviewed annually and adjusted on the basis of changes in rates of fares and numbers of eligible customers.  However, the level of service provided by Dublin Bus does not feature in the current method of calculation of payment.</P>
        <P>My Department pays the CI&Eacute; Group centrally in respect of transport services provided by the Group for pensioners and other categories of eligible customers under the free travel scheme.  The apportionment of payment between the three constituent companies, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is a matter for the CI&Eacute; Group to determine.</P>
        <P>Route analysis and provision of transport services is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport.</P>
        <P>My Department is working towards the replacement of the current paper based free travel pass with a public services card during 2011.  It has been agreed that the public services card for customers in receipt of the free travel scheme will incorporate a contactless integrated ticketing chip for travel entitlement on services which have been enabled with smart card reading devices.  In conjunction with the roll out of integrated ticketing, the use of this technology will facilitate the provision of more accurate usage data.</P>

	<P>The habitual residence condition was introduced in order to ensure that a person, who has had no attachment to the work force since arrival in Ireland and whose habitual residence is elsewhere, would not be entitled to payment under certain exchequer-funded schemes on arrival in Ireland. </P>
        <P>Decisions concerning habitual residence are subject to five factors which have been laid down by the European Court of Justice, and which are now incorporated into our domestic social welfare legislation.  The five factors are:</P>
        <P el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</P>
         <P el="5">(b) <?oasys _ix ?>the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</P>

        <P el="5">(e) <?oasys _ix ?>the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There is currently no discrimination on grounds of nationality in social welfare legislation and to introduce such a provision would be contrary to the equality principles that Ireland has adopted in our own equality legislation, and that we are obliged to respect by virtue of other international conventions.</P>
        <P>Irish nationals returning to live here on a permanent basis should experience no difficulty in demonstrating that they satisfy the requirements of the Habitual Residence Condition.</P>

	<P>EU Migrant workers may have an entitlement to child benefit and other &ldquo;family benefits&rdquo; under EU Regulations 883/04 and 987/09. Where a national of an EU state is working in Ireland, he/she is entitled to payment of these benefits when his/her children are resident in the worker&rsquo;s home country. The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work. </P>
        <P>Child Benefit is currently in payment to a total of 4,975 customers in respect of 7,965 children resident in seventeen EU countries. A breakdown of these customers by country is not readily available. The estimated total cost for 2010 is &euro;14.3million, which represents less than 1% of the total Child Benefit expenditure. This equates to approximately &euro;1.2 million per month.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 22 June 2010. It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  These papers were received back in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 27 October 2010 and the appeal will be referred in due course to an Appeals Officer who will decide whether the case can be decided on a summary basis or whether to list it for oral hearing.</P>
        <P>There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There was an increase of a further 44% in the number of appeals received in the first eight months of 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals.  In order to be fair to all appellants, oral hearings are arranged in strict chronological order.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives have been put in place to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />3 additional Appeals Officers have been assigned to that Office since January 2009,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A number of additional staff were assigned to the administration area of the Office,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The organisation of the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s work has been changed so as to increase productivity,</P><Col N="440"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented, and</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is paid to people living in private rented accommodation who cannot provide for the cost of their accommodation from their own resources.   One of the conditions to qualify for rent supplement is that a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons or an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement. A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by the relevant local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.</P>
        <P>In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the local housing authority in the area where claim to rent supplement is made (and the person intends to reside).  Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement.</P>
        <P>The other conditions for the scheme include a habitual residence test and a means test. The person in question should contact their local community welfare officer who will offer advice in relation to specific entitlements.</P>

	<P>A high-level coordinating group, chaired by my Department, is identifying opportunities that may arise for Ireland, across the sports, tourism and cultural sectors, from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  The group comprises representatives from F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Arts Council, Culture Ireland, the Irish Sports Council, the Olympic Council of Ireland, Paralympic Council of Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  </P>
        <P>The discussions of the group are taking into account the current economic situation and the findings of the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics Task Force Report which was published last year.  The Task Force report made a number of recommendations arising from an audit carried out of high quality sports facilities in Ireland and the findings of a report by Indecon International Economic Consultants on the economic evaluation of the benefit to the island of Ireland of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.</P>
        <P>Given our proximity to London and the many accessible routes to and from the United Kingdom, we can benefit from a sporting, tourism and culture perspective.  The hosting in Ireland of Olympic and Paralympic teams for training purposes leading up to the Games has potential, while the economic benefits of securing additional tourists to Ireland before, during and after the Games are significant.</P>
        <P>In terms of the tourism potential of the event, a number of specific initiatives are being undertaken by the Tourism Agencies to seek to maximise the potential benefits to Irish tourism of having the Olympics in London. These measures include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Working with the official tour operators responsible for co-ordinating the travel arrangements for athletes participating in the Games to ensure that Ireland is included as a destination for pre and post-Olympics packages.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Arranging pre and post-Olympics familiarisation visits for key media contacts who are attending the London Olympics. These visits will showcase the sports facilities and cultural product on offer throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Targeting tourists from London who may wish to get away from the city when the games are in progress, by offering good value offers and packages linked to other events in Ireland and presenting Ireland as a place to escape to and relax.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Since there will be reduced accommodation and carrier capacity available for visitors who wish to travel to London when the Olympics are on, Tourism Ireland will also be working with UK inbound tour operators to offer alternatives which would fill any gaps in their normal programmes, thereby diverting business to Ireland.</P><Col N="443"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland supported University College Dublin in their launch as a potential Olympic Training camp venue and also supported the European Triathlon Championships this year in Athlone.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These are some of the practical areas of work that are underway. Given the many factors which may have an impact and are as yet uncertain, it is  too early to set specific targets for visitor numbers or associated revenue arising from the Olympics at this stage.  The High-Level Coordinating Group will continue to meet on an ongoing basis to maximise opportunities from the London 2012 Games and obviously this will influence the benefits to Ireland. The outcome of this work will be reflected in the visitor number and revenue targets contained in Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s 2012 Business Plan which will be prepared next year.</P>

Under section 2 of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952, if a vehicle is used in a condition or manner which would attract motor tax at a higher rate, tax then becomes payable at that rate.  In other words, if a goods vehicle is used in a private capacity, it must, like all other private vehicles, be taxed at the private rate of motor tax.

	<P>In keeping with international best practice, Ireland follows a generic approach to emergency management, which includes provision for severe weather emergencies.  This is set out in A Framework for Major Emergency Management, which was approved by Government in May 2006 and details the processes and procedures for managing and co-ordinating preparedness for, and response to, Major Emergencies. </P>
        <P>Each principal response agency (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na divisions, Health Service Executive areas and the main local authorities) has adopted new format Major Emergency Plans with effect from 30 September 2008, based on a common emergency plan template outlined in the Framework.</P>
        <P>A National Steering Group, chaired and supported by my Department, and involving the Departments of Justice and Law Reform, Health and Children, Defence and Transport, as well as the principal response agencies and Defence Forces as members, oversaw the roll-out and cut-over to the Framework&rsquo;s arrangements, in accordance with a Government approved &ldquo;Major Emergency Development Programme&rdquo; that ran from 2006 until 2008. During this development programme key personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE and the local authorities were trained for their emergency management roles.  Each agency has a number of people authorised and trained in the process of declaring a Major Emergency.</P>
        <P>On specific severe weather preparedness, the Framework requires each local authority to have a specific sub-plan for responding to severe weather events.  The Severe Weather Plan can be activated to co-ordinate the response whether a major emergency is declared or not. During the two severe weather events of last winter, for example, the coordination and inter-<Col N="445"/>agency arrangements set out in the Framework were implemented at local and regional level, as required by local circumstances, without the declaration of a major emergency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Local authorities are provided with information from a number of systems including the Public Service Weather Warnings from Met &Eacute;ireann, the IceCast Road Weather Information System (RWIS) operated by the National Road Authority in conjunction with Met &Eacute;ireann, and river and coastal flood warning systems where these are in place.  I am aware that OPW is further developing flood forecasting and warning systems.  The Framework sets out guidance on contact with the media and providing information to the public.</P>

	<P>When coal is burned, it produces a range of pollutants injurious to human health and the environment including sulphur dioxide which relates to the sulphur content of the fuel burned. This pollutant can cause deterioration in ambient air quality standards, particularly in cities and towns, and contributes to the acidification of ecosystems.</P>
        <P>In order to improve air quality, the sulphur content of bituminous coal is currently limited to 0.7 % by a Voluntary Agreement with members of the Solid Fuel Trade Group (SFTG). This agreement has been in place since 2002 and has helped to protect air quality standards in areas where bituminous coal continues to be used.</P>
        <P>My Department, in consultation with representatives of the SFTG and other stakeholders, is now giving consideration to further strengthening measures to improve ambient air and the protection of human health and environmental quality from the pollutants caused by the burning of solid fuel. In this context, the establishment of a statutory basis for the 0.7% maximum sulphur content standard is under consideration.  This work is being carried out in the context of the forthcoming application of the carbon tax to solid fuel in the domestic sector.</P>

	<P>My Department operates an 1890 telephone number which provides access to its main offices, as well as standard geographic telephone numbers for all offices.  </P>
        <P>My Department is aware that differences apply to the cost of the Lo-Call designated telephone numbers depending on a caller&rsquo;s service provider.  It has been working with the Quality Customer Service Officers Network convened by the Transforming Public Services Programme Office in the Department of the Taoiseach to determine the best approach to ensure members of the public are aware that variations in charges apply so that they may avail of the lowest <Col N="446"/>cost call rates.   Arising from these discussions, my Department has already taken action to ensure that where the Department&rsquo;s 1890 telephone number is advertised on its main website <i>www.environ.ie </i> , and on a number of other departmental websites, customers are informed that the rates charged for calling 1890 numbers may vary among different service providers. Customers are advised to check with their telephone provider to determine whether or not they can avail of low rates on Lo-Call numbers. The Department&rsquo;s alternative geographic landline telephone numbers are also available to customers in these circumstances.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently reviewing arrangements to ensure that information is included in all literature and publications providing contact details for the Department (including telephone directories) and on any other websites where the Department&rsquo;s Lo-Call number is advertised, and to ensure that a standard geographic landline telephone number is provided in such instances.</P>

	<P>In April 2009 my Department commenced a review of the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, under which the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) operates. The purpose of this review was to consider whether the Act best supported the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions and whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.  A public consultation process was carried out between 29 May 2009 and 10 July 2009.</P>
        <P>Arising out of this, I announced the preliminary outcomes of the review in November 2009; they include recommendations in a number of key areas, and have an overall emphasis on streamlining and simplifying the Act and reducing delays.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that the General Scheme of the Bill setting out the detailed proposals arising in the context of the review will be submitted to Government before the end of this year.  Publication of the Bill thereafter will depend on the time subsequently required for drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>

        <P>Postal voting is provided for in electoral law in respect of certain categories of person who are entered in the register of electors.  The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by whole-time members of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses.  Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996); electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day and full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State &mdash; in these cases, the law provides for completion of the necessary voting documentation at a Garda station (the Electoral Act 1997); certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001); and electors who because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006).</P>
        <P>While electoral law is subject to ongoing review I have no proposals at present to alter existing arrangements for postal voting.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 355, 356, 362, 367 and 378 together. </P>
        <P>I plan to publish legislation to transpose the Third Postal Services Directive shortly.  The Directive provides for the final step in the gradual and controlled opening of the postal services market to competition and ensuring the continuing provision of a universal postal service.  The issues for Ireland arising from its implementation have been widely and comprehensively consulted upon, and as with all legislative proposals, a regulatory impact analysis was conducted.</P>
        <P>In designing the new regulatory framework, the key principles are the maintenance of a universal postal service and the development of a competitive sector providing competitively priced, high quality postal services to both business and residential customers.</P>
        <P>I will be submitting the text of the enabling legislation to Government very shortly and will publish it immediately after Government approval.  It would not be appropriate to set out specific provisions in the Bill which relate to issues raised in these Questions in advance of Government approval and publication of the Bill Irrespective of liberalisation, An Post and the postal sector as a whole face challenges, not least the adverse impact   on revenues from electronic substitution.  An Post will therefore need to continue to cut costs and seek to innovate and generate new income streams if it is to compete effectively and be the operator of choice in a liberalised market.  These issues are clearly the responsibility of the Board and management of the company.</P>
        <P>Similarly, staff issues are the responsibility of the management of all postal service providers and general employment legislation applies across the economy as a whole.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises the important role that An Post has played to date and it is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and maintain a nationwide, customer focussed network of post offices.  An innovative, successful An Post will play a key role in the development of the wider postal sector.  To achieve this the management and workforce of An Post must meet the challenges arising from liberalisation, and more generally, as set out above.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the debate on the draft legislation when it is published, and will be working towards having it enacted before the end of the year.</P>

        <P>In accordance with this provision, RTE&rsquo;s Annual Report and Group Financial Statements, 2009, was submitted to me earlier this year, incorporating the required statement on Page 70.

        <P>With regard to my powers and responsibilities under the Act, the above reporting and operational requirements are supplemented by ex-ante and ex-post Ministerial and regulatory oversight mechanisms to be used when and as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Section 109(6) of the Act, for example, provides that the Minister may require a public service broadcast corporation to provide him with such information as he deems necessary in respect of any balance sheet, account or report or in relation to the policy and operations of the corporation other than day-to-day operations.</P>
        <P>In accordance with this provision, my Department is currently engaging with RTE in regard to the policies, processes and mechanisms that are in place to support the corporation&rsquo;s compliance with the Act&rsquo;s provisions regarding transparency and arm&rsquo;s length operation.  This engagement falls within my Department&rsquo;s standard practice in delivering on its corporate governance functions with regard to the State bodies under its aegis.</P>
        <P>In addition, as referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions, the Broadcasting Act 2009 also provides for a possible role to be given to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and its Compliance Committee in this area.  In particular, section 108(3) provides that the Minister may direct the Compliance Committee of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to report on compliance by a corporation with its arm&rsquo;s length obligations; and section 109(11) provides that <Col N="452"/>the Minister may direct the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to publish guidelines for a corporation in relation to its activities and statement as set out above.</P>
        <P>These sections would only be invoked in circumstances where I am not satisfied with the level of transparency or any element of RTE&rsquo;s operation of its commercial activities at arm&rsquo;s length.  I will keep this matter under review.</P>

        <Quest> when Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will submit an up to date review of electricity and gas prices here as the latest edition dates back to May 2010 before the recent increase in prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[41129/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) will publish its update of electricity and gas prices in early December. Updated prices data for Ireland have been submitted to Eurostat, which will publish the complete set of comparative European data next month.  Recent adjustments to the PSO will be reflected in the May 2011 publication &mdash; data collection for that period under the relevant EU Directive commences in the new year.</P>
        <P>Recognising the concerns of indigenous business and the inward investment community, particularly in view of the difficult economic conditions, the Government has put in place a number of measures to mitigate the cost of energy for business.</P>
        <P>All electricity users benefitted in 2009 from rebates totalling &euro;567m.  In July 2009 the Government agreed that these rebates would continue for large energy users at the same level until October 2010 and would then be phased out over the following two year period.</P><Col N="453"/>
        <P>The Carbon Revenue Levy commenced on July 1st 2010, following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy) Act.  This Act levies electricity generators to capture a significant portion of the carbon windfall gains that they are currently receiving.  Receipts from the Carbon Revenue Levy will fund the large energy user rebate until the end of 2012.</P>
        <P>For small to medium business users, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) reduced regulated ESB prices twice in 2009, by an average of 10% from May 1st and a further 5.5% from October 1st 2009.</P>
        <P>Business customers can also avail of the competitive benefits of value and choice by shopping around for alternative suppliers.  Competition in the business electricity market has developed to such an extent that the CER has recently decided to end price regulation for ESB in this market segment.  As a result, ESB is free to compete against the independent electricity suppliers for all business customers.</P>
        <P>The CER had also completed its 5-year review of electricity network expenditure.  The review imposes measures to ensure that ESB and EirGrid make even greater efficiencies in network operational and capital expenditure, thus mitigating costs for all consumers.  In line with Government policy, this review also includes some re-balancing of network tariffs in the interests of mitigating energy costs for business.</P>
        <P>Taken together, these measures, along with falling natural gas prices, have already had a significant impact on Ireland&rsquo;s energy cost competitiveness over the last two years.  The latest comparative statistics available from the SEAI show that in general, Irish electricity prices in 2009 fell at a faster rate than in the rest of the EU, moving Ireland significantly closer to the EU average.  Prices for the majority of business consumption bands are within 6% of the EU average. The SEAI data for the first half of 2010 show further significant reductions in Irish electricity prices. Prices for the large business categories have reduced on a cumulative basis by some 34%-44% in the 18 months to June 2010.</P>
        <P>The Government also remains firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on electricity prices.  Significant progress has been made to date, most notably with the all-island Single Electricity Market now in its 3rd year of successful operation, the sale of ESB generation capacity, the entry of new players into both the generation and supply markets and new generation capacity coming on-stream in the Irish market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter for private sector service providers operating in a liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  Service providers&rsquo; decisions to provide broadband services in areas are taken on the basis of commercial viability. Such decisions are matters for the service providers concerned.</P>
        <P>In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.</P>
        <P>EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</P>
        <P>The mapping exercise undertaken by my Department at the time of designing the NBS found that a number of broadband suppliers were already active in the area referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question and consequently the locality was excluded from the Scheme.</P>
        <P>It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am <Col N="455"/>aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend to shortly launch a Rural Broadband Scheme.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched. ComReg&rsquo;s website <i>www.callcosts.ie</i> provides detailed information on the various private sector telecommunications products and services available on a county by county basis including County Clare.</P>

        <P>The context for this statement was clearly the cost of onshore wind to the Public Service Obligation (PSO) which was the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question.

	<P>The provisions in relation to the submission of the Authority&rsquo;s three-year estimates and expenditure proposals and their publication are set out in section 37 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.</P>
        <P>In relation to the estimates for the period 2011-2013, I can confirm that these estimates were submitted to my Department by the Authority on 29th October 2010.  My Department is now engaging with the Authority in relation to the provision of certain further information in accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009.</P>
        <P>In relation to publication, the legislation requires that, subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, the Authority shall publish its 3-year estimates or a summary of them on a website maintained by the Authority.  I am very much aware that both public and commercial broadcasters will be keen to view the Authority&rsquo;s expenditure proposals as early as possible and it is my intention to facilitate this as much as practicable.</P>

	<P>Preparation of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill, which gives effect to commitments in the Programme for Government and the Renewed Programme for Government on issues relating to animal health and welfare, is ongoing in my Department. The new bill will consolidate and update a wide range of existing legislation to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals, is properly protected and that the penalties for offenders are increased significantly. The consolidation of legislation into a single statute should prove considerably more convenient to all those who deal with or have an interest in animal health and welfare matters.</P>

	<P>An application under the 2010 Single Payment Scheme//Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 14 April 2010, a number of parcels listed on which required digitising. This process was recently completed which allowed the 50% advance of the Single Payment and the full payment under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme issue to the person named within recent days.</P>
        <P>The EU Regulations governing REPS 4 and other area-based schemes provide that payments issue in two instalments. The first instalment of 75% may be paid once all administrative checks on all applications, as well as cross-checks against areas declared on Single Payment Scheme applications, have been completed.  This process is under way and while my objective is to make all payments for 2010 as soon as possible, the checks are likely to take some weeks to complete. The balancing payment of 25% can issue once all on-the-spot inspections for the year have taken place.  The programme of inspections is well advanced at this stage.</P>

	<P>The terms of the FEPS scheme states that an applicant for a FEPS premium, must, at the time of application for the FEPS premium each year, also be in REPS. Unfortunately, these applicants&rsquo; REPS membership ceased before the end of their 5-year FEPS term, making them ineligible to receive further FEPS payments after 2009. On this basis, as the terms of the scheme are explicit, unfortunately the applicants cannot be re-admitted to the FEPS scheme.</P>

	<P>Both the Beef and Sheepmeat Fund and the Dairy Investment Fund are financed by the Exchequer. No EU funding is involved.  The Funds were announced by my Department and promoted by Enterprise Ireland through engagement with the respective industries.  Applications for both funds were carefully considered and all eligible projects were assessed and evaluated according to strict commercial and technical criteria by an expert committee comprising members from my Department, Enterprise Ireland, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Bord Bia, industry and academic experts.   Beef &amp; Sheepmeat Fund:  The purpose of the Fund is to stimulate the necessary investment in the sector to ensure the long-term competitiveness of the industry in Ireland.  In all 15 capital investment projects were awarded grant aid of &euro;69 million to contribute to investment of some &euro;178 million with a view to increasing net sales and exports by &euro;400 million.   Dairy Fund:  The primary purpose of the Dairy Investment Fund is to increase the efficiency of the main dairy outputs by supporting the upgrading of existing plant and <Col N="465"/>buildings to capture new business and to develop value added products. Grant-aid of &euro;114 million was awarded for 19 projects to contribute to investment of &euro;268 million. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food </TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The original Government decision on the decentralisation of my Department was that 600 headquarter posts would move to Portlaoise; some 100 posts in the local offices in Cork city would move to Fermoy; and up to 100 posts in the laboratories in Cork and Limerick would move to Macroom.  The Government announced, in 2008, that the moves of my Department&rsquo;s offices to Fermoy and Macroom had been deferred pending a review in 2011.  The Fisheries function was transferred to my Department in 2007 and the administrative staff of the fisheries area, comprising some 85 posts, were decentralised to Clonakilty.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s original Decentralisation Implementation Plan allowed for a phased move to Portlaoise, so as to aid continuity of business and maintenance of service delivery to stakeholders.  Since the programme began there has been an increase in Portlaoise of some 300 posts bringing the total there to almost 500 posts.  The purchase of a site for the Department&rsquo;s offices in Portlaoise was completed in 2007 and the OPW subsequently announced a preferred tender as part of a PPP (including other Government offices in Mullingar and Carlow).  In the context of the last budget, the Minister for Finance decided that the PPP would not go ahead but that the Department&rsquo;s building in Portlaoise would proceed &lsquo;on a traditional procurement basis&rsquo; and this is now being considered by the OPW.</P>

	<P>The Renewed Programme for Government commits, subject to resources, to increase annual forestry planting to 10,000 hectares per annum.  Some progress towards that objective has been made with funding provided this year for over 7,000 hectares of new planting.  The Deputy will be aware that all aspects of public expenditure are being subject to in depth critical scrutiny and forestry is no different in this regard.  I am very much aware of the concern expressed by farming and industry sources about the adequacy of the capital allocation of &euro;89 million for the forestry programme in the recently published Capital Review &mdash; Infrastructure Investment Priorities 2010-2106.  While this amount is indicative only, it will, nevertheless, inform the Estimates process.  As part of that process, the Department is reviewing its available capital resources to ensure that priority needs and commitments are met.  The Government remains committed to ensuring the continuation of the afforestation programme at a rate and in a format that maximises the use of scarce financial resources. </P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation</P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim on 5 July 2010 in respect of the above individual.  This claim awaits processing.</P>
        <P>In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the current processing time for these claims has improved and claims dating from April 2010 are currently being processed.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Almost doubling the number of staff   working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget  towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  In 2009, my Department processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on the previous year.  Furthermore, the level of new claims processed in the first ten months of 2010 was 63,484 &mdash; up over 66 % on the corresponding 10-month period in 2009 (38,149) and surpassing the total amount of claims processed for the full year 2009 which came to 50,644.  The backlog of claims is decreasing &mdash; reducing from its highest level in November 2009 of 43,608 to a current level of 28,300.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  </P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that on the basis of valid claims entered in the Redundancy Payments System in my Department, there is no record of a redundancy claim having been received in respect of the individual in question.</P>
        <P>It is my Department&rsquo;s practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.  Forms are returned to allow missing details and/or supporting documentation to be submitted.  Submission of correctly completed Redundancy claim forms (RP50&rsquo;s) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims.</P>
        <P>Under Redundancy legislation the onus, in the first instance, is on the employer to pay to the employee their redundancy entitlements.  The employer is then entitled, by virtue of pay related social contributions to the Social Insurance Fund, to recover 60% of the amount paid to the employee.</P>
        <P>In circumstances where the employer is unable to pay the redundancy entitlements, a claim can be lodged with the Department and the documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer&rsquo;s inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company&rsquo;s Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.</P>
        <P>If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee&rsquo;s right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.</P>

In the course of processing the claim, my Department has been unable to contact the former employer or her representative to request evidence of inability to pay.

        <P>In the interim period, until the legislation is enacted, the opportunity is being taken to explore with stakeholders the possibilities of agreeing a Voluntary Code.  To this end I appointed John Travers to facilitate discussions with stakeholders in relation to the drawing up of a Voluntary Code.  Mr. Travers is currently engaging with the relevant stakeholders in relation to the development of a Voluntary Code.  Mr. Travers will report to me on his efforts to facilitate agreement on the terms of a Voluntary Code in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises the importance of ensuring that there is a fair balance in the relationships between the various players in the grocery goods sector, particularly given the importance of this sector to the national economy.  The introduction of a Code, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders including the interests of the consumer and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing-on of lower prices to consumers.</P>

	<P>The first meeting of the new Trade Council took place on 27 October last, as outlined in a reply by the Minister for Trade and Commerce to Parliamentary Question 40327 last week.  The relevant Departments and State Agencies have, accordingly, commenced work on the implementation of the various actions set out in Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy including that in relation to developing toolkits for Irish businesses trying to enter new markets.</P>
        <P>Departments and agencies are currently engaged in building on the range of in-market supports already available to small businesses, to prepare country-specific intelligence on the identified priority markets, along with a simple tool for evaluating &lsquo;export preparedness&rsquo;.  When <Col N="481"/>finalised, these exporter toolkits &mdash; consisting of printed materials, supplemented by online resources and personal contact &mdash; will be available to all interested small businesses.</P>
        <P>Much of this material already exists, for example Enterprise Ireland already has a wide range of relevant documentation available for interested companies.  What is envisaged is the provision of a more comprehensive &lsquo;toolkit&rsquo;, which will gather together all relevant information and advice and bring it together in a more accessible and useful format.</P>
        <P>In addition to the toolkits being available from Agency Headquarters and local offices, the Department of Foreign Affairs will put in place arrangements to ensure that the toolkits will also be available through the network of Embassies and Consulates.</P>

	<P>The Defence Acts 1954-2007 provide for the calling out of reservists on &ldquo;Permanent Service&rdquo; or in &ldquo;Aid to the Civil Power&rdquo;.  The RDF has not been called out in either capacity in the recent past.     Whilst, the Defence Acts 1954-2007 <Col N="484"/>provide for contingents of the PDF serving on overseas peace support missions, there is no provision in the Act for the deployment of the Reserve Defence Force on peace support missions overseas. The Department had been in the process of making Regulatory provision to allow suitably qualified members of the RDF serve in the PDF for the express purpose of this overseas service. However, plans to send members of the Reserve overseas were subsequently suspended and there are no plans to do so for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>Defence Forces Regulation R5 provides for members of the RDF, with their own consent, being employed on duties in &lsquo;Aid to the Civil Authority&rdquo; (ATCA) with the approval of the General Officer Commanding a Brigade or the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service, at such times and at such places as the Officer Commanding the Brigade RDF or Officer Commanding Shore Operations Naval Service may determine. The most recent time that Reservists took part in an ATCA type operation was in a search for a missing boy around Midleton, Co. Cork in January 2005, when 86 members of the 34 Reserve Infantry Battalion assisted.</P>
        <P>In recent times, the Defence Forces have met operational requirements from within the capacity and resources of the Permanent Defence Force without the need to call up the Reserve Defence Force. Consequently the primary focus of the Reserve has been on training and preparation. In addition, members of the Reserve participate in major ceremonial events and provide a range of community supports at local level.</P>

	<P>The primary role of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) in peacetime is to train for contingency tasks.  Training is delivered at unit level, at affiliated unit level, at Brigade Training Centre level and at the Defence Forces Training Centre.   The Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan has provided the framework for the development of the Reserve over recent years. The Plan outlined a series of steps that were designed to significantly enhance the quality of training within the Reserve Defence Force. A revised training strategy supported by new syllabi and which includes training delivery through distance learning and the affiliation of RDF units with Permanent Defence Force (PDF) units is in place.  An individual training logbook is issued to all trainees to record progress in acquiring skills.</P>
        <P>Instructors, both PDF and RDF, are suitably qualified in accordance with the formal syllabi of training.  This procedure is in place to ensure uniformity in the standard of training throughout the formations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 437 to 439, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>In the context of the Government decision on the implementation of savings measures on public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, all recruitment to the RDF was suspended in March 2009.  Following a subsequent review and examination of RDF personnel numbers and budgets for 2009, limited recruitment to fill vacancies arising due to existing Reserve members resigning, or being discharged in the normal manner resumed.</P>
        <P>This limited recruitment is continuing subject to the overall strength level that existed at 1 January 2009 (7,671) not being exceeded.  The limited recruitment will also be monitored and kept under review in the light of the uptake of paid training within the RDF and the future budgetary provision available to the Department.</P>
        <P>I am aware that numbers in the Reserve have declined over recent years.  This trend in reduced volunteerism is not confined to the Reserve but is indicative of broader societal trends.  It should also be noted that a more rigorous approach is now taken to removing the names of non-effective personnel from unit rolls.  This accounts for part of the fall in numbers over recent years.</P>
        <P>There is now a requirement to examine the progress that has been made and to chart the future direction of the Reserve.  Work has commenced on a Value for Money Review of the Reserve which is being overseen by a Steering Committee comprising representatives from the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the Department of Finance.  The Steering Group are working towards a target date for completion of end March 2011.  The findings of this Review will help inform the future plans for the Reserve.</P>
        <P>The detailed information requested by the Deputy regarding the recruitment situation since September 2009 to date is not readily available and is being compiled at present.  This information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>
