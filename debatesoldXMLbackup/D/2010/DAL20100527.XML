      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32.  I will call Deputies in the order in which they submitted notices to my office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the urgent need to support the poorest and most disadvantaged communities and groups in Ireland; to call on the Government to support Voices that Matter, a grouping of national organisations that represent, empower and respond to the needs of groups experiencing poverty, exclusion and inequality; and finally to call on the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to ensure any future funding programme prioritises a focus on combating poverty and inequality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Government to take seriously the issue of pyrite, which is present in up to 20,000 houses in the State, and to provide the necessary funding immediately to help those householders whose homes are starting to collapse around them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss a matter of national importance, namely, the continued embargo on recruitment in the HSE which is putting people's lives at risk and which is especially impacting on the care of our elderly, particularly in the Plunkett Home in Boyle, County Roscommon, where the Government still has not lived up its commitment to employ a clinical nurse manager.</P>

	<P>It is proposed to take No. <i>a</i>11, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting victims, repealing <Col N="604"/>Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA; No. <i>b</i>11, motion re membership of committees; No. 22, Adoption Bill 2009 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Order for Report, Report and Final Stages, to adjourn at 1.30 p.m., if not previously concluded, and the order shall not resume thereafter; and No. 23, Nurses and Midwives Bill 2010  &mdash; Second Stage (resumed).  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. <i>a</i>11 and <i>b</i>11 shall be decided without debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>

	<P>The letter worked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to raise a number of matters.  It transpires that the HSE is confused about the request the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, made of it.  We were told it was impossible to find out the number of children who may have died in the care of the State over the past decade but now we have been informed the figure will be available in the next two days.  What has happened to ensure this information will be available in the next two days as it should have been in the first place, given the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children, who seems to have washed her hands of this matter entirely, and the Minister of State were unable to confirm the figure?</P>
        <P>Second, what progress has been made in regard to having the Attorney General approve the wording agreed by the all-party Oireachtas committee in respect of a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights?  Today&rsquo;s Amnesty International report joins in the request that this matter be dealt with as quickly as possible.  I respect the fact that we have to get the wording right.  What progress has the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, made in giving his proposal to the Attorney General for confirmation to the Government in order that we can have the referendum?</P>
        <P>Third, the Government voted down a Fine Gael proposal last December to extend the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General to deal with the audit of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, which was supported by other parties in the House.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is now of the opinion that this should be so.  Will that be done by regulation based on what he said yesterday or will it require primary legislation?  If so, when will it come before the House?</P>
        <P>As Deputy Terence Flanagan has pointed out on a number of occasions in his role as spokesperson on housing, the number of people in mortgage arrears is increasing by 4,000 a month.  What is the Government&rsquo;s response in terms of a policy decision to deal with this serious matter for an increasing number of people?  The current figure is 36,000 but it may go as high as 300,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>First, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and senior HSE executives met yesterday afternoon to follow up on the issues of concern raised by the Government.  In March this year, the Minister of State wrote to the chairman of the HSE asking for the information required to be made available to him in April.  He did not receive correspondence until May and, following on from that, he took the action he did in the context of ensuring information is made available.  When the Minister of State raised this issue with the HSE regarding the forthcoming correspondence, there was absolutely no view that there was any confusion or issues raised by the HSE at that <Col N="605"/>time.  Following the meeting with the Taoiseach yesterday and the senior executives, the HSE is responding to the request for information.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach, on everyone&rsquo;s behalf, expressed the absolute importance and urgency of the matter.  That information will be made available and on that basis there is no confusion about what is being requested under the HIQA guidelines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The confusion is over there. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On the second issue raised by the Deputy about a referendum, the Minister of State with responsibility for children hopes to have a memo for Government by the end of June.  The wording is being considered by a number of Departments, as outlined by him in the House about two weeks ago.  That matter is progressing as quickly as possible. </P>
        <P>On the third issue, namely, the Comptroller and Auditor General carrying out his work into the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, either through a special report or under the auspices of his office&rsquo;s powers, this will be done by statutory instrument and the advice is that it will not need primary legislation.</P>
        <P>The final issue the Deputy raised was in relation to mortgage arrears.  As he is aware, the Government has set up a group to examine the issues and it hopes to report by the end of June.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an example of what happens when a Government is in office for 13 years.  We are left with a national debt which has tripled in the past two and a half years to &euro;100 billion, with a deficit this year of more than &euro;20 billion, and a situation where the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State with responsibility for children are unable to answer a simple but serious question about the number of children who died in the care of the State over the past ten years.  We have had all this spin and waffle, along with the meeting that took place yesterday, and suddenly answers can be given.  As I pointed out yesterday, the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 requires that incidents be reported to the NTMA.  In terms of numbers, that information should have been available at the push of a button.  It is disgraceful that the Government is unable to get its act together and confusion is the order of the day, both within Government and the HSE.  Members of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s party have said it is now a &ldquo;dysfunctional Frankenstein&rdquo;. </P>
        <P>I was interested in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s comment to the effect that legislation pertaining to the wording of the referendum will be available by the end of June.  We have about 17 working days left before the House proposes to rise for the summer.  The T&aacute;naiste has said this is of such importance that it should be a stand-alone matter.  Let us see whether the Government is prepared to back up her words.</P>
        <P>Finally, the T&aacute;naiste said, in response to my question about the authority to be given to the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out the audit in respect of Dublin Docklands Development Authority, that it would be done by statutory instrument.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, wrote to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts on 22 September 2009, stating:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The Minister for Finance has indicated to you that it is not possible, arising from a Supreme Court judgment, to extend the remit of the C&amp;AG by way of ministerial order, as originally provided for under section 21 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.</P><Col N="606"/>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Amendment of primary legislation is a matter for the D&aacute;il, and in this instance amending legislation would be required to give effect to the Committee&rsquo;s request.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has responsibility for the Comptroller and Auditor General in this matter and he states in his letter of September 2009 that primary legislation will have to be amended, and that legislation is required for that to happen.  The T&aacute;naiste, however, says it is being done by statutory instrument.  The Minister with responsibility for the area says it requires legislation.  The Minister for Finance says it requires legislation.  Will the T&aacute;naiste now correct the record and indicate when this legislation will come before the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike the Opposition, we have to consider all issues before we make a final decision.  It is after a final decision has been made that we determine the methods by which we progress any issue.  In the context of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Could we hear the T&aacute;naiste without interruption, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the Government considered this matter.  Following that, the format in which this matter would progress was decided, namely, that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the T&aacute;naiste gave the decision some minutes ago. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the issue of the introduction of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s authority would be dealt with under the auspices of that authority to inquire into the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  The advice I have been given is that this is to be effected by way of an order under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, to be made by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il has Gormley where it wants him. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it a statutory instrument or legislation? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the situation and these are the facts I have to deal with this morning.  That is the situation with regard to the statutory instrument. </P>
        <P>On the issue of legislation, I have been asked to update the House on the work in progress under the auspices of the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, in relation to preparation for the referendum.  I have indicated that it is expected the Minister of State will bring a memo to Government around the end of June.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Where stands the docklands issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a final comment, to help the Ceann Comhairle. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot engage in debate on the Order of Business. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, but I beg to differ with the T&aacute;naiste here.  The Supreme Court judgment said, and I quote from the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s letter to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts in July 2009, that &ldquo;delegated legislation cannot make, repeal or amend any law&rdquo; and adds that to the extent to which the parent Act purports to confer such a power, it will be invalid having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.  Legislation is <Col N="607"/>required to transfer that authority to carry out the audit of the DDDA by the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office.  This apparently is an absolute unholy scandal and has been referred to by Deputy Hogan on frequent occasions and by Deputy Rabbitte <i>et al</i> on others. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is now engaging in debate. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Finance, legislation is required.  I am asking the T&aacute;naiste, as the deputy leader of the Government, when that legislation will come before the House.  Will it be before the House rises for the summer period? </P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, but I am not the line Minister in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Where have we heard that before?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I have indicated to the Deputy the situation that has arisen, following on from the Government&rsquo;s consideration, and the questions that need to be answered which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has requested.  It is on that basis, under a statutory instrument, that this transfer will take place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>He never comes in here any more.  This is a scandal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will Deputy Kenny resume his seat, please? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a scandal, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny, will you please resume your seat?  I have allowed you latitude.  Please resume your seat.  You are engaging in disorder on the Order of Business. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is the Minister to clear up this matter of primary legislation?  The T&aacute;naiste says&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>He is in the bog, cutting turf.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Richard Bruton on a point of order. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I just want to make a point of order to the effect that either the House was misled then or it is being misled now.  The House is entitled to know which is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste has replied to the question raised by Deputy Kenny.  The Deputy is going to have to pursue this with the line Minister.  I call Deputy Eamon Gilmore. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>She is not withdrawing the information that was laid before a committee and the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a couple of matters to pursue with the T&aacute;naiste.  I want to return to the issue on which she responded to Deputy Kenny about the transfer of the information by the HSE in relation to the children who died in State care.  Did I understand her correctly to say it is now the position that the HSE will transfer the information and legislation is not required?  If that is the position, how was this not established before the Government <Col N="608"/>took its position last Tuesday to the effect that legislation was required?  What has caused the change of heart and where stands the legal objection the HSE raised to the transfer of the information? </P>
        <P>Regarding her reply in respect of providing protection for people who are running into difficulties with their mortgages because of the recession, the T&aacute;naiste said the Government working group on this will report by the end of June.  For more than two years the Labour Party has been seeking a home protection scheme to provide protection for people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore, this is more appropriately addressed to the line Minister than raised on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We were promised this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are trying to get some order into the Order of Business because there is a serious breakdown of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a serious breakdown.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question being raised by the Deputy should, in my view, be posed directly to the line Minister by way of a parliamentary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is the line Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>No, a Cheann Comhairle.  The question I wished to raise, if you had done me the courtesy of waiting until I had asked it, is about ordering the business of the House.  The T&aacute;naiste says the working group on mortgages and home protection will report to Government by the end of June.  Since the Government proposes to put the House into recess at the beginning of July, when will the House have an opportunity to consider the outcome of the group&rsquo;s deliberations?  Will we have to wait until after the summer recess before the Government brings its proposals to the House?  Where stand those people who find themselves being brought before the courts for home repossession in the meantime?  With respect, a Cheann Comhairle, that is a question that is perfectly in order for the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask another couple of questions which, I submit to you in advance, are also in order.  The first is about the report on the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  This report was on the desk of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for five months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The missing Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We are now told he is to refer it to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  My understanding is that this requires an order to be made by the Minister for Finance to add the DDDA to the list of bodies that are covered by the Comptroller and Auditor General under the 1993 Act.  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell us when that order will be made?  Why, if that is the conclusion that has been reached by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has it taken five months for him to come to that conclusion?</P>
        <P>I also wish to ask about the bank inquiry.  Deputy Burton asked about this yesterday and on Tuesday.  We are told the two initial reports, from the Governor of the Central Bank and the external group, will be completed by 31 May.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm to the House that the report will be published before 31 May?  Given that the terms of reference for the subsequent statutory commission of investigation are to be based on those two reports, what arrangements will be made in the House for the report to be considered and the terms of reference?</P><Col N="609"/>
         <P>Finally, I wish to ask about the by-elections.  The Electoral Representation (Amendment) Bill was voted down yesterday by the Government.  We have had a number of proposals to move the writ for by-election; this was moved by the Opposition and voted down by the Government.  Has the Government given any consideration to the case of Dudley <i>v.</i> an Taoiseach, which was taken to the High Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>They will probably set up a review group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in 1994?  A vacancy had arisen in the House and had existed for some time.  The High Court granted leave to the applicant to institute judicial review proceedings against the Government.  In its judgment, the court stated: &ldquo;[T]here was an arguable case that the government of Ireland has a constitutional obligation to set down and to support motions for the issue of a writ for the holding of a by-election after a reasonable time had elapsed from the vacancy arising&rdquo;.  Given the fact that there is now a vacancy in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s own constituency which has existed for 12 months, has the Government given any consideration&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to stop the Deputy.  He is seeking detailed information on the Order of Business, which is not appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is asking for detailed information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>No, he is asking a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>He is posing a question to the T&aacute;naiste about a case in the High Court in 1994.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>No, about taking&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is much more appropriately addressed to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>No, a Cheann Comhairle.  I am asking, as I am entitled to, whether the Government has given consideration to the implications of that judgment and whether it intends to move the writ for the by-election.  We must bear in mind that the High Court said there was an arguable case that the Government has a constitutional duty to bring such a motion before the House where a reasonable period has elapsed.

	<P>I will take a number of the questions that have been asked.  With regard to the meeting that took place between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and the relevant people within the HSE, the undertaking given by the HSE was on the validation of numbers of deaths on foot of the letter sent by the Minister of State in March.  That work will be completed and brought to the attention of the Minister by the end of the week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>So it does not require legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">May I be allowed to answer the question?  The issue of legislation is appropriate.  Arising from consideration by the Minister of State himself on Monday of this week, when he indicated he was unhappy with the situation, he has taken further legal advice and has indicated that legislation will be required to address the issues with section 31 of the Children Act 1991.  The <i>in camera</i> rule, the data protection legislation and the issue of consent must be dealt with.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That legislation will be introduced by the Minister of State as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>With regard to the banking inquiry, the preliminary reports will be completed on schedule by the end of May and will be submitted to the Minister in the coming days.  The Government will consider them and the matter will then be laid before the House.  The second stage of the inquiry will then proceed, with the establishment of the statutory commission and the terms of reference in a draft Government order.  The establishment will need to be approved by Members of the Oireachtas.</P><Col N="611"/>
         <P>The third question was about the report on mortgage arrears which is due at the end of June.  I cannot pre-empt that work, which is ongoing.  If we can order our business to facilitate discussion on this, that is a matter for the Whips.</P>
        <P>With regard to the by-elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to return to the issue of the HSE files on the deaths of children in State care and the Government&rsquo;s assertion that emergency legislation is now required.  When will that legislation be presented to the House?  When will we see the publication of the promised Bill?  While I am not aware of any precedent, on this issue there is a veil of secrecy on how and why decisions are taken.  During my engagement with the Taoiseach yesterday it seemed that the mention of the Attorney General put him in a spin.  If ever there was a reason to publish the advice of the Attorney General, this is one justifiable case.</P>

	<P>The second issue I wish to raise is the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2009 which was passed in the Seanad on 6 May.  It is a critical item of legislation which it is hoped will guarantee after care for children in State care post their 18th birthday where that need presents.  When will the Child Care (Amendment) Bill come before the D&aacute;il now that it has completed its passage through the Seanad?</P>
        <P>There is great concern across the State among people who are involved in community development projects that they have been summoned to a special seminar on 10 June when it will be outlined to them how they will be able to go about transferring the assets and liabilities of their respective projects to the partnership companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in the context of promised legislation, if the Chair will be patient.  The local partnership companies will outline how the community development projects will wind down.  There is great concern through the length and breadth of the country as community development projects have made a huge and valued contribution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot allow the Deputy to engage in debate on this matter on the Order of Business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in terms of both urban and rural society.  Is there a basis in legislation or ministerial order for this planned wind-down of community development projects?  If not, is the Government looking at legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first issue, the Minister will have initial information made available and it is hoped to bring the legislation to the House by the end of June.  The Child Care (Amendment) Bill is awaiting Second Stage, and that is a matter for the Whips.  There is no legislation on the third matter.</P>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste said the ordering of legislation is a matter for the Whips.  Surely the Child Care (Amendment) Bill is something for the Minister and the Government to bring before the House.  I am not aware that the Whips make the determination as to whether legislation will present here that has already made its passage through the Seanad, concluding on 6 May.  It is a hugely important Bill and recent tragic events underscore the need for it even more.  Rather than kicking this to the Whips, which is a stock in trade answer in all of these cases, will the Government facilitate the presentation of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill before the D&aacute;il at the earliest opportunity?  The notion that the so-called emergency legislation in regard to the Health Service Executive files on the deaths of children can be expected to come before us by the end of June is unacceptable.  That is not emergency legislation and I wonder at the full import behind the Government&rsquo;s intent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>

	<P>If I do not bring this to the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s attention now, it becomes part of Standing Orders.  Since the 1980s it was always part of Standing Orders that legislation promised inside or outside the House falls into the category of promised legislation.</P>

	<P>Like other Members, I have repeatedly put down parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health and Children to which I have received the same answer, namely, that it is not possible to reply at the present time but if the issue remains a problem, I may bring it to the Minister&rsquo;s attention once again.  The Ceann Comhairle has advised me to put down parliamentary questions when I could not get answers to various issues.  I have followed his instructions &mdash; as has every Member of the House &mdash; and am now at my wits&rsquo; end.

	<P>Since the Government is not dealing with this issue and there is now only one political body, namely, the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security chaired by Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett, dealing with climate change, and in view of the fact that there is no sign of the promised climate change law from the Government, will the T&aacute;naiste take the climate change law that has been proposed by the joint Oireachtas committee and ensure its passage through the House once it is fully completed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Otherwise, the issue of climate change is not being dealt with, and most people would be astonished that the Green Party commitment has simply crumbled away.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>All we have is the promise of legislation but the Government has not given us any indication that the legislation is being published.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to accept the <Col N="616"/>legislation that has been put forward by the joint Oireachtas committee setting out the framework for tackling climate change, which is a duty on us internationally and also nationally, to ensure we live up to our commitments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has approved a framework for the climate change Bill which sets out the key priorities for the legislation.  I will raise with him the issues the Deputy has articulated today with regard to progressing the matter.</P>

	<P>When will it come back in here, T&aacute;naiste?</P>

	<P>I have not got a date as to when that can happen but I am sure it could be facilitated.  There is no issue with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">First, will the T&aacute;naiste clarify the timetable for the publication and presentation to the House and to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service of the two reports, the first by Herr Regling and Mr. Watson and the second by Governor Honohan?  I understand the Minister to have said, and I understand from the authors of the two reports, that they are being presented to the Minister for Finance on Monday evening, 31 May, as set out originally by the Government.  Presumably, the Government will receive them the next day.  Does that mean the timetable is that they will be released immediately to the House because the terms of the Government motion indicate that the Houses of the Oireachtas and the appropriate Oireachtas committee, the finance committee, will be invited to consider the findings of the report, and the terms of reference of the banking inquiry have to be dealt with by the end of June?  Given the limited number of sitting days available between Monday, 31 May, and 30 June, can the T&aacute;naiste indicate the Government&rsquo;s timetable for that?</P>
        <P>Second, on the &euro;750 billion proposed EU fund which is to be established in the context of the difficulties of the euro, we had an indication from the Taoiseach that it probably requires legislation.  Can the T&aacute;naiste indicate the timeframe for that legislation, given that it is proposed that the House will rise early in July?</P>
        <P>Third, in the context of the preparations for next year&rsquo;s budget, presumably Departments have been working through the McCarthy report.  Does the Government have any proposals to facilitate the House with a discussion on the position of each Department in regard to the implementation of those parts of the McCarthy report with which the Government intends to proceed?  It is almost impossible to do any kind of budget planning for later in the year unless we have some understanding of the fate of the recommendations in the McCarthy report.  In the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s own area, for example, we have the ongoing reviews of special needs assistants and no general information is available on the Government&rsquo;s approach, nor in regard to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation&rsquo;s area.  We have no indication of what the Government is doing with the recommendations in the McCarthy report, which were highly critical of investment in fourth level science and research and on which I believe there is cross-party agreement, which is important&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="617"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the House rises in July, will we have an opportunity to have a full discussion, in the context of the preparations for the next budget, on the position regarding the various elements of the McCarthy report?  There used to be a debate on the state of the economy for a few days before the D&aacute;il rose and it is clear that the biggest issue as we prepare to rise in July is what happens to next year&rsquo;s budget.  It is not possible to proceed without full consideration&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A debate is inappropriate on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of where the McCarthy report is now.  Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate if the Government intends to provide for that debate in the context of the budget because we will have the half year figures also?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has raised a number of issues.  First, with regard to the banking inquiry, I did articulate that the reports will be submitted to the Minister for Finance.  The Government will consider them and my assumption is that the reports will be laid before the House immediately.  The timeframe, as the Deputy is aware, is the setting up of the commission and the terms of reference and a discussion will take place in the committee during June.  We are working within the timeframe set in the order.</P>
        <P>Second, on the issue of the stabilisation mechanism and the discussions that took place in the House, as the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Finance indicated that further legislation will be required.  He is working on that currently.  The expectation is that it should be available next week for approval and consideration by the Government and then to progress to discussion in the House in June.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s final question, in the coming weeks these items of legislation will take up a considerable amount of the time of this House.  I do not anticipate that we will have time available between now and the end of the session for further discussions on the McCarthy report but we will evaluate the way matters are progressing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the significance of the McCarthy report to preparations for next year&rsquo;s budget, will the Government publish a White Paper on where the McCarthy report stands because it is impossible for the Opposition to second guess the Government in regard to budgetary preparation if we do not have information from the line Departments?</P>
        <P>As I stated, I picked the example of the review of special needs assistants that Members will be aware is being carried out on a school by school, SNA by SNA, basis at present.  We need a broad state-of-the-nation discussion about where the Government stands on the financial position of the economy by the time the D&aacute;il rises in July.  It is not possible to plan for next year&rsquo;s budget.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, a Cheann Comhairle, can I just say this to the Minister?  In the United Kingdom, in the run-up to the last general election and continuously as a matter of courtesy,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must advise Deputy Burton that we have a whip system in the House and this matter can be discussed among the Whips.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the finance spokespersons have a dedicated civil servant from the Treasury who provides the kind of information that I am looking for.  It is not possible to make plans unless one has some of the reliable information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter should be taken up at the Whips&rsquo; meeting.</P>
        <P>Before I call the next speaker, I wish to refer to something which was raised earlier in the House by Deputy Durkan.  The enclosure with the letter which was sent out last night sets out the various parts of the Order of Business under Standing Order 26.  The rulings, also attached, do not refer to legislation promised outside the House as this is expressly referred to in Standing Order 26 itself.  We do not feel it was necessary to circulate the Standing Order itself as Members should be aware of it.  In short, there is no omission in the letter re legislation promised outside the House as this is provided for in the Standing Order itself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>On the letter, it is also necessary for the Ceann Comhairle to clarify the position on Green Papers and White Papers, both of which are regarded, in previous rulings and in precedent, as promised legislation &mdash; one provides the general outline of the legislation and the other frequently includes even the heads of Bills.  The letter, as communicated to us, is not clear on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We will clarify it for the Deputy.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to be contentious but, so that the record will show, I believe that the record is not only unclear but wrong.  Therefore, I am in communication with the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office about it but I would suggest that he not make a ruling on it.</P>

        <P Just="Left">On the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department of Education and Skills brief, yesterday there was a ceremony by the survivors of Bethany Home, which was a residential institution for children, at an unmarked grave for 40 children who died, 27 of them in the space of a single year, in Bethany Home.  The Department of Health and Children has deemed that Bethany Home was within the regulatory and supervisory framework of the State under the then Department of Health but I am not so sure that the Department of Education and Skills has accepted that.  Can she accede to the request of the survivors that Bethany Home would be added to the legislation, the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002?</P>

	<P Just="Left">No, this is relevant.  We know of that only because of the 1934 legislation that required notification of infant deaths.  The following year we got it, but we do not have it for any of the other years.  Will the T&aacute;naiste, because it is her area of responsibility, conduct an investigation into all of the deaths that took place in Bethany Home?  Twenty-seven deaths is close to 15% of the child population&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the validity of the points being made but Deputy Costello will have to find a different occasion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;first, if Bethany Home can be added to the list; and second, if an investigation will take place because this is a matter on a par with what we are seeking from the HSE on deaths of children in its care over the past ten years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier in the Order of Business debate, as I suppose one could call it, the T&aacute;naiste indicated that she would welcome a decision to change the Standing Orders so that we could have Leaders&rsquo; Questions on Thursday.  If that is the case, all she has to do is tell her Whip, the Whips on the other side of the House will readily accept that and we can do it today so that it is finalised&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Stagg will be well aware, there is a process to be gone through.</P>

	<P>There are two problems and the Ceann Comhairle is aware of them.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for writing to the Ministers &mdash; in fact, his predecessor did the same &mdash; for all the good it did.  They ignored the Ceann Comhairle and the CPP which wrote to them and told them that they should answer questions properly.

      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The other issue the CPP wrote about was Ministers half-answering questions.  If there are two parts to a question, they will answer one and leave the other unanswered.  In fact, we proposed changing Standing Orders to deal with that and I would ask the Government Whip again, through the Chair, to look at that particular Standing Order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that was prepared by the officials in the House to deal with that particular aspect of it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is another issue I want to raise briefly.  Last Thursday morning, I asked the T&aacute;naiste about the Murphy report and the 90 provisions of that report, which are being implemented and for which a plan is in place to implement them.  I asked whether the Minister of State would come into the House to give a progress report and the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, who was sitting behind her at that time, agreed that that would be done.  In fact, they were anxious to do it.  The Whip was not in a position to clarify when that might happen last night.  Maybe the T&aacute;naiste could clarify when the Minister of State will come into the House in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Within the next two weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two or three matters.  It was promised some time ago that when the second prosecution was completed in the Roscommon incest case, the Roscommon incest report would be published and it would be debated in this House.  The second prosecution, which resulted in the conviction of the father, was completed some six weeks ago.  When will the Roscommon incest report be published; will it be published before the House goes into recess for the summer vacation and will the House have an opportunity to debate what is in that report?</P>
        <P>Second, on the promised legislation that was referred to under what I would describe as the unofficial leaders&rsquo; items this morning, as I understand it, we have now been told that tomorrow evening the HSE will publish the figure of the number of children who, it understands, died in care in the past decade.  I also understand it will not publish the figure of the number of children reported to be at risk in the past decade who have subsequently died.  Could the T&aacute;naiste confirm that?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is repetition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am led to believe the Roscommon report will be published around the end of June.  On the other matters, as I indicated to both Leaders, the information as requested by the Minister in March of this year will be forthcoming at the end of the week.  Legislation will then be required to be introduced in the context of the further investigations.  I have no other information to report.</P>

	<P>I think there is a confusion about this.  I refer to two elements of information which the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs sought following my seeking it back in February and March 2009.  The first was the number of children who died in care, which is the information, I gather, we will finally get tomorrow; the second was the number of children reported to be at risk to the former health boards and to the HSE in the past ten years who have died.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Ceann Comhairle did not interrupt me I would have completed my question by now.  I gather we will not be informed of the number of children reported to have been at risk who have died.  They are the children not taken into care, in some instances because of the failings of health boards or the HSE.  I am only asking that the T&aacute;naiste clarify that.  If she does not have that information, perhaps she would clarify it during the course of the day.</P>

	<P>On the same matter, it is important we know the figures for those who died in care and those who died while under the care of the HSE.</P>
        <P>I have a question about planning legislation.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will agree with me that last week has seen some of the best weather of the year yet on Tuesday night, two nights ago, eight of the 12 Dublin fire brigade ambulances were held up outside the Mater hospital for four hours, leaving four ambulances available for the rest of the city.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate because I want to ask about the licensing of health facilities Bill and whether it will address issues such as the suitability of a facility that cannot accommodate patients who are delivered to it by ambulance.</P>

	<P>With reference to the issue raised earlier by Deputy Durkan about parliamentary questions to the Department of Health and Children, I ask the Ceann Comhairle about the handling of such parliamentary questions by his office.  Like other Members, I have had replies to parliamentary questions from the Minister for Health and Children which state that due to industrial relations problems she was unable to reply to questions but she invited me and others to resubmit the question if it remained a matter of ongoing interest.  Now when I resubmit the question, the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office rejects it without even sending it to the Department because it is a repeat question.  Of course it is a repeat question.  I was invited by the Minister to resubmit it.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle to instruct his office that an invitation from a Minister requires the office to disregard the normal practice with regard to repeat questions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 13, line 14, to delete &ldquo;SIGNED&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;DONE&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment proposes using the word, &ldquo;done&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;signed&rdquo;.  We have debated this point on Committee Stage.  The convention uses the term, &ldquo;Done at The Hague&rdquo; on page 116 of the Bill.  I reiterate that the convention is done and is then open for signature and it can be signed by any state at any time.  Strictly speaking, it is not accurate to state that the convention was signed on 29 May 1993.  The point is it is open for signature then but it is not signed at that point.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that the common practice is to use the term, &ldquo;signed&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;done&rdquo; but my eminent legal adviser tells me that the term, &ldquo;done at&rdquo; is used in, among other legislation, the Aviation (Preclearance) Act 2008, the Harbours (Amendment) Act 2009, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008, the Chemicals Act 2008.</P>

There is no point in pushing the amendment but at the same time it seems to me more appropriate to use the word, &ldquo;done&rdquo;.  I think I have argued the case well, in so far as the word, &ldquo;done&rdquo; is the one that is used in the Bill on page 116, relating to the Hague Convention.  I will not press the amendment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 13, after line 37, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(3) Nothing contained in this Act shall prevent any person or married couple who applied to the HSE to be assessed for an intercountry adoption prior to the 1st January 2009 and subsequently obtain a declaration of suitability to adopt from effecting such adoption and having such adoption recognised under the law applicable prior to the coming into operation of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I will make reference to the amendments I am proposing in this regard.  I am proposing that in page 13, after line 37, to insert the following new subsection (3) &ldquo;Nothing contained in this Act shall prevent any person or married couple who applied to the HSE to be assessed for an intercountry adoption prior to 1 January 2009 and subsequently obtain a declaration of suitability to adopt from effecting such adoption and having such adoption recognised under the law applicable prior to the coming into operation of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>My other amendment arises later on in the legislation, on page 25 of the Bill.  I propose that the following additional subsection should be included and I quote:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">A person or couple who prior to the commencement of this Part, completed an inter-country adoption effected outside the State may not, notwithstanding this Act, effect another such adoption within five years of the former adoption from the same state, having first obtained a declaration of suitability in accordance with this Act, and such adoption may be recognised as if effected under the law applicable prior to the coming into operation of this Act.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">We are all aware that a substantial number of people are currently in the process of being assessed as to their suitability for adoption, primarily by the HSE, although other adoption agencies could carry out such assessments.  We know that the time-frame for carrying out assessments varies throughout the country.  In the context of a couple or an individual who wishes to adopt outside this State by seeking an inter-country adoption, if they live in Dublin, for example, and if they have applied to the HSE to be assessed, the current likelihood is that it will take between three to four years before they complete the process and the matter comes before the Adoption Board.  The Minister is on record as saying &mdash; I think he agrees with me &mdash; something that I have been saying for over a decade, that the length of time it takes for assessments to be completed is entirely unacceptable.</P><Col N="626"/>
        <P>In other parts of the country where the social work services are under less pressure, or where local health officers may work more efficiently in some places than in others, an applicant may find that their assessment for an inter-country adoption will be completed within about 18 months.  That is a reasonable period to go through an assessment process whereby a person is first required to attend some initiating courses so they fully understand the complexities of what is involved in inter-country adoptions.  An assessment is then carried out as to their suitability.</P>
        <P>There must be some reasonable time-frame to facilitate the relevant agencies, be it the HSE or an adoption society, in carrying out the assessment process.  There must also be time for people to reflect and, in addition, one must have regard to the fact that the HSE has other functions concerning children.  I think 18 months is the maximum reasonable period that people should have to wait to have an assessment completed and a report furnished to the Adoption Board after they have applied to the HSE to be assessed.</P>
        <P>This proposal is to address the concerns that many prospective adopters have, who are currently caught in the system.  While the Minister of State might know, I do not have the exact numbers of those currently awaiting the completion of an assessment by the HSE.  I would expect there are many hundreds of couples and individuals across the country who are in that position.  They started the process on the understanding that if they complete it successfully and get a declaration of suitability, the rules that would apply to the recognition of any adoption effected by them in a foreign state would be the law as contained in the Adoption Act 1991 and some subsequent amendments made to that Act.  That was, and has been since 1991, the bedrock legal foundation for the recognition in this State of inter-country adoptions and for the registration by our Adoption Board of such adoptions once they have been effected in a manner that facilitates their recognition under that Act.</P>
        <P>It is bad law to enact legislation that changes people&rsquo;s legitimate expectations and undermines their understanding of the end-game in the journey they started.  In the context of children, I personally do not like the use of the term &ldquo;end-game&rdquo;, which I have just employed.  What I really mean is that a couple may have commenced the process in 2007 or 2008, for example, and made application to the HSE to be assessed.  They then went through the course that was required by the HSE, and it was explained to them what the law was with regard to the recognition of foreign adoptions in this State.  They may currently be awaiting the completion of that assessment and if there is a declaration of suitability from the Adoption Board, I think it is reasonable that when they seek to effect an inter-country adoption, they should not find that the legal provisions applicable to the recognition of that have changed in mid-stream.</P>
        <P>This proposal is designed to ensure that continuity is maintained with regard to those who commenced that process prior to the publication of this Bill.  We know that there is a substantial number of people who have made representations to Members of this House and who are currently caught in the circumstances I have described.  They are greatly concerned as to the difficulties that might arise with regard to their completing an adoption following the enactment of this Bill, if their declaration of suitability is not obtained before the Bill comes into force.  That is the crucial date.  This amendment is designed to resolve that difficulty.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has prescribed special arrangements or rules for those who, at the time the Bill has commenced, already have their declaration of suitability.  It will be extraordinarily arbitrary as to which set of rules applies to such people, however.  When we embarked on the journey of debating this Bill, I think the Minister could have expected that we would have completed the legislative process more quickly than we have done.  It is not unreasonable that it has taken an amount of time to give an opportunity to Opposition Members and those <Col N="627"/>outside the House to consider the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, make representations, have hearings at the Committee on Health and Children, and reflect on changes that need to be made.</P>
        <P>Some changes have been made to the Bill as it has gone through that process.  It is arbitrary, however, in the sense that this process could be completed today, although that is unlikely.  It could be that Report Stage will be continued next week or the week after.  Nevertheless, by the time this Bill commences, a number of couples who commenced the process of seeking to be assessed in 2007 or 2008, for example, will &mdash; depending on where they reside &mdash; have declarations of suitability, while others will not.  Those who do have declarations of suitability will be in a different legal position with regard to the recognition of their inter-country adoption than those who do not yet have such declarations.</P>
        <P>A couple in Waterford or Cork may have applied to the HSE on 1 June 2008, and by the time this Bill is enacted they will have declarations of suitability.  Meanwhile, other couples who applied to the HSE in Dublin on the same date, will not be remotely near completing the process of having a report submitted to the Adoption Board.  That is arbitrary, unfair and could give rise to constitutional difficulties.  It puts couples &mdash; all of whom started from the same perspective, and were given the same legal advice with regard to how they can effect an inter-country adoption that will be recognised in this State &mdash; in entirely different positions based on the arbitrary nature of what date we complete the passage of the Bill, when the Minister makes the necessary commencement order, and the luck of where they started the process.</P>
        <P>It will also create difficulties for the Adoption Board.  I know we addressed this issue on Committee Stage but this is the first occasion on which we have been able to deal with it in detail in this House.  The Adoption Board will be put in the unenviable position, after the Bill has been enacted by this House, where there will be a brief period during which it may make some further declarations of suitability to adopt abroad in respect of couples, prior to the Bill&rsquo;s commencement.  Pressure will be put and great anxiety will be caused to prospective adopters and pressure will be put on individual Health Service Executive social workers, and the adoption committees that we will discuss later, to first, submit reports to the Adoption Board, make recommendations as to suitability and to get those recommendations and reports in to the Adoption Board with speed immediately this Bill is passed.  There will then be pressure on the Adoption Board by individuals who know appropriate recommendations have been made to the board to hold hearings to make declarations.</P>
        <P>I do not believe that is an appropriate process.  In circumstances where the recommendation from the Health Service Executive is that a couple or an individual is suitable to adopt, the Adoption Board may be able with some speed to hold a hearing and issue a declaration of suitability but there have been a small number of couples or individuals in respect of whom the Health Service Executive has recommended against making declarations of suitability in their favour and which have resulted in hearings in the Adoption Board of some difficulty involving social workers and adopters and they may not be able to be held with speed.  One may have a situation where simply depending on the nature of the recommendation made, one falls within the old law as it applies under the 1991 Act or the new law with regard to how one can go about effecting an adoption abroad that is recognised and the Adoption Board registers.</P>
        <P>Essentially, the first amendment that I read into the record is about trying to escape from that trap and that difficulty.  It is about setting out a circumstance which is clear, does not result in undue pressure being put on the Adoption Board or the new adoption authority to make declarations, allows for the completion of the process of assessment within the timescale required, albeit as I say in some parts of the country the timescales are unreasonable, without the date of commencement of the Bill being a crucial date in determining whether foreign <Col N="628"/>adoption will be recognised based on the criteria set down in the 1991 Act or the criteria set down in this Act.</P>
        <P>The second amendment I have tabled is to address an issue in respect of which we have also received representations.  A number of couples have adopted in various countries across the world, having been properly assessed as suitable and had their first adoptions recognised, and they wish to adopt again in the same country so that they will have a brother or sister for their already adopted child of a similar background to the first child they adopted.  They have concerns that provisions in this Bill would act as an obstacle to their doing that.  The aim of the second amendment I have tabled is to remove that obstacle and to try and ensure that occurs, but not in the context of the removal of acceptable standards to ensure that where there is such a second adoption the very strict criteria applied in existing law continues to apply to the recognition of that adoption and also without ensuring that they first obtain under the provisions of this legislation a declaration of suitability, which is very important.</P>
        <P>Although it is difficult to anticipate that there would be many cases where a couple or individual who has successfully previously got a declaration of suitability and adopted a child would at a later stage be deemed unsuitable to adopt a second child, of course circumstances could arise if it turned out that they did not properly care for the first child they adopted, so no one can assume that because one received one declaration of suitability that one would automatically get a second declaration.  Central to the way we deal with adoption must be the protection of the welfare of the child.  It is of course appropriate that there would be a further assessment, albeit the second assessment for a couple who has gone through an inter-country adoption should not require that they repeat all of the steps that they have previously been required to undertake for the first assessment to the extent of going back to do courses prescribed by the Health Service Executive to explain to them the complexities of inter-country adoption.</P>
        <P>One of the concerns I have in the context of couples and individuals who have successfully been deemed suitable to adopt, effected a foreign adoption and when they want a second adoption that on occasion it seems to me that the Health Service Executive treats them as if they never adopted previously, as if the whole thing is an entirely new experience for them.  There is a need to get a handle on what is happening in that context.  I am aware that when couples seek to effect a second adoption they are put at the back of the queue and very little real regard is had to the fact that perhaps a year or 18 months earlier they successfully adopted, having got a declaration of suitability and that much of the process that should apply to the initial assessment has ceased to be relevant to the second assessment.</P>
        <P>What should be primarily relevant to the second assessment is events that have occurred since the first adoption and obviously an assessment of how well the child in their care from the first adoption is doing, whether they are appropriate people who can cope with a second adoption and if it would be in the best interests of a child &mdash; that is the crucial issue &mdash; and that a second child would be placed in their care for adoption purposes and whose adoption we should recognise.  They should be the central issues in a second adoption.  A second adoption should not require attending at courses and repeating much of what was already undertaken first time around.</P>
        <P>The second proposed amendment is to deal with that issue.  We received representations on it from people who adopted in a variety of countries &mdash; some of the countries that come to mind are Ethiopia, Vietnam, Mexico and Russia.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, will report to us on the matter, as it was his view in regard to Mexico that the legislation presents no difficulty to people effecting a second adoption in Mexico.  As we were completing Committee Stage the Minister of State told those of us who attended the Select <Col N="629"/>Committee on Health and Children that he was meeting with parents who had adopted in Mexico to explain the situation to them because to fairly present what he had to say, he thought they were unduly concerned and that there was not a real problem in that area.  Perhaps when replying the Minister of State will explain to us the outcome of that meeting and whether he did so satisfy them and his view as to the necessity or otherwise of this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Four of the grouped amendments are in my name, namely, amendments Nos. 9, 18, 33 and 76.  Essentially, all of the amendments are about people who are caught in the transition from the old regime to the new regime.  They present real, human problems for the prospective adoptive parents concerned and indeed the prospective children who may be adopted in the process.  Of course the welfare of the child is paramount in all of this, but a number of situations arise in the amendments.  I acknowledge the fact that the Minister of State in amendment No. 75 has addressed some of the concerns by identifying the date of declaration as the date from which a person can adopt under the old system, but there are many other issues, some of which have been raised by Deputy Shatter.</P>

        <P Just="Left">He particularly makes the point that people&rsquo;s applications are dealt with unevenly across different parts of the country.  If I have applied for adoption in my part of the country I may well be at declaration stage now, whereas Deputy Shatter, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in or the Minister of State, who may have applied in another part of the country, might not yet be at the declaration stage.  It is clear that it is uneven.</P>
              <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have a number of other concerns about the transition period, some of which I am trying to address in amendment No. 18.  Deputy Shatter mentioned that some parents who have adopted in Mexico have met the Minister of State.  I understand the parents have a couple of outstanding issues in that regard.  I wish to raise some of their questions with the Minister of State.  Their main contention is that Mexico has signed the convention, but has a different system.  It does not use a central applications system.  The parents feel that difficulties are arising because we are asking the Mexican authorities to comply with the manner in which Ireland has interpreted the convention, rather than allowing them to interpret it in their own way.</P>

        <P>I would like to ask the Minister of State a specific question, which applies in general.  It has been put to me by the parents&rsquo; group.  The Adoption Board informed the group that the adoption declarations currently covered by the transitional arrangements may fall under the Bill when they are due for renewal.  This is contrary to the belief held by the wider adoption community.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether the arrangements will fall when their date of renewal comes up.  That is a specific question.</P>
        <P>I would also like to ask specifically about the 20 applications that were being processed in Vietnam when this issue arose.  I understand the Minister of State had discussions on this matter when he went to Vietnam.  There was a suggestion that the Vietnamese authorities, as a gesture of goodwill, would agree to process the 20 cases.  It seems that the board and the Minister of State are satisfied that there are no legal impediments to allowing these adoptions to proceed.  I would like an update on these specific cases because there seems to be some doubt about them.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 33, in my name, and amendment No. 32, in Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s name, address the so-called grandfather clause.  Having listened to the Minister of State, I changed the relevant period of time from ten years, as proposed in my original amendment, to five years.  Those affected by this measure have already gone through the process and were deemed suitable the first time round.  There is a genuine case to be considered when a family that has already adopted a child wishes to provide a home to another child from a similar cultural background.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that.</P><Col N="630"/>
        <P>I do not want to labour all the points I am making.  They relate to people who entered the process in good faith, under the regime that applied at the time, but are now caught up in this transitional period.  We need to show compassion for and understanding of these families, with the proviso that the best interests of the child are always paramount.  I do not suggest that anything unsafe should be done in regard to these children.  While I welcome the amendment the Minister of State has tabled, I ask him to consider the points being made from the Opposition benches in response to the real human situations in which families find themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I support amendment No. 2, in the name of Deputy Shatter.  There is a clear need not to place prospective adoptive parents in a limbo situation, or worse, as a result of this Bill.  In other words, we should not prevent them from proceeding with valid adoptions that are already partly in train.  This is a long and drawn-out process for prospective adoptive parents.  It is right that many safeguards have to be put in place.  The rights and safety of the child must be paramount in all considerations.  That is why I repeat that I welcome this legislation.  The State&rsquo;s ratification of, and full compliance with, the Hague Convention must also be welcomed.  It has to be recognised that there is a transition from the current legislative and regulatory regime to the new regime envisaged under this Bill.  Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s amendment is not only reasonable, it is essential in the circumstances.  It seeks to allow people who applied to be assessed prior to 1 January 2009 &mdash; the year in which this Bill was published &mdash; to obtain a declaration of suitability to adopt under the law as it was prior to the enactment of this Bill.</P>
        <P>As I said on Second Stage, many of the principal concerns about this Bill relate to the period of transition from the old system to the new system under this legislation.  There is a legitimate concern about what will happen to applicants who are already in the system.  I have made personal representations on behalf of a small number of applicants, from my own constituency and elsewhere, who have contacted my office.  They are concerned about whether they will be allowed to complete their adoptions under the old system, as new applicants commence under the new dispensation.  I ask the Minister of State to provide full clarification so that everybody fully understands exactly what is intended in that regard.</P>
        <P>Some prospective adoptive parents have made representations to me.  I would like to refer to an e-mail I received from one such couple.  They told me they believe the Minister of State has stated previously that he will consider providing for a three-month period after the enactment of this legislation in which prospective adoptive parents who receive declarations can continue to adopt from non-Hague countries.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify that for us.  If it is the case that the Hague Convention provides for a three-month settling-in period before adoptions can commence, would it not make sense for people to be allowed to continue to operate under the old regime throughout such a period?  When I examined the various amendments in preparation for today&rsquo;s Report Stage debate, I could not find any tabled by the Minister of State that would give effect to the couple&rsquo;s understanding of the suggestion &mdash; if not commitment &mdash; which was considered by the Minister of State some time ago.  I ask him to provide the clarification I seek.</P>
        <P>This Bill is very welcome.  There is no question that the regime we hope to introduce should be in place.  However, it would be wrong to detract in any way from the good that will be achieved.  We have to ensure that prospective adoptive parents, who are processing their respective applications and seeking declarations of suitability, etc., in the hope or expectation of the successful adoption of a child from a non-Hague country, are fully catered for.  The measures <Col N="631"/>outlined in this amendment, which I strongly urge the Minister of State to accept, would achieve that.</P>
        <P>I join in the appeal of my colleagues in strongly urging the Minister of State to accept this amendment.</P>

	<P>We have spent 40 minutes on this first grouping of amendments.  I know amendment No. 2 is important and central to the legislation but considering there are almost 30 groupings and extrapolating from the time already spent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the real world, if we are going to absorb so much of the time available to me in the D&aacute;il as the Minister of State with special responsibility for children and youth affairs, the danger will be that the other issues that the Members opposite are rightly frustrated about and the legislation I am meant to produce will be pushed back bit by bit.</P>

If Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in were honest with himself, he would see there has been a considerable amount of repetition this morning.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am entitled to make a point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, the Minister of State is entitled to make his point.  However, in fairness to Members there is no limit on their contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business this morning Members were genuinely frustrated about important developments in child protection law and legislation associated with the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  I share this frustration and that is why I made this point about time.</P>
        <P>The first principle of the legislation is to move to a regime governed by the Hague Convention, namely, that Ireland would adopt from countries with which it has a bilateral agreement or are compliant with the convention.  This is because we wish to ensure the best interests of children are at the centre and are given paramount consideration in the adoption process.  The Hague Convention sets down a series of standards and criteria to which compliant countries must adhere.</P><Col N="632"/>
        <P>However, I acknowledge significant delays have occurred in the completion of assessments from the Health Service Executive, HSE, and declarations from the Adoption Board.  This matter has been raised on all Stages in both the Seanad and D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>In response to this, after discussions with the Adoption Board and the Hague Convention, I have tabled an amendment that will allow any individual with a declaration at the establishment day of this legislation to proceed to completion, even if the application is with a non-Hague Convention or non-bilateral country.  I have compromised to that extent from which quite a number of people will benefit.</P>
        <P>I accept some will be disappointed because they will have not reached a declaration.  However, the policy, as set out in the Hague Convention, is clear in this respect.  Although Ireland signed the convention, it has not yet ratified it.  The legislation to transpose the convention has been around for 13 years.  There can be no doubt of the legislative direction.  I accept Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s point that it would be inhumane to ignore the fact that so many have had to ensure an unfairly prolonged application process.  In consultation with the Hague Convention, we have introduced this amendment to take cognisance of this.</P>
        <P>On specific country issues, I met with the Mexican groups on foot of representations from Deputies.  It occurred to me at that meeting that every sending country has a different adoption system and mechanism.  Mexico is Hague-compliant but the unusual part of its process is that the referral occurs before the birth of the child.  On paper it would be in breach of the Hague Convention&rsquo;s principle of subsidiarity.  I am satisfied that the court process that follows thereafter provides for the protection of the best interests of the child.  I have met individuals who have been disappointed in this process when the natural mother has changed her mind following the birth of her child.  All the disappointment associated with that underlies the robustness of this, with which the Adoption Board does not see a difficulty.  Inevitably, for any application to be entered into the register of foreign adoptions, the board would have to assess each application on its merits.</P>
        <P>Regarding the 20 applicants for Vietnam, this was a gesture by the Vietnamese authorities on the basis that we were proceeding to a bilateral agreement with them.  Events, however, interceded last summer with various international reports which caused us to postpone that bilateral relationship until such time as both countries are Hague-compliant.  Nevertheless, in attempting to proceed with the 20 applications, we wrote to the Vietnamese authorities to seek their views on whether they would be inclined to continue to accept these applications.  We have also prepared a mechanism that would allow these applications to continue.  This has been submitted to the Attorney General.  I accept this process is frustrating for the couples involved, many of whom I have met regularly.  However, this remains the position that we still intend to complete.</P>
        <P>My amendment to section 63 will address the issue of grandfather clauses.  It effectively will be a suspension of the first principle of the legislation for a prolonged period.  The transitional arrangement my amendment will introduce will delay the application of the legislation for a bit longer while Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan proposed five years.  I believe we have struck the right balance between the anxiety and difficulty for prospective adoptive parents and the first principle of the legislation to ensure all adoptions are Hague-compliant or are governed by a bilateral agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has not addressed the problem and his amendment is more technical than substantive.  I understood on Committee Stage we were at a point <Col N="633"/>where it was agreed that where there were declarations of suitability in place, a foreign adoption would be recognised in the circumstances in which we currently recognise foreign adoptions under the 1991 Act.  He has not addressed the arbitrariness of this as a transitional measure in the context of the unsatisfactory nature of the assessment process, the different timeframes that are there.  He has not addressed the issue that I raised, frankly.  In the circumstances, it would be my intention to press this amendment.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State clarify whether Vietnam has agreed to facilitate the processing to conclusion of adoptions for the 20 couples who already had their declarations of suitability and were in the adoption process?  The Minister of State remarked euphemistically that a mechanism has been found which the Attorney General is looking at to facilitate this process.  Can the Minister of State tell the House what that mechanism is?  That is not an unreasonable request.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to his amendment as resolving the problem of what has been referred to in brief as the grandfather clause but it does not resolve that difficulty at all because there are people who may have completed adoptions in foreign countries at the moment who do not yet have a declaration of suitability and will not have one when this Bill commences.  Unfortunately, the Minister of State&rsquo;s amendment does not address their concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand I have only two minutes to speak so I will not repeat what has been said.  The Minister of State has heard my views on these issues so I will seek clarification on the Vietnamese situation rather than repeat the questions put by Deputy Shatter.  What sort of timeframe does the Minister of State expect during which the Attorney General will consider the mechanism?  Are the Vietnamese authorities aware of the proposals coming from our side?  Is there likely to be a fairly quick decision in respect of this matter?</P>
        <P>I refer to the question of declarations covered by the transitional arrangements which may possibly fall when they are due for renewal.  I am unsure whether the Minister of State can clarify this on the floor of the House but, if not, perhaps he could clarify it at a later stage.  The group specifically stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The Adoption Board also informed the IMSG, the Irish-Mexican Group, that adoption declarations currently covered by the transitional arrangements may fall under the new Adoption Bill when they are due for renewal.  This is contrary to the belief held by the wider adoption community that current declarations will be covered by the transitional arrangements even after they have been renewed.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Minister of State may be unable to clarify the matter now but I would welcome if he could clarify it at some stage.  Since we will vote on Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s amendment first, I maintain it is very reasonable and I urge the Minister of State to accept it and to accept the points we are making under this amendment grouping.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the Vietnam issue.  I have no wish to go into specifics and I have stated as much to representatives of the group.  I have sought the view of the Attorney General and his office.  We have been through this for so long and we have built up people&rsquo;s expectations.  I have sought the advice of the Attorney General in a letter sent some ten days or two weeks ago.  The matter involves the Department of Foreign Affairs and my office.  A great deal of thought has gone into the matter with advice from the Adoption Board and the Hague Convention to try to effect a satisfactory situation.  We are on notice of inadequacies in the Vietnamese adoptions processes.  We have tried to effect even greater safeguards in terms of obtaining consents and in respect of financial contributions.  These issues have been raised <Col N="634"/>legitimately by international child protection experts in respect of Vietnam.  Vietnam co-operated fully with the inquiries made by UNICEF and ISS, International Social Services, on its behalf an accepted those findings.  This is what we are at.  The gesture was made on the understanding that we were proceeding to a bilateral agreement and in the absence of that agreement the difficulty arose.</P>
        <P>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan raised the issue of declarations and whether they would continue.  Under section 41, these declarations will run from the establishment day, that is, up to two years and up to a further 12 months at the discretion of the authority.  My information is that there is no change to this and that the concerns expressed are unfounded.  I do not accept the proposed amendments.  I believe we have struck the right balance in terms of the concerns genuinely expressed by prospective adoptive parents in respect of the length of time associated with the application process, in trying to ensure we have a robust system and the least possible dilution of the original intention of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not happy.  In the transitional period there will be individuals who are unfairly caught up in a change of law that they could not possibly have envisaged and whose assessment and application for the declaration of suitability has been unduly delayed by a grossly inefficient system, in which there is no uniformity of approach throughout the country and no timelines for anything to be completed by the HSE.</P>
        <P>Anyone who goes through the adoption process finds it very stressful.  They find the assessment procedure stressful as well.  Even if such people believe things are going well, they find it stressful awaiting the report and not knowing what the recommendation necessarily will be.  It is unfair to them to add an extra layer of stress.  If people are assessed and deemed suitable by the Adoption Board and if we properly apply the provisions of the 1991 Act, as amended, there is no reason why they should not be allowed to complete adoptions abroad which we recognise.  The specifications in respect of that legislation ensure particular standards are maintained.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problem with regard to Vietnam was the bilateral agreement with a monitoring committee that failed to monitor and report.  The Government was asleep on it for five years and did nothing and then it suddenly discovered from international reports that there could be a problem.  That is the reality of what has happened there.  The Government has gone down the road of negotiating&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shatter is aware that we made many visits to Vietnam and monitored the situation very closely.  It is completely inaccurate represent that on the floor of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It is absolutely accurate because the bilateral agreement in respect of Vietnam made express provision for the monitoring group.  When I sought inquiries as to what reports it had published, none were published.  When I sought to obtain information as to what internal documentation was available, none was furnished.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>As much monitoring was done as could be expected of a domestic Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State and his Department were going down the road of negotiating a bilateral agreement with Vietnam when they pulled out of it.  That happened because it started the negotiations too late and then it pulled out because of international draft <Col N="635"/>reports that came to the attention of the Minister of State.  There is no point in travelling that route other than to state that people were caught in difficulties because of what was, frankly, a failure of this State &mdash; not only of Vietnam with regard to standards &mdash; to monitoring the working of the bilateral agreement.  The issue of finance derived directly from the bilateral agreement which, wrongly, made arrangements to ensure particular payments were made which were not supposed to be linked to adoption but which, inevitably, would get caught up in it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why we are bringing forward this Bill and the sooner we get the Bill completed, the sooner we will have the standards to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, I did not interrupt the Minister of State.  That was why difficulties arose with regard to Vietnam which could have been pre-empted at an earlier stage.  The original bilateral agreement should never have contained provision for the making of financial payments for any purposes in Vietnam which could be linked to anything remotely connected to adoption.  That was a failure of Government and a failure of judgment by the relevant Minister of State.  It was not the current Minister of State, to be fair to him.  It was a failure of judgment by his predecessor and the senior Minister in that Department at the time when the bilateral arrangement was concluded.</P>
        <P>I refer to the 20 individuals.  I am very conscious that hope has been held out to them that, at least they would be able to complete their adoptions.  This has been going on for one year.  In fairness to them it is important that finality is brought to the matter.  I wish the Minister of State well in this regard and I hope he is successful in finding a mechanism that facilitates their completing the adoptions in circumstances in which we can be satisfied that the adoptions are sound and the factors and standards that must be adhered to are adhered to.  It is extraordinary how long this process is taking.  I ask the Minister of State to inform Members of the House, or at least the party spokespeople, in four weeks&rsquo; time as to where matters stand between him and the Attorney General.  The House will go into recess shortly and if there has been no developments by then, those individuals will be in contact with Deputies wanting to know what has happened.</P>
        <P>At times during this process, there has been undue secrecy as to what is going on.  People have been told not to talk about it in public or not to rock the boat.  They are not sure whether progress of any description is being made.  It is new information to me today that the Minister of State, within the last two weeks, has written to the Attorney General.  I hope that produces a fruitful outcome.</P>
        <P>It is of huge importance to this State that we are parties to the Hague Convention, that we apply it as soon as we can and that we apply proper standards to ensure the best interest of every child is protected in the adoption process.  Our original legislation sought to ensure that the standards we apply domestically in adoption were applied in foreign states to those adoptions we were going to recognise.  I do not see a difficulty in allowing for a transitional provision, such as the one I propose in amendment No. 2.  We must recognise the human circumstances, difficulties and concerns of those who are trying to process their suitability applications to a conclusion.</P>
        <P>The cut-off the Minister of State is proposing is arbitrary.  If the social worker who is assessing one is on maternity leave or takes ill, one might not get one&rsquo;s declaration of suitability.  People&rsquo;s destinies and hopes to have a family cannot be dependent on events as arbitrary as this.  My amendment avoids that type of situation being a problem, as well as the circumstances surrounding what seem to be structural delays within the HSE in processing applications in different parts of the country.  I am pressing the amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 14, to delete lines 8 and 9.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The purpose of this amendment is to remove references to adoption committees from the Bill.  There are consequent amendments that apply essentially to Chapter 1 of Part 4, which deals with adoption committees formed by the HSE.  The principal amendments of these propose to delete, in their entirety, sections 35 and 36, which deal with adoption committees.</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind the Minister of State&rsquo;s opening comments, I appreciate he may find it somewhat irritating that we are revisiting territory that we dealt with on Committee Stage.  We are revisiting it because we had a Committee Stage on which Members of the Opposition parties teased out what they saw as defects or problems in the legislation.  Normally on Committee Stage, the Minister, if he has not reflected before that Stage on amendments proposed, has time to hear the reasoning for particular amendments from those who proposed them.  He has time for reflection between Committee and Report Stages on whether he will take on board those amendments.</P>
        <P>The reality is he has taken on board very little of what was said by Opposition Members, who are from the Government&rsquo;s perspective, not just on this Bill but on other pieces of legislation, regarded apparently as redundant as legislators.  We fill a space and go through a process, but this is supposed to be a legislative process.  This is not about catching out the Minister of State or trying to politically embarrass him; it is about making our contribution to improve legislation.  The font of wisdom when it comes to legislation is not all vested on the Government side of the House or within individual Departments.  If such wisdom existed that was so perfect in its understanding, much of the legislation this House enacts would never have to be enacted because it would have been thought of decades ago.  We have an imperfect legislative process.  All of us are imperfect in our judgments and we do our best.  Not all the legislation that comes before us is necessarily in the best form.</P>
        <P>We are revisiting this issue again today and it is time consuming.  The Minister of State might find it frustrating, but it is a damn sight more frustrating from this side of the House because there is a terrible temptation for Opposition Members not to take the time it takes to sit down for the hours necessary to draft amendments of this nature for them simply to be dismissed by Government.  I can recall at time in the House in the 1980s and 1990s, and indeed up to 2002, <Col N="638"/>when amendments to legislation tabled from the Opposition side were taken very seriously.  I made a substantial contribution to the framing of child care legislation from the Opposition side because amendments were taken on board, but we are in a different ball game now where Ministers defend and reject amendments for whatever reasons and, generally, amendments are not taken in the spirit they are intended.</P>
        <P>I make no excuse for revisiting this issue in public because, although Committee Stage is in theory in public, no one in the media has the remotest interest in attending Committee Stages of Bills or reporting them and the public have no idea what is going on.  Part of what we are doing in this Parliament is informing the public as to what is going on.</P>
        <P>This legislation for the first time gives a statutory role to adoption committees run by the HSE.  Such committees have been in place functioning on a non-statutory basis for some time.  They function on the basis that a social worker carries out an assessment, prepares a draft assessment report and makes draft recommendations as to people&rsquo;s suitability or not to complete an intercountry adoption.  The report and the recommendations then go to an adoption committee.  Such committees have been formed piecemeal around the country, composed of whoever the local HSE managers think they should stick on them.  Some of them have well qualified people and some of them have people who have no qualifications or reason to be involved in adoption committees in the first place.  They sit in secret and they do not issue public reports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not know, and I do not think the Minister of State does, how many instances there have been of an adoption committee rejecting a recommendation of suitability from a social worker or reversing a recommendation that someone is unsuitable because the professionalism rests in the social workers carrying out the assessments.  I am, therefore, still mystified as to why these committees exist in the first place and, second, why we are now giving them a statutory role.  Third, I do not understand why experienced social workers cannot be trusted to carry out assessment reports under the supervision of a senior social worker who manages that section of the HSE within local areas and then to submit their reports to the adoption authority, which can hold whatever hearings are necessary.  I do not see the purpose of these adoption committees and, even more so, I do not believe they should be sitting in secret with persons appointed to them at the broad discretion of whoever it is within the HSE who happens to manage this issue in a local area.  I do not understand this.</P>
        <P>The committees produce no reports and, presumably, they are a cost to the HSE.  I presume people are paid expenses for their time sitting on them &mdash; they are not all volunteers.  Couples or individuals who have gone through the trauma of an adoption assessment process may then find themselves coming before a committee, which is a group of individuals who will either confirm the social work recommendation or second-guess it from a position of no expertise.  Many prospective adopters find this uncomfortable.  I have had reported to me one instance of someone on an adoption committee asking prospective adopters in whose favour a recommendation be made by a social worker whether they would have a dog in the house with the child they might adopt.  They did not know whether the person asking the question was in favour of or against the dog, whether they were to get rid of the dog or what damn relevance the dog had in the first place.</P>
        <P>I do not see the function of these committees and I am opposed to them.  My amendments propose that we get rid of them.  My view is that the structure we should have is that properly qualified, fully trained social workers carry out an assessment process and whatever information is required for adopters to understand what can be a difficult and complex process and the difficulties they may encounter in effecting an adoption abroad be made available to them in order that they are fully and properly processed.  An assessment report should then be prepared <Col N="639"/>in draft and given to the adopters for commentary to correct any factual inaccuracies, as happens in practice at the moment, and then, ultimately the recommendations should be made and the report furnished to the adoption authority.  There is no reason for these committees and I am resolutely opposed to them.  I will press this amendment in the context of what the Minister of State proposes.</P>
        <P>The provision in the Bill regarding these committees is quite extraordinary.  It allows the HSE to establish one or more of them.  How many will we have?  Will we have one representative of each of the 32 local health offices or will we have regional ones?  Will we have one for Munster, Leinster, Ulster and Connacht?  I do not know what we will have.  How many will there be?  Who within the HSE determines how many we have?  Will Professor Drumm, the chief executive officer, make the decision or will it be made locally by child care managers?  Who will decide how many we will have and what areas they will apply to?  If the Minister of State is serious about this, these provisions should be in the Bill.</P>
        <P>What qualifications will the people who are appointed have?  The Bill states they must have &ldquo;special knowledge and experience relating to the purpose of the committee&rdquo;?  What does that mean?  They can be employees of the HSE and, therefore, we may have another group of social workers sitting on a committee, although I doubt that will be the case.  Could it be the local guard, teacher or priest?  If it is the local priest, what influence might he have over the others on the committee?  If it is a person of experience, should one of the persons appointed be an adopter who has been through the process and who has an insight into, and understanding of, the worries and concerns of adopters?</P>
        <P>There is no specification in this proposal.  My principal amendment is to delete this provision from the Bill in its entirety.  On the assumption that the Minister of State will stick to the approach he took on Committee Stage, I tabled further amendments.  I do not see the purpose of the committees because they are being asked to second-guess what the adoption authority might decide.  They are a HSE creation, which the Minister of State has put into the legislation and which has not been incorporated into previous Adoption Acts.</P>
     
        <P>It is one of the few reforms in what is, essentially, a consolidating measure, outside dealing with the Hague Convention issues.</P>
        <P>My second amendment states that, if we are stuck with these, the legislation should delineate how many people should be on a committee.  At the moment one could have a committee of 500 if one really wanted to.  Is there an option regarding the committees to be formed?  Will a committee comprise three, five, seven, 10 or 25 people?  That is not clarified.  The amendment I propose is that subsection (4) be included in the Bill to read as follows: &ldquo;The membership of an adoption committee shall not exceed 5 persons.&rdquo;</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The amendment to subsection (5) proposes each adoption committee shall comprise at least one member who is a senior social worker, a child psychologist, a child psychiatrist and a person who has adopted a child at least three years before their appointment to an adoption committee.  I do not believe that is an unreasonable proposal.  If we are going to set up such committees, it should not necessarily be a committee comprising a few golfing friends of the local child care manager whom he or she believes are interested in adoption and should be put on the committee.  This is not the right way to deal with the sensitive issue of adoption.  It is completely unnecessary that these committees were brought into existence in the first place and it is entirely unnecessary that they are to be retained in this Bill.  However, if they are to be retained, let us at least determine how many people should be on a committee and set out minimum qualifications.  Let us at least ensure that one out of the five is someone with experience at first hand of adopting a child.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 57 is in my name and I wish to address the issues involved.  It seeks to insert &ldquo;or to an accredited committee or body on behalf of the executive&rdquo;.  The Bill makes provision for accredited agencies under Part 13.  If accredited agencies carry out assessments, these still have to go through the HSE process and subsequently go to the Adoption Board, which makes the final decision.  I am suggesting that this is an unnecessary number of steps.  I do not see what the role of the HSE is in this regard.  We already know that HSE social workers are under enormous pressure.  The Minister has said that more will be appointed this year, but I believe that will be for other purposes within the HSE. </P>
        <P>I take the Minister for State&rsquo;s point about not unnecessarily extending the debate, but we know that there is a very long waiting time in many parts of the country before people are assessed.  It seems that this is adding an extra layer of bureaucracy for no good reason.  Obviously, we want to ensure that the process is thorough, but I agree with Deputy Shatter that the people who ultimately have responsibility in that regard are the social workers, the professionals.  This responsibility is within the caveat that it goes to the accredited body or the HSE and then it goes before the Adoption Board.  Essentially, I do not believe we need this extra layer in the case of accredited agencies who may carry out assessments, as I understand it, under the Bill.  That is the purpose of my amendment.</P>
        <P>I support Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s points about these bodies being set up by the HSE which appear to be very vaguely defined and constructed.  Again, I wonder what is their purpose.  I take his point that if they exist at all, they should at least be manned by people who have the appropriate expertise.</P>
        <P>All these amendments are designed to improve the process as regards the assessment of families without in any way endangering the process in terms of its thoroughness, rigour and the task of ensuring we comply with the process as we should.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I was waiting to hear the full extent of Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s arguments in relation to his proposal.  Perhaps the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply will better inform my judgment on this, but maybe there is an unnecessary further tier of bureaucracy. </P>
        <P>If it is, indeed, unnecessary, it is something which will have to be reflected in the legislation by the withdrawal of the relevant sections.  I am interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say in terms of arguing for the inclusion of such committees.  If it is the case that his argument is sustainable, I wonder whether, in the light of Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s amendment No.59, it might not be possible to consider representation from the adopted and those engaged in direct support in terms of children&rsquo;s rights across the country.</P>
        <P>The options Deputy Shatter outlined include a senior social worker, a child psychologist, a child psychiatrist and a person who has adopted a child.  I wonder, if it is to be more than five and there are only four, whether, in the event that these committees are to be maintained within the legislation and the Minister of State believes they have a worthwhile function, it might be a good idea to consider representation on such committees from those who have been through the process not as adoptive parents, but rather as adoptees and representatives of one or any number of the NGOs that are doing Trojan work in the whole area of children&rsquo;s rights and the protection of children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given out about the time aspect, but I have no problem revisiting everything.  I understand why we are here on Report Stage.  It is just that the prolonged timeframe will have a serious impact on how long this legislation is going to take.  It is worth putting that in the public domain. </P>
        <P>I am sure Deputy Shatter has heard stories to the effect that an applicant couple may not have hit it off with a social worker.  This happens all the time.  It is hard to give statistics, but I <Col N="641"/>hear anecdotally all the time about applicants who are in terror of a social worker they did not form a bond with, or they might believe that he or she is unnecessarily oppressive in the manner in which they are being examined through the process of assessment.</P>
        <P>The adoption committee, therefore, gives an opportunity for an applicant perhaps to ventilate issues that were unsatisfactory in the assessment by the social worker.  I can see why people, on paper, might see this as a further unnecessary layer of bureaucracy, but one cannot ignore the fact that in the normal course of human engagement these types of issues can arise, and they have been brought to my attention.  I firmly believe that the adoption committees are a good way to ensure that people who are suitably qualified have an opportunity to assist the authority in the work it is supposed to do.</P>
        <P>Also, I want to challenge the perception that I am not open to considering amendments.  On Committee Stage, I tabled an amendment to ensure that persons appointed by the HSE have relevant knowledge and experience as set out in the section, as it is now, on foot of representations made by Deputies and Senators, in particular Deputy Shatter.</P>
        <P>The people appointed to these committees have specific knowledge and experience of the work they are expected to do, that is, to assist the authority with regard to its obligations under the Child Care Act and also to make recommendations to the authority about eligibility and suitability.  There are ten or 11 adoption committees in the country and the personnel on those committees are child care managers &mdash; the type of person the Deputy has described in his alternative wording.  However, I do not think it is necessary to be so restrictive or go into that level of detail.</P>
        <P>There is a requirement to have that knowledge and experience; it is now, for the first time, a statutory requirement, which constitutes a safeguard to ensure these people are qualified.  In addition, the adoption committee affords an opportunity for dealing with a situation that often occurs &mdash; I have heard this anecdotally, but it is almost impossible to elicit the information in any other way &mdash; in which social workers do not get on with an applicant, or there is some grievance on the part of the applicant.  It is for those reasons that I will not accept the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have had the same experience as the Minister of State described of learning not just anecdotally but first-hand of cases where prospective adopters have not got on with social workers.  On some occasions they had valid grounds for complaint, while in others they did not.  I have never yet had the experience that the adoption committee has been of remote help in these circumstances, because it has tended usually to regard as something of a nuisance adopters who say they do not get on with the social worker.  If one does not get on with one&rsquo;s social worker and there is some personality clash, that is a matter to be dealt with internally by the HSE or the adoption agency and to appointment a different social worker to deal with an individual or a couple.  It should never get to the point where one gets to the end process with a report that one is unhappy with because of a relationship difficulty with a social worker.  We do not need committees to monitor that, and we certainly do not need 11 of them.  What consistency of approach, if they have a function, could you have between 11 different committees?  The fact there are so many is questionable.  We have one Adoption Board and now we will have one adoption authority.  Why do we need 11 committees?</P>
        <P>I take in good faith the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation, genuinely, that he sees this as a moderating force where there is a problem with a social worker, but if there is a problem in relationships there should be a different mechanism to deal with that.  I have had first-hand experience of dealing with people who have had genuine problems going through the adoption process because of personality clashes with social workers.  I have never heard one example of an adoption committee satisfactorily resolving that issue.  Where the issue is usually resolved is <Col N="642"/>at a hearing in front of the Adoption Board, which reaches its own conclusion, having heard all the parties, about whether someone is suitable.</P>
        <P>I genuinely do not believe adoption committees have a role in this and I intend to put the amendment to a vote.  I appreciate that Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in may want to contribute, but I am happy to put the amendment on the basis I have presented it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder if the Minister will address the points in my amendment.  He has addressed Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s amendment, which I appreciate, but the point I am making in my amendment is somewhat different: if an accredited agency is carrying out an assessment, it should not have to go back to the HSE and then the Adoption Board, which it must do anyway under section 40.</P>
        <P>To return to the previous point, a committee of different people is not necessarily the appropriate mechanism for dealing with difficulties with social workers.  The appointment of an alternative social worker would seem a more practical way of addressing any personality issues.  I agree this does happen; I have heard of such cases myself.  It is just a question of finding the most effective mechanism for dealing with it.  It might be more practical for somebody senior to consider the situation and perhaps decide to assign a different social worker.  I cannot see that the problem would necessarily be resolved by having such a committee deal with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened to both sets of views expressed.  I too have experience of adoption issues and the difficulties that can present.  The picture painted by the Minister about some of the relationships, or the absence of a relationship of any merit, between proposed adoptive parents and their social workers is a valid one.  Yes, it happens.  However, I do not know that this translates to a need for adoption committees.  I do not think it will be a panacea for that difficulty, nor has it been in the past.  The idea that a committee is needed to solve relationship difficulties that may arise in the course of an assessment process is not correct.  The issue should be dealt with in a much more direct way.  When a difficulty presents, there must be an appeals process directly within the system, through which the couple concerned &mdash; the proposed adoptive parents &mdash; have an opportunity, not to seek comfort from others who would offer them sympathy or whatever it might be, but to resolve the relationship issues.  A committee is not needed for this.</P>
        <P>In the event that the Bill proceeds without these amendments, what is the current position?  Will the Minister of State take note of what I have suggested about amendment No. 59, in Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s name, in terms of the make-up of these committees?  Is it currently the case in the 11 committees to which the Minister refers, or is it expected to be the case in the future arising from this legislation, that people who have been through the adoptive process as adopted children have, in their adult lives, an opportunity to make a direct contribution?  I am of the view that these people in particular have a valuable contribution to make.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>If applicants have a grievance with a social worker, how can they raise it?  Whom could it be raised with?  Could they raise it with the child care manager?  People are nervous about doing that.  If they come to an adoption committee that has been set up for <Col N="643"/>the first time in statute, it will give them greater comfort and provides safeguards which do not apply when a matter must be raised with a child care manager.  One must phone an office and say &ldquo;I am not happy with my social worker and I want a new one&rdquo;.  Based on my experience, this is not a satisfactory solution.  We have a much better safeguard now if such difficulties arise: an adoption committee with a set of skills, including, possibly, that of a psychologist, and knowledge beyond that of a social worker.  If the entire decision is left to a social worker who could be wet behind the ears &mdash; there is no guarantee that one&rsquo;s social worker will be experienced &mdash; that is the recommendation that then goes to the Adoption Authority.  Is that a satisfactory situation?  I do not believe so.</P>
        <P>To deal directly with Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s point about an accredited committee, the HSE continues to carry sole responsibility under the Child Care Act for the protection of children and therefore it would not be possible to circumvent entirely the HSE at the end of the accreditation process, even though it is being carried out by a body other than the HSE.  It needs to come back to the HSE because it is its responsibility to decide whether a positive recommendation or otherwise should be given.  That function cannot be given to an accredited agency.</P>

	<P>Would the Minister be good enough to reply to my point about the future role in these committees of people who have been through the adoptive experience?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing to preclude an adopted person from being included in that because he or she would clearly have knowledge and experience as defined in the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No social worker who is, as the Minister of State describes it, wet behind the ears should be carrying out adoption assessments in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the Deputy&rsquo;s description.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it was, and it is a problem.  No such social worker should be carrying out adoption assessments.  Second, there should always be a senior social worker or a child care manager in charge if there are personality difficulties.  Those are the people to go to and that should be made known.  Anybody going through an assessment process should be told that if a difficulty arises, they can talk to such and such a person and they will not be prejudiced by having that conversation.</P>
        <P>The reality is &mdash; and I say this categorically from my experience going back over a number of years &mdash; these committees never act as moderators to resolve difficulties in respect of individual social workers.  They only come into operation when the assessment report is complete and there is a draft recommendation.  In my view, these committees were formed by the Health Service Executive as cover in case something went wrong.  The HSE does not want responsibility for anything, it wants to be able to say that if somebody was recommended as suitable, it was not the responsibility of the HSE&rsquo;s social worker and that it was this adoption committee of outsiders who copperfastened it.  We do not need these committees; they have no role and no function.  I am sure the Minister of State means this in good faith, but I have absolutely no doubt that this particular provision, if the Minister of State goes into the history of the drafting of the legislation, is a result of lobbying by the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The other odd aspect of these committees is that they apparently live in perpetuity.  According to the Minister&rsquo;s amendment the committee is appointed and has no particular life span; it could go on for ten, 15 or 20 years with the same group of people.  There are no provisions as <Col N="644"/>to what one does to sack someone who behaves inappropriately on a committee.  There is no provision as to whether every five or six years, say, the membership should change.  Nor are there provisions to ensure gender equality of some description on the committee.  The Minister of State stated that he tabled the brief amendment to which he referred as a consequence of the amendments I tabled, but it is not adequate.  This is an ill conceived, ill thought out part of the legislation.  Its provisions are based on the influence the Health Service Executive has exercised over the drafting of the legislation.  Not only do these committees serve no purpose but there is express provision for the making of payments for travel and subsistence.  We have 11 people travelling around the place incurring unnecessary expense for the taxpayer and not advancing one whit the protection of the welfare of children.  I wish the Minister of State had taken on board the amendment we are proposing.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said in reply to Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan that where there is an outside accredited agency carrying out assessments, it must, because of provisions in the Child Care Act, come back to one of the committees.  The accredited body or its social worker cannot make a direct recommendation and report to the adoption authority.  That is hogwash.  Under the current system independent adoption societies can carry out assessments which go directly to the Adoption Board; they are not being second guessed by adoption committees.  These committees only apply within the life line of the HSE.  This provision is absolute nonsense.  If it were legally valid, every adoption completed as a result of a report as to suitability, be it a domestic or foreign adoption, with the assistance of an adoption society as opposed to the HSE would presumably have questionable legal validity, as might the adoptions that have followed the creation of the HSE.  If that is the advice the Minister of State has been given it is complete nonsense.</P>
        <P>The formula depends essentially on what is prescribed in the legislation.  If we were to be stuck with this, the accredited body should of course be able to carry out its assessment and make a direct recommendation to the adoption authority.  The Child Care Act is not a constitution; it does not have some overriding impact on the adoption legislation.  That can stand on its own.   I do not accept these provisions and I will press the amendment.</P>

    <Title>Nurses and Midwives Bill 2010: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy Cyprian Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to complete my contribution on this Bill.  As I stated on the last occasion, the nursing and midwifery professions have for quite some time been taken for granted.  There have been significant changes in these careers over the past number of years and the educational requirements for nursing have changed drastically.  As I stated on that occasion, the introduction of degree qualifications and the ongoing training and education while in the job have led to highly qualified and highly skilled professional staff, particularly in the specialist nursing areas.  Today&rsquo;s nursing profession is a far cry from what it was a decade or 20 years ago.</P>
        <P>The introduction of this legislation provides protection for those engaged in the profession but also for their clients.  The Bill also further enhances the opportunities for recognition of qualifications, specifically by ensuring that the employers and management in hospitals are obliged to facilitate nurses and midwives in maintaining and improving their professional competence.  That has been a considerable issue over the years.  For a long time there was little scope for promotion in the nursing profession.  That has changed drastically over the past number of years and this is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>In the past, usually the spotlight was put on the nursing profession only when a particularly nasty case of malpractice or abuse arose and ended up in the media.  Given the highly personal nature of the business of nursing, nurses can often find themselves in situations where they are open to false accusations.  While patients can suffer due to incompetence or a lack of commitment, the onus is always on the professional to ensure that there is an adequate service provided.  The strengthening of the fitness to practice committee in this legislation and the hearing of inquiries in public in most cases will protect both the patients and the service providers, and a robust system of accountability is crucial to both sides of the equation here.</P>
        <P>Turning to the main element, the Bill provides for repeal of the Nurses Act 1985 and for a new legislative framework in respect of nurses and midwives, and makes provision for enhanced protection of the public in its dealing with the nurses and midwives.  Given the nature of these professions and the intimate and personal nature of them, that is very much to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The recognition of midwifery as a separate and distinct profession is also to be welcomed.  Anybody who has been blessed to have gone through child birth can only admire midwives and their dedication to their profession.  There is provision for clinical supervision of midwives, who must have adequate indemnity insurance.  Insurance in the medical industry in general is a significant issue and is something that raises its head on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>The provision of a non-nursing-midwifery majority on the board and on its fitness to practice committee will ensure that the highest standards are maintained and that those who are dealing on a daily basis with the issues that arise have an input and a say in how the profession goes on in future.  The Bill also provides for a stronger governance and accountability structure for the board, which is important.  In these days of extremely high requirements in corporate governance in general, it is correct that a strong structure is put in place from the start.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides for an improved investigation mechanism for complaints about nurses and midwives, including the establishment of an assessment committee prior to the fitness to practice investigations, and also the appointment of investigators to facilitate such preliminary investigations.  Everybody is due a fair hearing and this piece of legislation will ensure that such is the case.</P><Col N="647"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill ensures the registration of nurses and midwives and also the registration of candidates for first-time registration with the board, and the re-registration of advance nurse and midwife practitioner posts.  This also ensures very high standards.</P>
        <P>As I stated at the outset of my contribution on the last occasion, this is a profession that for many years was taken for granted.  It has evolved in recent times into a highly professional skilled job.  I have often heard it said that nursing is not only a job but a vocation.  I welcome the introduction of this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, in introducing the Nurses and Midwives Bill before this House two weeks ago, was at pains to point out that nursing and midwifery are the cornerstones of our health service and that Irish nurses and midwives have long enjoyed a fine reputation, both at home and overseas.  She went on to state that this Bill is a key component in the construction of a system of governance and accountability for the health services which has the public interest and patient safety as the focal point.  Those were fine words, indeed, noble sentiments, but unfortunately, straight from the manual of spin and doublespeak.  I must ask how the Minister can reconcile these statements with the fact, according to the INMO, that we have lost 1,900 nursing and midwifery posts since the imposition of the public service moratorium, how she can reconcile these statements when none of the 1,600 2009 qualified graduates have been offered a post in the Irish health care system and how she can reconcile these statements when 1,064 hospital beds have been closed and are unavailable.</P>
        <P>It is all very well to enact legislation on governance, but what type of chaotic skeletal health care system is the Minister trying to govern?  No amount of window dressing will allow the Minister escape and dodge the fact that in her many years in charge of the health services in this country she has actively presided over the creeping introduction of a business-model based health system for the Irish people.</P>
        <P>It has become clich&eacute;d but anybody who has been in our hospitals recently will have experienced Irish nurses and midwives under severe pressure trying to provide a most necessary service as they struggle to do the jobs of two or three.  When their colleagues retire or go on maternity leave or sick leave, they are not replaced, all because of the public service embargo put in place by the Government.  Increasingly, they are working in an environment where quality in the delivery of care is really secondary to the issue of finance, despite what the Minister might say.</P>
        <P>From talking to nurses and staff working in our health services, morale has never been so low among staff, everywhere within the service and in every role.  The public service recruitment embargo has undermined the value of their contribution to the health system in the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt that science and technology and matters of governance and regulation are thriving in medicine.  However, the Minister and Government should never think that because they have all the tools such as legislation, degree-led education and new corporate bodies, that this is the whole package; humanity and empathy for a patient&rsquo;s position are needed as much now as any time in the past.  The Minister must take cognisance of the universal fact that the more prescriptive one becomes, the more one dilutes these characteristics.  This is a balance she will need to continuously address.</P>
        <P>When the Minister talks about governance and best practice with regard to nursing and midwifery, I suggest she considers the Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital which serves not just Limerick, but also Clare, north Tipperary and parts of north Cork.  The hospital delivered 5,463 babies in 2009.  One of the 5,463 babies born in 2009 in the hospital was my daughter Alma Maye Carey.  My wife, Grace, gave birth to Alma on a bright summer&rsquo;s morning on 15 <Col N="648"/>June last.  Coincidently, five days later, a young fellow called Fionn Plunkett was born to very close friends of ours, Tadgh and Catriona Plunkett.  Fionn&rsquo;s birth was followed by Saoirse Fitzpatrick who is the second grandchild of my constituency secretary, Kathleen Fitzpatrick.  I will not leave out little James Buglar, the son of my personal assistant, Paul and his partner Shula.  It could be said we kept the maternity hospital in over-drive for the month of June 2009 and there must have been something in the water in late 2008.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the midwives, nurses, doctors and staff based in the maternity hospital in Limerick for their professionalism.  My experience of childbirth and that of my wife was made so much easier by these wonderful hard working people.  One of the consultants based in the hospital was in touch with all the Oireachtas Members from the mid-west early this year.  He wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The infrastructural situation at the hospital has become very depressing &mdash; it is now very close to something that could justifiably be described as a shambles.  Shabbiness, over-crowding and a general inadequacy of facilities is the routine experience of patients from the moment they arrive in the car-park until they leave again and as they progress through almost every clinical area in the hospital.  The term &lsquo;public squalor&rsquo; comes to mind.  Were it not for the fact that we have a very good core of permanent staff who reside in the region, who are very committed to looking after their own community and who take great pride in their work, things could be very much worse.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" Just="Left">These and other problems have been caused by a lack of strategic planning, poor governance structures and chronic under-funding.  There is a plan to re-locate the hospital to the Dooradoyle site, but this is not being progressed because no political decision has been made.  The disempowering and centralised nature of the current HSE structures means that there is no local decision making of any description.  The maternity hospital has an annual budget of &euro;18.5 million  In comparison, the three Dublin maternity hospitals have budgets of between &euro;62 million and &euro;65 million per annum &mdash; they do about 8,500 deliveries each annually.  In other words, the Dublin maternity hospitals have about 350% of the Limerick funding to deal with about 150% of our deliveries.  They each have their own labs, management, financial and human resources set-ups, which is hardly an efficient use of national resources.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I read this letter into the record of the House in order to make the point again that all the legislation in the world with regard to governance and best practice cannot mask the fact that the Government, of which this Minister is a part, presides over many fundamental cutbacks which are affecting both patients and those working on the front line of public service, in this case our nurses and midwives.</P>
        <P>There is a fine veneer for public consumption but little attention and in many cases deliberate attacking of the structures that would create a proper public health service.  This is driven by a specific political ideology as presented by the Minister for many years, the Boston versus Berlin model.  However, in the meantime, even the Boston model has now incurred changes with President Obama&rsquo;s reforms and yet in Ireland, under the stewardship of the Minister, we are happy to continue on down a road of health care provision that is in the process of being abandoned internationally.</P>
        <P>The governing structure as proposed by the Minister in this legislation is at odds with the Minister&rsquo;s assertion of having the public interest and safety foremost in her mind.  The current board consists of 29 members, 17 of whom are elected by nurses and 12 of whom are appointed by the Minister for Health and Children.  The new board will have 23 members, 15 of whom are appointed by the Minister and eight elected by the professionals.  The eight members of <Col N="649"/>the new board are supposed to represent each discipline of nursing and midwifery.  This, on the face of it, represents a slimmed down quango.  However, I do not agree with the shift in balance between elected representation and ministerial appointment.  The fact that the board, as envisaged by the Minister, is not allowed to comment on the environment within which nurses and midwives work does not indicate best practice for either nurse or patient, in my view.  The fact that there does not appear to be any provision whereby the board has some advisory role to service-providers on staff shortages, physical environment, poor quality or unsafe conditions, is at odds with the Minister&rsquo;s stated intentions in relation to public interest and safety.</P>
        <P>Our party spokesperson on health, Deputy James Reilly, asked the question last week about the subtle but important distinction as to the manner of how this new board is to be appointed and the independent powers at its discretion, in contrast to those that apply to a body such as the medical council.  I have noticed a similar distinction in much new legislation over the past 12 months.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, immediately spring to mind, now to be joined by the Minister for Health and Children, in that much more power and influence is being transferred to the Minister&rsquo;s office.</P>
        <P>It is also interesting to note it seems quite likely that most costs associated with this new board will be met by nurses and midwives through increased registration fees. It brings to mind the establishment of the Teaching Council a number of years ago whereby the teachers of Ireland pay an annual subscription to this body with little discernible benefit accruing to them. In essence, the project has become a money-making exercise dressed up in the clothes of professionalism and advancement of standards.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the superb work of the nurses working in Ennis General Hospital. Despite all the cutbacks and budgetary constraints as a result of the policy to centralise all acute services in the mid-west, the nursing staff at the hospital have remained at all times ultra-professional and dedicated to delivering the best possible service.  The decision by the HSE 12 months ago, under the direction of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, has allowed the balance of health care provision swing towards the private sector.</P>
      
        <P>There is much evidence that many Clare people who are lucky enough to have medical insurance are now opting for the Galway Clinic as their hospital of choice, even for acute services.  This is an appalling indictment of the Government&rsquo;s failure to provide basic health care for its citizens.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The HSE&rsquo;s administrators have stripped Ennis General Hospital of services and moved us along the road to a commercially-based health care provision in Ireland, where what really counts is the size of one&rsquo;s wallet.  Many Clare patients have been diverted to the Mid-West Regional Hospital in Limerick in recent months, where staffing embargoes and increased patient numbers are creating significant difficulties.  I have witnessed at first hand the chaos in our so-called centres of excellence where people are stripped of all dignity and placed on trolleys and chairs for hours and days.  No new facilities or extra patient space has been provided at Limerick Regional Hospital to deal with the additional workload despite all the promises made in this House.  It is even difficult to park a car down there.</P>
        <P>At Ennis General Hospital, I have been outraged at the ongoing situation with regard to CT scanning services.  There has been a stream of conflicting information coming from the HSE concerning this much-needed facility.  Last January, we were told that staff recruitment difficulties were resolved and that operations would be up and running without delay.  Then we learned that services had been suspended again following the departure of a temporary radiol<Col N="650"/>ogist.  The latest news is that this vital service is now at last working again, seven months after closing.  It is vital that this service is developed and opened up to outpatients.</P>
        <P>Some weeks ago, I met with staff working in Ennis General Hospital to brief myself on the current situation in that facility.  The under-investment continues apace, as does the agenda to close services and centralise.  The endoscopy unit promised under the reconfiguration of services has still not been delivered, while the promised geriatric beds are not there either.  The policy continues to be to cut whatever costs money and replace it with nothing.</P>
        <P>I refer again to the roll-out of BreastCheck to County Clare.  I first raised this matter here in May 2009 and since then I have raised it a further eight times.  The latest statement from the HSE is that BreastCheck will be made available via a mobile unit in the grounds of Clare County Council in Ennis this September.  These are more words, however, and there is a sense that we have heard all of this before.  What we need now is action.  The roll-out process should be fast-tracked and prioritised.  The handling of this issue has been nothing short of a scandal.  How can anyone have confidence in our health service when the administrators cannot roll out an essential programme such as BreastCheck on time and efficiently?</P>
        <P>At this juncture, we need an overhaul of the country&rsquo;s health care system.  Fine Gael has such a plan called FairCare, which will fix our broken health care system.  Only then will we be able to adopt 21st century health care, where patients come first and not cost savings, and where everyone can have confidence in their health care system.</P>
        <P>This week, fears were expressed that cardiac services in Ennis General hospital are under threat.  The Minister for Health and Children should attend the House to make a statement on the long-term plans for cardiac services at that hospital.  Yesterday, a very committed consultant, Mr. Terry Hennessy, who is based in Ennis, said he wants to see the services being upgraded there.  Mr. Hennessy rubbished claims that cardiac services were under threat.  Nonetheless, the Minister should make a statement to this House on the matter.</P>
        <P>I welcome the main provisions of this Bill and look forward to the Minister, Deputy Harney, addressing the concerns I have raised.</P>

	<P>Go raibh maith agat.  The Deputy might convey our good wishes to all those little babies whose names have now been registered on the D&aacute;il record.  Well done.  I now call the next speaker, Deputy Niall Blaney, who has 20 minutes in the slot. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallBlaneyIND"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Blaney</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Deputy Carey, I have availed of similar services in Donegal over the last four years.  I had three children delivered in Letterkenny General Hospital.  It is enlightening to hear from Deputy Carey that all of those with whom he is involved have had such good treatment in such restricted financial times.  It is heartening as a Government Member to hear that.  I am delighted to hear it. </P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill, which recognises the professional standards of our nurses and midwives.  I firmly believe that nurses and midwives are the unsung heroes of our health system.  They are professionals that we all encounter at some stage of our lives.</P>
        <P>It is significant that this Bill has been warmly welcomed by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.  It is vital that the public are confident in the way we deliver and administer our health services, ensuring that patient safety is at the top of the agenda.  Confidence in the system must be the cornerstone, both for the nursing and midwifery professions as well as for the general public.</P><Col N="651"/>
        <P>This Bill follows on from regulatory changes introduced for other health professionals in recent years and, therefore, it is appropriate that nurses and midwives are recognised on an equal footing to other health care professionals.</P>
        <P>It has been recognised that the regulatory framework needs to be modernised to include a greater emphasis on patient safety, governance, accountability, openness, fairness, efficiency in disciplinary procedures and assured standards.  This Bill puts public safety and confidence at the heart of all that nurses and midwives do in a statutory manner, whilst also safeguarding the integrity of those professions.</P>
        <P>The current Nurses Act was enacted in 1985 and we have come a long way since then in terms of health care provision.  Our health system has developed further, bringing with it the nurses and midwives who have been ever willing to improve and progress their roles to meet the changing needs of patients.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a new regulatory body, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  The new board will have a lay majority among its board members.  It will consist of 23 members in total, representing all interested parties, including nurses, midwives, educational bodies, members of the public and stakeholders.  It is vital that nurses and midwives are assured that their views and concerns are represented on the board.</P>
        <P>A major element of the board&rsquo;s work will be to administer complaints in conjunction with the fitness to practice committee.  I welcome the fact that fitness to practice inquiries will be held in public in future, unless, on application, the particular circumstances of an individual case require it to be held in private.  This provides for greater transparency for all of those involved.  It is vital that a transparent complaints system is in place for all those who may need it.  Nurses and midwives must have confidence in the complaints system, as must the public to ensure that best practice prevails.</P>
        <P>Constant advances in medicine, surgery and obstetrics are immense, requiring similar advances in the ability and willingness of all those delivering such services.  This Bill will provide for nurses and midwives to maintain their professional competence on an ongoing basis, which is vital both to the service and the confidence of our nurses and midwives.  To ensure this happens, the board will establish a competency scheme to monitor the competence of all nurses and midwives in the State.  Patient care and safety are key to providing their services, and regulation and governance must acknowledge that fact.  This promotes the need for proper regulation and ongoing training among these professionals.</P>
        <P>Nurses and midwives must be assured that their expertise, qualifications and experience are recognised.  I welcome the definite focus on education and training in this regard.  A positive feature of the Bill puts an obligation on employers to facilitate the maintenance of professional competence among nurses and midwives, in particular by providing learning opportunities in the workplace.  We are all aware of the benefit of experience as an aid to education and training, particularly in practical settings such as a hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>This legislation will classify midwives as a separate and distinct profession also, which I believe is appropriate.  The duties carried out by midwives in caring for women before, during and after childbirth require incredible professionalism and skill.  We have an excellent service at Letterkenny General Hospital in my constituency in Donegal.  I commend nursing staff there on their good work. In the past four years I have had an opportunity to experience the service at first hand as my three children were delivered in the hospital.  The service was second to none.  I also welcome the fact that the Bill provides for the establishment of a midwives committee to advise the board on all matters relating to midwifery practices.</P><Col N="652"/>
        <P>I commend the Minister, Deputy Harney, and her Department on a worthwhile Bill.  I understand she engaged in extensive public consultation, with input from all interested parties and stakeholders since 2007.  The Bill will serve to improve the profession and give protection to both the professional and patients.  Nurses and midwives usually encounter patients when they are in a delicate and vulnerable condition and the care provided by those professions leaves an indelible memory.  We have all experienced the wonderful care provided by nurses and midwives.  I commend the Minister on her Trojan efforts in bringing the Bill to the House and ensuring that all interested parties had a worthwhile input.</P>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is my first opportunity to wish the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey, well in his new portfolio.  I have known him for a long time and I am sure he will do a very good job in it.  I wish him the best of luck.  I am delighted he is a member of the Cabinet.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The Nurses and Midwives Bill 2010 repeals the Nurses Act 1985 and provides a modern statutory framework for the regulation of the nursing and midwifery professions.  The primary objective of the Bill is the enhancement and protection of the public in its dealing with nurses and midwives.  It will provide for a modern, efficient, transparent and accountable system for the regulation of the nursing and midwifery professions.</P>
        <P>It is important to have the Bill before the House and to recognise the significant contribution nurses have made to society, especially to many people at a time of illness.  We have heard stories also about midwives dealing with the births of children.  People are dependent at such a vulnerable time.  Many people in this country have trained as nurses.  A total of 89,580 nurses are registered with the board.  The profession has been dominated by women.  Of the total number of nurses, 82,500 are ladies indicating that approximately 7,000 men have taken up the profession.  They are the pillars of society in every country.  It is unfortunate that one has to spend time in a hospital to appreciate the work of nurses.</P>
        <P>It is a caring profession and many nurses are drawn to enter it because they want to make a real difference and to care for and help people.  It is welcome that when young people decide to go into a profession so many take up one that is about helping other people.  It is not only a worthwhile profession; it is a vocation that many young people choose.  In England the young Irish girls who are being trained as nurses in hospitals such as Whipps Cross and many other well known places are spoken of highly in terms of being well trained and articulate.  As a nation we must be proud of them.  One cannot speak highly enough of nurses and their contribution to society.  I have four sisters in the nursing profession and I have seen how dedicated they are to looking after other people.  That is why I welcome the Bill.</P>
        <P>In welcoming the Bill we must deal with the concerns and frustrations nurses encounter in their daily lives.  At a time when it is more and more difficult to finance the needs in the health area, huge misspending of money in the Health Service Executive is evident.  That is a strong statement to make but I do so because there were no cutbacks in management compared to the cutbacks nurses experience on the ground.  Clonmel Hospital in my constituency is subject to the reconfiguration programme of the Minister for Health and Children and the Health Service Executive.  Nurses in that hospital are worried and fearful as they go through the process of reconfiguration.  They see at first hand the input each of them has made into the services in the county.  The committee is reconfiguring the service, which will affect the service and take people&rsquo;s jobs and livelihoods away.  The service is needed and nurses have to wait while management in the Health Service Executive consider leaving the county without it.  It is understandable how 10,000 people congregated in the streets of Clonmel on a cold March <Col N="653"/>day to march behind the nursing profession and the people of the county in order to maintain the wonderful service.</P>
        <P>The existing maternity service has already been reconfigured, as part of it came from Cashel many years ago.  The Health Service Executive is now considering taking the service out of the county.  Are the Minister and the Health Service Executive serious about the proposed closure of one of the finest establishments in this country?  I say that without fear of contradiction.  I visit that hospital on a regular basis and I meet constituents who refer to sick relatives and how well treated they are in the hospital, yet an expert group is considering closing down the hospital service in the county.  People are afraid that will happen but we do not know what will happen.  We are waiting for a committee decision to hear whether it will take part of the services from Clonmel Hospital and put it into Kilkenny or take services from Kilkenny and put them into Waterford.</P>
        <P>A big, new hospital is supposed to be built in Waterford.  I heard the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, say there is not a red cent to build a hospital in any part of the country.  Why are we wasting time with officials looking at projects when there is no money to implement them?  At the same time there is no money to pay nurses to fill positions in maternity hospitals and general hospitals.  I read in the newspaper today that beds are being closed in Clonmel Hospital because there are no nurses or staff to look after people there.  Who is in charge of what is happening in the health service in this country?  Is it the Minister for Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, the Department of Health and Children or the Cabinet?  I wonder who is in charge and is allowing this ridiculous situation continue.  The reconfiguration should stop.  We should stop wasting taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
        <P>I say that sincerely because according to a member of the Cabinet, there is no money to build a big hospital.  Discussions on the amalgamation of services and the construction of bigger facilities are continuing nonetheless.  Have I ever heard anything so ridiculous?  Have I ever had to come to the House to explain something so silly to a Minister?</P>
        <P>I want to make a plea on behalf of my hospital, as Deputy Joe Carey did earlier on behalf of his hospital.  Millions of euro have been invested in the service in south Tipperary.  A High Court agreement is in place.  If my figures are right, over &euro;20 million has been spent across the hospitals in Clonmel and Cashel.  Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Cashel needs to be opened.  The building works that have been ongoing for many years need to be finished.  The nurses in that hospital should be allowed to get on with providing services.  The same thing applies to Clonmel.  The maternity and accident and emergency services in County Tipperary should be retained to reassure people in the county who are worried that their children may have accidents in the middle of the night.</P>
        <P>There is a funny situation in County Tipperary.  If the maternity unit in Clonmel is closed, no Tipperary child will be born in the county.  If there is no hospital where children can be born in the premier county, which is one of the finest and largest counties in Ireland and has a population of 180,000, will we be able to stand over that?  I challenge the Government Deputies who come in here week in, week out, to defend that.</P>
        <P>I support much of what is in this Bill.  We must start by looking after the nurses on the ground.  The nurses in County Tipperary have been providing a wonderful service for many years.  We need to give them a sense of freedom.  As someone who listens to them every day, I know they feel they have been isolated by this Government.  They are not represented on the committee that is supposed to be looking after their future.  What is happening is wrong, unfair and unjust.  The Government has to answer to the people of County Tipperary.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Pat Carey to bring my message about Tipperary to the Cabinet.</P><Col N="654"/>
        <P>I feel strongly about this huge issue.  Regardless of which Government is in power, if it changes direction to do what is being considered in Clonmel I will not stand by it under any circumstances.  Taxpayers&rsquo; money has already been spent and reconfiguration has already taken place.  I am putting up a sign telling the Government to keep its hands off the services in South Tipperary General Hospital.  I mean it.  I want to say it strongly.  As someone who has family members working in the hospital, I know many of the people who have given a commitment to the hospital.  At a time when we are talking about the wastage of money, it is wrong to allow this committee to continue to do what it is doing.</P>
        <P>I am glad to have had an opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  I have made the case for the nurses of Clonmel.  I welcome many aspects of the Nurses and Midwives Bill 2010, which will help to protect the community.  We are all in this together.  Everybody wants to ensure the people get a better service.  They need to be protected.  It is important that we are introducing regulations.  That should be welcomed.  I wanted to make a strong point on behalf of my constituents, including the nurses who are so committed to their jobs.  We need to start by supporting them.  If we make them feel they belong and ensure their work is honoured and recognised, we will have a better nursing profession.  They will know that in the future, they can take out mortgages and send their children to college.  If they are to have secure futures, their jobs are important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about this Bill.  A substantial amount of clarification and explanation is required.  I hope to raise some questions.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, spoke in detail about this Bill recently.  I suppose that gives me some latitude to look at the general position of the HSE and the provision of health care in this State.   I remind Deputy Tom Hayes that the HSE is not responsible for the closure of hospitals throughout the State.  The withdrawal of essential health services across this land is Government policy.  The HSE is used as a mudguard to collect blame.  The reality is that the HSE will do what it is told to do, by and large, by the Minister and in accordance with Government policy.  I need to correct that misnomer at the outset.</P>
        <P>Earlier this afternoon, I was told the hospitals in Wexford, Clonmel and Dundalk will be closed at the end of June, in effect, as no registrars or anaesthetists will be appointed to them.  We already know that the appointment of junior doctors to Louth County Hospital for training purposes will cease on 30 June next.  As a consequence, all acute medical services at the hospital will have to be transferred to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, which is already grossly overcrowded.  This is a specific policy intention of the Government.  There is a shortage of junior doctors at present because the Government made it much more difficult for junior doctors from outside the EU to get positions here.  The Government has refused to recognise or accept the standard examination that is carried out in Britain.  Applicants for junior doctor positions have to deal the significant delays and expenses associated with the similar &mdash; almost identical &mdash; test that applies in this State.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the Government does not want additional junior doctors.  It is much happier to close essential services and to corral health care into a number of bigger hospitals.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, which is such a hospital, is full to capacity.  The hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency unit, which was developed at a cost of &euro;11.5 million, is waiting to be opened.  It cannot open because sufficient staff are not available at present, largely as a result of the cap on recruitment.  In some cases, people have to sit on chairs and trolleys in the existing accident and emergency unit for 36 or 40 hours because they cannot be moved into the new modern facility.</P><Col N="655"/>
        <P>The difficulties that already exist in Drogheda will be substantially compounded by the arrival of significant numbers of acute patients from Louth County Hospital in Dundalk.  The accident and emergency department, the intensive care unit and the male and female medical wards will be transferred from Dundalk to a hospital that is already grossly overcrowded.  Is that good health care management by the Government and the Minister?  I do not think it is.  It is disgraceful.</P>
        <P>The whole situation regarding anaesthetists, registrars and junior doctors needs to be dealt with by the Government as a matter of urgency.  Unfortunately, I do not see any effort on the part of the Government to do so.</P>
        <P>In fairness, it must be acknowledged the run-down of the health service in Louth County Hospital had started before the Government took up office.  It commenced approximately 20 years ago.  In 2001 the children&rsquo;s ward closed, follow by the maternity unit, the obstetrics and gynaecological ward and their services transferred to the Lourdes hospital in Drogheda.</P>
        <P>Women and children first, a bit like the <i>Titanic</i>.  The comparison is apt considering the Government, if it has its way, will sink the essential services for in excess of 100,000 people in the greater Dundalk catchment area.  They will be crowded into the already overcrowded hospital in Drogheda.</P>
        <P>The solution, it was claimed, was there would be a new modern, and state-of-the-art, midwife-led service provided at Louth County Hospital.  Women throughout Britain were meant to be opting for this type of service.  A similar service was located in Bristol which was supposed to be operating successfully.  This was pure bunkum and lies.  We were misled by those statements from the HSE, Health Service Executive, and local politicians both at council and Oireachtas level.  The midwife-led unit never opened.  The unit in Bristol that we were told was all-shining, terrific and modern we then learned had serious problems.</P>
        <P>Women in the Dundalk area now have to decide to travel to the Drogheda maternity unit which has its own problems.  Until recently, that unit&rsquo;s mid-wife complement was grossly understaffed.  The international standard for midwives is 1:25 births.  In Drogheda for a considerable time, it was operating at a complement of 1:48 births, almost double the international standard.  I acknowledge it has begun to come down, an improvement of 1:35 births.  It still, however, is a long way from meeting international standards to which women in the area entitled.  Mothers-to-be in Dundalk have the other option of attending a private practice across the Border.</P>
        <P>These choices are grossly unfair and come down to the nub of the Government&rsquo;s health policy.  It is trying to privatise as much of the health service as it possibly can.  It is trying to shut down public services and cajole patients into private health care.  Its promotion of private health care has already been demonstrated by its huge tax incentives for private hospitals.</P>
        <P>The Americanisation of the Irish health service is well under way.  Up to 50% of the people of this State have opted for private health care because they have no other alternative as proper public health care services are not in place.  This element of public health care provision, a responsibility of this and preceding Governments, is completely ignored.  This is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>If I were in charge of this Government, I would not allow the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, to clean out a toilet in a hospital much less run an entire health service.  She is neither competent in nor cares about dealing with the difficulties faced by the health service.  The Government is happy, due to the politics of the situation, to allow her carry on being Minister to a service that is grossly underfunded and understaffed.  The staff in Louth County Hospital no longer walk but run from bed to bed because of the pressures of understaffing.  It is an indictment of this Government, the other Fianna F&aacute;il-led ones over the past 13 years and their predecessors.</P><Col N="656"/>
        <P>Wexford, Nenagh, Louth, Sligo, Monaghan and Navan hospitals, essential health care services to their localities, will be closed down by Government policy.  Those first affected by these closures will be women, children and older people.  They will now be required to travel ever longer distances to access health care.  This is an indictment of the Government&rsquo;s scandalous and unacceptable health policy.</P>
        <P>Bring on the next general election because I hope the people of this State will give the Government the electoral result it deserves.  Never mind the banking crisis, what is going on in the health service is just as big a scandal.  It is a scandal in the provision of fundamental public services to our society.  This Government does not care about society; it does not have a social conscience.  All it wants to do is bail out its greedy and corrupt banker and speculator friends.</P>
        <P>By this I am not referring to those working in the banks serving members of the public at the front desk.  They are the hard-working but underpaid, doing a decent job.  I am referring to the senior executives in the banking services that are corrupt.</P>
        <P>I am also referring to those the senior people in the HSE, those from a professional medical background, who know what exactly they are doing in their administration and closing down of the services.  Of course, they will be all right because if they ever decide to go back into medicine, there will be a position for them in privatised hospitals.  These very hospitals were incentivised to the tune of 100% by the taxpayer for construction and kit-out costs with a 15% allowance for the first six years and 10% for year seven.</P>
        <P>This specific Government policy does not care about people who cannot afford private health care.  This is a Government that does not care about the sick.  It only cares about the golden circle, evidence of which we see in this Chamber every day when debating these matters.</P>
        <P>When the National Treatment Purchase Fund was introduced some years ago, its purpose we were told was to shorten the lengthy waiting lists for people who needed essential care.  While I support this scheme because it facilitates, say, pensioners&rsquo; hip replacements in the private health sector if they have had to wait over three months, it must be seen that the Government never sought to make proper provision for hip replacements in the first instance.  It has become the standard to funnel these public patients into the private health system at huge costs to the taxpayer when public provision should have been made in the first instance.</P>
        <P>The fact people are willing to pay exorbitantly for private health insurance suggests to me they would be willing to pay a specific additional percentage in taxation that would be ring-fenced for the proper provision of health care.  Is that happening?  No, because the Government wants to Americanise the whole Irish health care system, which is a scandal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have referred to the Louth County Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda both of which are within my constituency but let us consider Monaghan General Hospital for one moment.  It does not have the same catchment area as Dundalk, but does that mean the people of Monaghan are less entitled to health care service?  The hospital has been in place for more than 50 years and has served the people of that area well.  Why is it being closed now?  We are informed it is because of re-configuration.  That represents only a buzz-word to me, learned from public relations people who, in turn, sourced such terms from the beginning of the buzz-word era with the Americans and the Vietnam war.  This might appear to be a lengthy connection but it is a fact.  Re-configuration was a buzz-word introduced to try to bluff people who might believe that such people know what they are talking about when they use such words.  However, they are simply referring to cutting back a service, in this case for the people of Monaghan and its catchment area.  The local hospital has served the people of Monaghan very well for more than 70 years but it is now closed or virtually closed.  There is no acute medicine in place and no accident and emergency department.  Patients from that area are <Col N="657"/>being sent to the Cavan General Hospital at the moment.  The people in the Cavan area might believe that is a great thing and it means their health service is being maintained and functioning but only in the short term.  It is only a matter of time until Cavan General Hospital patients will have to travel the additional journey to the already overcrowded Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  This hospital in turn will be still further overcrowded by the patients from Dundalk, never mind the people from Cavan coming down.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that for the people of Blacklion, Cavan, in the west of that constituency, there is a 100 plus mile journey to their nearest hospital.  This is the result of what is happening in the north east and the people of Cavan need to know as much in advance of the next general election.  Soon, they will be expected to travel.  Let us remember we are discussing people who are ill, who are about to be admitted to hospital, who are sick and who need attention.  The last thing one should do with someone who is unwell is to send them on a 100 plus mile journey to the nearest hospital for acute medical care, but that is exactly what Government policy is forcing the people of Cavan and Monaghan to do.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Louth County Hospital, which is about to close for all intents and purposes.  It will not close completely.  The doors will be open and it will deal with some endoscopies, minor procedures and cuts and bruises but it will deal with nothing serious.  We were promised a minor injuries unit in the Louth County Hospital but I will not hold my breath for that to happen because I do not believe it.  However, if it does take place, no service will be adequate to replace what has been in place for 50 years now, that is, a proper, functioning accident and emergency service.</P>
        <P>The people in Meath, especially in the Navan area, need to know that the services of Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan are already being run down and it will be closed as well.  There is a slow burn in place and those working there have already been put on notice that re-configuration will take place.  The people who use that hospital will have to travel a substantial distance for health care.</P>
        <P>I intend to use my last two minutes to say it is a shame, not only on this Government and its Ministers, but on every Member who votes in favour of the Government.  It is scandalous that, time after time, certain backbenchers get up and walk through the lobbies and vote for this policy which is grinding down our health service.  The Minister for Health and Children is somewhat like an absentee landlord.  She shows up here once in a blue moon but has shown no diligence, interest or enthusiasm for the position she holds.  She should go.  In fact, she should be sacked and put out the door for neglect of the service.  Similarly, the Government should be told to go as well.  I look forward to an early general election to give the people an opportunity to give an answer to this Government once and for all and to say to it &ldquo;No more&rdquo;.  It should turn this policy around to give a proper health care service to everyone in the State not only to the millionaires who can afford it, but to the ordinary people wherever they come from.  People should have reasonable access to a proper health service no matter what the size of their bank account.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  While I have some concerns about the Nurses and Midwives Bill 2010, to which I will refer later in my discussion, in principle, I welcome it.  The Bill serves to enhance the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and to ensure the practice of nursing and midwifery with a level of integrity which, I believe, is already in place but to ensure it continues in future.  The Bill is supposed to provide for a modern, efficient, transparent and accountable system for the regulation of the nurses and midwifery professions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some chance of that.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="658"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is supposed to satisfy the public.  The relevant professionals, all of whom are nurses and midwives, should be appropriately qualified and competent to practise in a safe manner on an ongoing basis.  This is an important principle.</P>
        <P>I refer to an issue I have raised for several years, that is, the need to ensure there is a system of regulation which is accountable for other types of professions.  I refer in particular to the professions of counselling and psychotherapy.  Serious issues arise in respect of dealing with people in very vulnerable conditions but there is no regulation whatsoever in this regard.  I will deal with this matter at greater length later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us compare the approach of the Bill to nursing and midwifery and the total absence of regulation in respect of 12 other areas, which were supposed to be regulated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  Some 12 professions were regulated in that legislation including physiotherapists, welfare officers, and so on.  Since 2005 nothing has been done and not one of these 12 professions have been regulated.  I have campaigned to add the two areas to which I have referred, namely, psychotherapy and counselling, but I am informed the other 12 professions must be regulated before it would be possible to add these two professions to the regulatory framework about which I am specifically concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have seen at first hand the damage that can be done by untrained people dealing with vulnerable cases.  There is a course which takes place over eight weekends to train someone to deal with eating disorder difficulties.  Eating disorders are among the more difficult areas of psychiatric difficulty.  They involve psychiatric, emotional and physical conditions.  A complex combination is involved.  It is totally unacceptable for someone to be qualified to deal with this after eight weekends.  I refer to a situation whereby after 90 hours someone can obtain an advanced diploma in suicide treatment.  Such people can deal with those who are suicidal and those bereaved as a result of suicide.  These people are going into very delicate areas and this can cause difficulties.  I have raised this matter with the Minister, who fully accepts the situation should be dealt with, but it will not be dealt with until the 12 other professions are dealt with in the 2005 legislation.  However, none of these have been addressed yet.  At this rate, none of us will be in the House by the time some regulation is in place in this area.</P>
        <P>I refer to the controls in this Bill.  Certain training elements are required for psychotherapy and counsellors.  Of the professions involved in that area, 22 have come together to recommend training to ensure competency, but that does not stop anyone putting a plaque on the wall and charging &euro;80 an hour for counselling and psychotherapy.</P>
        <P>The Bill repeals the Act of 1985 and puts in place a new framework in respect of nurses and midwives, the body to be known as Bord Altranais agus Cn&aacute;imhseachais na h&Eacute;ireann, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  It recognises midwifery as a separate and distinct profession and provides for the clinical supervision of midwives, who must have adequate indemnity insurance.  I am sure the indemnity requirement already exists but it is important to regulate it.  The Bill also ensures a non-nursing midwifery majority on the board and on the fitness to practise committee.  There is considerable concern about the fact that there will be a non-nursing majority on the board, and I will deal with this aspect later.</P>
        <P>The Bill will establish an improved investigation mechanism for complaints about nurses and midwives, including the establishment of an assessment committee prior to fitness to practise investigations, and the appointment of investigators to facilitate such preliminary investigations.</P>
        <P>Surely the area of counselling and psychotherapy should be covered by the fitness to practise element of the Bill.  I know of people who have been seriously damaged by unregulated counsellors and therapists.  The principle should apply to the area I raised earlier.  The Bill includes a prohibition on unregistered nurses and midwives engaging in the practice of nursing and mid<Col N="659"/>wifery.  That is as it should be.  We must ensure the proper training of nurses.  The training of nurses has changed greatly over the years.</P>
        <P>I am not convinced the new system is an advance on the old.  My own wife was trained under the old system and my mother was trained as a psychiatric nurse in the 1940s.  The practical training they received stood to their human approach to the patient in all aspects of  nursing, whether in the community or in hospitals.  The more academic approach loses much of that.  I do not say the content of the modern academic training is questionable.  It is acceptable.  However, the marrying of academic study with experience on the wards during a period of training inculcated in nurses an understanding that there was more to nursing than passing a final examination and getting a qualification.  There was a patient-nurse relationship aspect to nursing, which is lacking in the modern approach.</P>
        <P>The Bill also deals with the registration of nurses and midwives, of candidates and of advanced nurse and midwife practitioners&rsquo; posts.  There will be a new statutory framework for the maintenance of professional competence of registered nurses and midwives.  The Bill also deals with the dissolution of the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery and the transfer of its staff, assets and liabilities to the board.  That is a practical aspect of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the legislation is the protection of the public.  Key aspects of this relate to fitness to practise, competency and a non-professional majority on the board.  In this regard, I raise the following points.  The Bill seeks to introduce what is regarded as a two-part fitness to practise structure, which would bring the Nurses and Midwives Bill in line with the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  This structure provides for the establishment of the preliminary proceedings committee to give initial consideration to complaints and an internal fitness to practise committee to conduct inquiries.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance was established by the Minister to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that the quality and safety of patient care is paramount within the health care system.  The Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance advocates the separation of fitness to practise from the regulatory function.  Under these proposals, the board will still be responsible for the preliminary investigation and if it is decided that there is a case to answer, the chief executive will present the facts of the case to the fitness to practise committee, which would operate outside the board.  According to the regulatory impact assessment, &ldquo;There is a lot of merit in what is proposed by the commission.  However, the detail of how it would operate is not clear and it will be the work of the sub-group to examine and make proposals as to how this might be achieved&rdquo;.  The Minister, in concluding the debate, might comment on why she has not accepted the recommendations of her own commission on patient safety and quality assurance and why the proposal I refer to has not been developed in the Bill, but left to a sub-group, who will examine it and make proposals as to how the situation might be dealt with.  While the Bill is going through the Houses, there is an opportunity for the implementation strategy group to make recommendations in this regard.</P>
        <P>The proposed fitness to practise model is based on the model adopted by the Medical Council.  It is my understand that the Medical Council has sought amendments to the new legislation, based upon its experience through its practice as a medical council.  Can the Minister confirm if this is the case? If it is, what amendments has the Medical Council sought, as the Nurses and Midwives Bill will, otherwise, repeat mistakes already made?  There is an indication that the medical council is concerned that the difficulties it identified will be repeated.  The difficulties have already been experienced in the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill, before even one of the 12 professions has been regulated.  The Minister has written to me on <Col N="660"/>this matter and informed me that she must bring forward a Bill to correct difficulties experienced in that Bill.  It was passed in 2005 but nothing has been affected by it yet.</P>
        <P>The current board consists of 29 members, 17 of whom are elected by nurses and 12 appointed by the Minister for Health and Children.  The new board will have 23 members, 15 of whom will be appointed by the Minister and eight elected by the professionals.  There is concern at this arrangement.</P>
      
        <P>The eight members of the new board elected by professionals are to include two nurses, one from general nursing and one from children&rsquo;s nursing, of whom at least one must be in clinical practice; two nurses, one from psychiatric nursing and one from intellectual disability nursing, of whom at least one must be in clinical practice; one midwife and one public health nurse, of whom at least one must be in clinical practice; one nurse or midwife engaged in education; and one older persons&rsquo; nurse.</P>
        <P>My party met the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, which has voiced serious concerns about the proposed structure of the board and the adequacy of the representation of nurses and midwives thereon.  It claims there is no way the work of midwives can be adequately represented or safeguarded with only one midwife on a board of 23.  The same applies to the other strands of nursing.  The board of 23 must be compared with a 25-member board for the Medical Council, which looks after 7,000 medical practitioners.  The Allied Health Professional Council, which has a board of 21, looks after 5,500 to 6,000 allied health professionals.</P>
        <P>The proposed membership does not provide adequate recognition of differing numbers within each area of nursing and midwifery.  For example, there is one general nurse engaged in clinical practice who will represent more than 25,000 practising general nurses while one public health nurse will represent 1,700 public health nurses.  Perhaps the Minister of State will outline the rationale that applied when this decision was made and whether she believes the approach she is taking adequately represents and reflects the discipline of nursing.</P>
        <P>Section 25 allows for the payment of allowances to members of the board or committees.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify the numbers of people who will be eligible for such allowances.</P>
        <P>Section 46 establishes what is referred to as a &ldquo;candidate register&rdquo;.  This means undergraduates will have to register with the new board and pay a fee for the privilege.  Will the Minister of State explain the purpose of this new register and its benefit to the board other than its being a crude money-making exercise?  Candidates are not independent professionals but are supervised at all times.  It is not clear why they must register in the way proposed.</P>
        <P>Section 46 establishes what is referred to as an advanced nurse practitioner/advanced midwife practitioner, ANP-AMP, post register.  This post register will contain the names and details of advanced nurse practitioners&rsquo; posts and advanced midwife practitioners&rsquo; posts, and any other information required by rules.  This register applies only where there is a post.  If an advanced nurse practitioner wanted to move to a different hospital with no such post, he or she would not be not registered.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will explain the purpose of this register?  Is it to prevent people from developing services where the HSE and Minister do not want them?  If one is off the register for a number of years, can one get back onto it?  Many nurses, who are predominantly female, decide to leave nursing for a period to rear a family and then return to nursing.  Many of my family friends have done so.  No stipulation exists in the Bill for any other registered professional and his or her registration.  The proposed register will, by default but perhaps not by design, prohibit the development of the profession.</P><Col N="661"/>
        <P>The membership of five proposed for the statutory midwifery committee is hopelessly inadequate and will not ensure that the many areas of midwifery are represented, even through nomination, in the workings of the midwifery committee.  The current legislation, as interpreted by the board, does not allow it to comment on the environment within which nurses practise.</P>
        <P>Section 9 sets out the functions of the board.  This section does not give the board a role to advise service providers regarding staff shortages, physical environment, poor quality or unsafe conditions.  Every action the board takes must be carried out with the agreement of the Minister.  Therefore, it is not acting independently in the interest of the public.  It acts on the instructions of the Minister.  As Members have stated, ministerial instructions do not, at all times, represent the best interest of the public.  The Minister nominates the president, who does not have to be a nurse.</P>
        <P>The chief executive officer of the new board will not be permitted to make any statements that differ, contradict or oppose ministerial and Government policy.  A similar restriction does not apply to the chief executive officer of the Medical Council or the chief executive officer of the Allied Health Professional Council.  Why is the chief executive officer of the proposed board being gagged?  Surely it is in the interest of transparency that the chief executive officer be in a position to ensure the public interest is protected where he or she is extremely concerned about a certain development and is not being responded to by the system, Minister or the dysfunctional HSE.</P>
        <P>The regulatory body should be allowed to seek to meet the service provider, advise it regarding a given matter and ask if anything can be done.  Provision in this regard should be included in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on why the board does not have authority to do as I propose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other speakers, I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is important and it has a regulatory function.  It introduces new requirements in certain areas and replaces others.  We should always welcome improvements but we are not so certain that all the provisions in this Bill are improvements.  As we have come to recognise, very often the legislation we pass worsens a problem in need of remedy.  I am not so certain that problems will not arise on foot of this Bill.</P>
        <P>The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The purpose of the Bill is to enhance the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and to ensure the integrity of the practice of nursing and midwifery.  It will provide for a modern, efficient, transparent and accountable system for the regulation of the nursing and midwifery professions, which will satisfy the public and these professions that all nurses and midwives are appropriately qualified and competent to practice in a safe manner on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Would it not be great if this applied to the entire health service?  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle agrees with me, although he cannot get up and applaud.  It would be very reassuring to the public if it did apply to the health service as a whole.</P>
        <P>The Bill allows for the protection of and provision of information to the public.  It is to ensure the highest standards will apply and that there will be a right of reply and access.  This is only proper but I hope the rest of the system does not strangle the intentions of the Bill and create something we did not intend to create in the first place.</P>
        <P>The Bill, according to the explanatory memorandum, makes provision for &ldquo;a regulatory body to be known as Bord Altranais or the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland and an explicit statement that it performs its functions in the public interest&rdquo;.  That is laudable and I fully <Col N="662"/>support the concept.  Another element of the Bill, according to the explanatory memorandum is, &ldquo;The recognition of midwifery as a separate and distinct profession.  Provides for clinical supervision of midwives who must have adequate indemnity insurance.&rdquo;  I agree with that.  It is important that midwifery be recognised as a separate and distinct profession and that the highest possible standards prevail.</P>
        <P>In doing so, we must not create another tier of management and bureaucracy that could impede the way the profession operates or the service the patient expects.  That could happen in a number of ways.  The necessity for indemnity is increasing and obvious demands occur on a regular basis.  We have witnessed numerous instances of this and I am not sure the supervisory structure is in accordance with what might be in the best interest of either the profession or the patient.  How often have we heard of court cases in which it was suggested that procedures were not followed or interventions and decisions were not taken when they should have been?  While the purpose of the legislation is to streamline procedures and to make sure everything works in a co-ordinated fashion, I can envisage scenarios in the future where a decision was not made because the person in charge is not fully in control or does not have the latitude required to take the decision or has thrust upon him or her additional responsibilities, which could, in turn, jeopardise their judgment and career or somebody&rsquo;s health.</P>
        <P>The provision of a stronger governance and accountability structure for the board is also laudable and I fully support that.  However, based on our experiences in recent years, when boards of all shapes and sizes have been formed in the health and financial sectors, the reverse has been the case.  Everybody ducks and dives and runs for cover while getting away from responsibility.  They do not come up with reports or answer as they should, they are not transparent or accountable and they do everything in their power to ensure their own base is covered and to hell with everybody else.  This is a serious issue and many Members, including myself, have raised this previously.</P>
        <P>The legislation concerns a vital element of the health service where a decision taken or not taken, a question answered or not answered or a person accepting or unwilling to accept responsibility in the chain of command can have widespread implications for everybody involved, including the lives of patients.  While I fully support the concept of accountability and governance, I have my doubts, like many Members who have commented on this subject, about whether it will come to pass on the basis of long years of experience.  I spent a number of years on a health board, as did the Ceann Comhairle.  My only knowledge of this area is based on my experience on the health board and in dealing with constituents.  However, as elected representatives, we need to keep this interaction in mind at all times.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the prohibition on unregistered nurses and midwives engaging in the practice of nursing and midwifery.  I thought that was a given.  If I were representing a person who needed services or I received a query from a constituent in this regard, I would like to think that was the case.  Will the Minister of State clarify the instances in which the prohibition was required?  That would be helpful.</P>
        <P>The approval of programmes of education and further education necessary for the purposes of registration is an excellent provision and a similar provision applies in other areas.  It is important in the medical profession in general that there be ongoing training to ensure awareness among medical professionals about modern practices and developments, to make sure the highest standards of safety apply and to ensure full information is available to those working in the sector at all times.  It is of major importance and I strongly support the provision as well as that relating to advanced nurse and midwife practitioner positions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Responsibility and decisions are important and sensitive issues in this area.  I pay tribute to the nurses and midwives who over the years have given tremendous service throughout the State, well beyond the call of duty in most cases.  They have rarely received the recognition they deserve over the past 70 years, particularly in remote parts of the country where they had to travel long distances in inclement conditions while in receipt of low pay.  Ongoing education, upgrading of skills, awareness of new and emerging practices and the continued insistence that health and safety requirements are maintained must be ensured for the benefit of all.</P>
        <P>Reference is made to the specification of standards of practice for registered nurses and midwives and guidance on all matters related to professional conduct and ethics.  While there has been much debate about conduct and ethics generally, nurses and midwives have rarely been mentioned but they deserve to be mentioned.  People depend on the professional opinion of the person with whom they are dealing and they need to have absolute confidence in that person.  If he or she is adequately qualified and deserves to be registered, the public can have every confidence in the services, which is important.  Unfortunately, there have been a number of cases in other branches of the health services where the reverse was the case.  I am not aware of any such breach in the midwifery area but the degree to which there was a breakdown in the relationship between the patient and the practitioner at senior level is, to say the least, appalling.  I do not wish to go into the details of the original cases, of which the Ceann Comhairle is also aware.  When members of the public put themselves in the hands of the medical professional, at whatever level, they are vulnerable and are entirely dependent on the judgment, ethics and conduct of the person in whose hands they have placed themselves.  I must say &mdash; it has often been spoken of in this House &mdash; there were many breaches in which that confidence was seriously eroded at very senior levels, which is regrettable.  I hope the provision is not necessary in this instance.  I know, from my own knowledge, it generally was not in any event.  However, there will be variations in the degree to which individuals apply themselves to the task and devote themselves to their vocation.  Nevertheless, it behoves us all to recognise that whenever we put in place in the health services a person or persons who have particular responsibilities and obligations and who, for one reason or another do not observe these or recognise the pivotal role they play, this can have a major and negative impact, not only on an individual patient but in terms of the erosion of public confidence in what is a vital service.  I cannot overemphasise this.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note the obligation on employers to facilitate the maintenance of the professional competence of nurses and midwives, in particular by providing learning opportunities in the workplace.  It is important that a work situation should not exist whereby it becomes impossible for the nurse or midwife to avail of an opportunity for ongoing improvement and training.  The argument may be advanced that it is understood that such an opportunity would exist in any event but it may be given in the spirit but not in the letter of the <Col N="664"/>provision.  A situation could arise whereby the pressure of work would be so great that it would be impossible to avail of such opportunities for ongoing training.</P>
        <P>It is stated that fitness to practise inquiries will generally be held in public but a decision may be made by the board to hold some or all of the inquiry in private depending on the circumstances.  That is fair enough although I am not much in favour of inquiries being held in private.  If an issue needs to be dealt with that may have a public interest dimension or that may have an impact on services of which the public may have to avail, where at all possible such hearings should be held in public.  Much can be learned from that process.  I had wished to comment on a few other matters but in the spirit of co-operation, I will conclude at this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Durkan.  I am glad to note that there seems to be a broad welcome for the Bill and agreement that we should update and enhance the regulatory and governance framework for nurses and midwives.  I will briefly address some of the significant issues raised: </P>
        <P Just="Left">First, I assure the House that  the board will have a minimum of two midwife members. One of these will be elected by the professions and one will be appointed from the third-level education sector.  In addition, there is a potential for a further two board members to be midwives.  The elected member who is engaged in the education of nurses and midwives could be a midwife and a director of nursing or midwifery member could also be a midwife.  I am committed to a non-nursing midwifery majority on the board and I am sure my colleagues agree with this.  It is also vital that the composition of Bord Altranais agus Cn&aacute;imhseachais reflects the wide ranges of skills both of nurses and midwives and of other stakeholders including the Medical Council, HIQA, the HSE and the education sector.  At the same time, the board must reflect the principles of good governance which I believe are better served through a reduction in the size of board memberships.</P>
        <P>A number of the speakers addressed the issue of the proposed reduced membership of the board and the ratio of nurse-midwife board members to the number of nurses or midwives on each division of the register.  Board size is not related to a ratio of the number of members from the professions.  What is required is a board membership which will provide for good governance.</P>
        <P>As the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, stated in the House when she proposed this Bill, a reduction in the size of the board will not impact negatively on the performance of its functions, many of which will be carried out by committees.  Non-board members can be members of a committee and this will allow for committees to include individuals with relevant expertise and experience to undertake the functions assigned to them.  Some Deputies expressed concern that the Minister for Health and Children can appoint the president of the board and that it is not essential that the president be a nurse or midwife.  I would like to clarify and emphasise that this only applies in the case of the person to be the first president of the board.</P>
        <P>There is no intention to compromise the independence of the board.  Rather, the intention here is to allow the Minister to select a member of the board who is considered to have the necessary knowledge and experience to lead the new board in its first years.  I would emphasise that the Bill provides that all subsequent board presidents must be elected by the board from its nurse or midwife membership.  This is provided for in the Schedule, paragraph 13.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have already addressed the issue of the midwife membership of the board.  I should now like to deal with the composition of the midwives&rsquo; committee where Deputies are concerned about the size of the committee and its ability to adequately represent all areas of midwifery practice.  This committee will consist of a minimum of five members,and it will be open to the board to select its members.  There is no maximum membership laid down.  At least three <Col N="665"/>members will be registered midwives &mdash; one of whom must be one of the midwife members of the board.  As committee members do not have to be board members, there will be flexibility to ensure that committees such as the midwives&rsquo; committee, as well as the preliminary proceedings committee and the fitness to practise committee have adequate knowledge and experience to perform their functions.</P>
        <P>Some Deputies asked for clarification on the registration of advanced practice posts.  Advanced practitioner posts are developed in response to patient needs and healthcare service requirements and have been shown to be very effective in certain situations.  Before the creation of a post the HSE or a service provider must determine the service need and put in place appropriate structures and procedures for the post to be registered.  The competencies and skills required for the advanced midwife practitioner or advanced nurse practitioner differ, depending on the specific requirements of each advanced practise post.</P>
        <P>To guarantee the required structures and governance, skills and competencies, registration as an advanced nurse practitioner or an advanced midwife practitioner is dependent on employment or an offer of employment in a registered advanced practice post.  This ensures that the public is protected by guaranteeing that advanced nurse practitioners and advanced midwife practitioners are only those who meet the standards and requirements for advanced practice and have the skills and competencies necessary for the post they are working in, and that the required structures and governance procedures are in place to enable them to carry out their duties in that post.</P>
        <P>The Bill will not limit the development of the professions or the expansion of advanced practise unnecessarily.  It will, however, ensure that service need for advanced practice is clearly defined.  Any service provider, including the HSE, can identify the service need and can apply to have an advanced practise post registered, and it will be so registered if it meets the standards and criteria set by the board.</P>
        <P>Deputies Reilly and Neville made reference to the recommendation contained in the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance in relation to fitness to practise provisions and asked why we did not opt for the separation of fitness to practise from the regulatory function. This was, in fact, answered in the regulatory impact analysis as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" FLI="0">. . .the detail of how it would operate is not clear and it will be the work of the sub-group to examine and make proposals as to how this might be achieved.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">As it may be some time before the implementation steering group is in a position to make recommendations it is proposed that the Nurses and Midwives Bill should proceed in line with the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and can be amended if necessary in the future like for all other regulated health professions.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As the Minister has regularly stated, this legislation is aligned with the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and has been examined in detail and adjusted where necessary.  The Minister has taken into consideration the experiences of other regulatory bodies and the legislation pertaining to them.</P>
        <P>Deputies have raised the issue of possible amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act and the impact these would have on the legislation currently before the Houses.  I assure the Deputies that proposed amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act were examined with regard to the Nurses and Midwives Bill to ensure that the relevant issues were addressed.</P>
        <P>Several Deputies suggested that the board should be assigned a role as a conduit for the concerns of nurses and midwives regarding the health services.  The board is a regulatory body for nurses and midwives; however, it can refer matters to other bodies, such as the HSE&rsquo;s <Col N="666"/>complaints procedure, HIQA, or other regulatory bodies.  As the Deputies are aware, HIQA is responsible for setting standards in the public health services and for monitoring compliance with those standards.</P>
        <P>These issues and others will be discussed in greater detail during the forthcoming Committee Stage and in the passage of the Bill through its remaining Stages in the Oireachtas.  I welcome this debate.  The views articulated reflect the widespread interest in this Bill, in the modern and robust regulation of nursing and midwifery, and in ensuring full public confidence in these professions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P><Col N="667"/>
        <P Just="Left">When the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2009 was debated in the House in December 2009 to consider whether to bring the authority within the audit remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General, to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to undertake special reports into the authority&rsquo;s operations, and to require its CEO to come before the Committee of Public Accounts to report on the authority&rsquo;s accounts or any special report undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General, I indicated that I would keep the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in auditing the authority under review, pending consideration of the findings and recommendations of the corporate governance reviews being undertaken by the authority.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the need for proper adherence to due process and fair procedures, I requested the authority to carry out a consultation process with current and former staff and board members to afford them an opportunity to consider and make submissions on the reports involved &mdash; that is, the independent Brassil and King reports commissioned by the authority into its planning and financial functions &mdash; together with an overview report prepared by the authority&rsquo;s executive board.  Following completion of this third-party consultation process, the authority provided the finalised consultancy reports to me on 23 April, while some further revisions to the executive board&rsquo;s report were communicated to me by the authority on 24 May.  I have considered the reports&rsquo; contents and have also submitted them to the Government.  In line with my clearly articulated commitment that these reports would, subject to legal advice, be made publicly available, I published the three reports yesterday and arranged for copies to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>Arising from the comprehensive analysis and conclusions of the review, and acknowledging the view of the authority&rsquo;s board that a further investigation would be required to deal with certain matters, I announced yesterday that the Government had decided to bring the authority within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This means the DDDA will become subject to Comptroller and Auditor General audit and may also be subject to the preparation of specific reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the efficient use of resources and value for money.</P>
        <P>With regard to the matter of certain files and other documentation relating to the purchase of the Irish Glass Bottle site not being properly kept or available within the authority, this is, of course, a serious issue.  While I acknowledge that the authority has already implemented many of the corporate governance review recommendations on the keeping of files and records, it is important that the authority addresses any gaps or omissions in its records, and I am confident that it will continue to work urgently to achieve this to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s change of mind in extending the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate matters relating to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  I ask the Minister to indicate whether he has been in contact with the Comptroller and Auditor General and whether he is satisfied that he is in a position, based on a statutory instrument, to carry out the type of root-and-branch investigation that is essential for us to get to the root of the problems that exist in the DDDA and the financial ruin that has been the result.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister satisfied that sufficient information has been brought to his attention to warrant this change of mind?  Will he comment on the expressed view of the chairman of the DDDA that there is no need to investigate the financial aspects of what went on at board level?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have discussed this matter with the Attorney General, who has advised that the authority can be brought within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General by means of an order to be made by the Minister for Finance.  This will move the <Col N="668"/>authority from the second to the first Schedule of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, alongside the other State bodies that are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is a matter for the Minister for Finance to consider and decide on the timing of any such order.  Thereafter, the nature and timing of action by the Comptroller and Auditor General will clearly be a matter for him to determine, having regard to his constitutionally independent role.  It is important to emphasise that the Comptroller and Auditor General is an independent office holder, as ought to be the case.  It is up to the Committee of Public Accounts to decide how it will use any such report.</P>
        <P>There has been no change of mind.  I made it clear in the reply to my question that I was at all times keeping this matter under review.  Having considered the reports &mdash; it must be remembered that I specifically commissioned these reports from the DDDA &mdash; I thought it appropriate that the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General be widened to consider these matters.  I am glad to hear the Deputy has welcomed the decision.  There are times when a Minister actually follows through on a course of action and, when it is the right course of action, it is only right that it be welcomed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will call Deputy Tuffy in a second, but I wish to allow Deputy Hogan to follow through on his question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously I welcome the decision made by the Minister to expand the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General to include the DDDA, as was provided for in a Bill from Fine Gael that he himself voted down last December.  I am not a total hypocrite, as some other people might be.</P>
        <P>On 22 December 2009, the Minister wrote to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts to explain how he could not, arising from a Supreme Court case, implement any statutory instrument or ministerial order but would require primary legislation to implement this function.  What I do not want to see happening, now that we have decided to go down the proper road, is for the Comptroller and Auditor General to be frustrated in carrying out a proper investigation without primary legislation.  Will the Minister be in contact with the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Minister for Finance to have this order put in place as quickly as possible?</P>
        <P>What other reports has the Minister sought?  In particular, in August 2009 he sought a report from the chairman of the DDDA, Professor Brennan, on corporate governance issues and board matters.  This was expected to be completed by October 2009.  Did he receive that report, and will he be publishing it?</P>
        <P>What is the status of the Moylan report, which the Minister also commissioned?  When will that be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, we had the Brassil report and the King report, the former dealing with planning issues and the latter with financial accountability and corporate governance.  The Deputy also referred to the Moylan report.  That is an internal report which was forwarded to my Department as a matter of courtesy.  I indicated yesterday when I was questioned by RTE that I have no difficulty with that report also being made public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the report on corporate governance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I already referred to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>My question relates to the advice the Minister says he received from the Attorney General that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority could be brought <Col N="669"/>under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General by way of ministerial order.  However, the Minister wrote to Deputy Allen, Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, last September indicating that amendment of primary legislation is a matter for the D&aacute;il and that amending legislation was required in this instance.  The Minister for Finance had already written to Deputy Allen in July 2009 to state that since 2005, the powers under section 21 of the 1993 Act to amend the Schedules to that Act had not been available to the Minister.  He explained that this arose from a Supreme Court judgment which found that delegated legislation cannot make, repeal or amend any law and to the extent that the parent Act purports to confer such a power, it will be invalid having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.  That statement is black and white and there was no qualification of it by the Minister for Finance or by the Minister, Deputy Gormley&rsquo;s, subsequent letter.</P>
        <P>There are other issues that arise in terms of the ability of the Comptroller and Auditor General to require that special reports are carried out, as the Minister mentioned earlier.  If the Minister were to introduce legislation &mdash; which, according to him and to the Minister for Finance less than a year ago, is the correct way to proceed &mdash; that legislation would have to do much more than merely bring the DDDA within the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If the DDDA is merely added to the Schedule of the existing Act, the Comptroller and Auditor General will only be able to look at the DDDA into the future; he will not be able to examine retrospectively past decisions of the authority.  That is the legal advice received by the Labour Party.  In the case of the DIRT inquiry, for example, it was necessary to ensure the legislation enabled the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts to examine the banks&rsquo; past treatment of bogus non-resident accounts.  The same must apply to the DDDA if precedent is anything to go by.  Does the Minister have any advice in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the advice I have received from the Attorney General and it would not make sense if it were so.  I have been informed that the remit is to be extended so that the Comptroller and Auditor General can look at the issues that were raised in the two reports.  I have already outlined the advice we received from the Attorney General, namely, that the authority can be brought within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General and that the order to that effect can be made by the Minister for Finance.  It is for the latter to decide when that will be done but I hope it will be soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>We are seeing a total turnaround by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and the Minister for Finance.  In September 2009, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, indicated that legislation would be required and that a ministerial order would not be sufficient.  Last July, the Minister for Finance said that amending legislation would be required.  In the case of the DIRT inquiry, special legislation was required so that the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General could review past decisions.  What advice did the Minister receive last September and on what advice was the Minister for Finance acting when he wrote to Deputy Allen in July 2009?  Is it different advice from what the Minister received yesterday?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have met briefly with the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and he welcomed my decision on this matter.  As the Minister with responsibility for the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, I am most anxious that we have total openness and transparency in these matters.  The DDDA is getting on with the important work it is doing and has made a major contribution to the development of this city.  It is important that we draw a line under these issues and the best way to do that is by ensuring there is openness and transparency.  I will not be wanting in this regard and anything that is required for such an investigation will be given.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="670"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow a brief supplementary question from each Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>We would have been further on if the Minister had agreed to go down this road in December.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows the reason I did not; I had not received the reports at that time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister certainly was not given good advice if the letter to which Deputy Tuffy and I referred is an indication.  Now he tells us he has received different advice.  We are not making this up as we go along; we have been consistent on this issue.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister indicate whether he received a response to his Department&rsquo;s letter in August 2009 to Professor Niamh Brennan, chairperson of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, on corporate governance matters and board matters?  That response was to be received in October 2009 &mdash; if it was received, what was its import?  When will the Minister publish the Moylan report?  Has he sought a report at any stage from the departmental representative on the board of the DDDA about what was going on there?  What is the estimated taxpayers&rsquo; liability arising from this irresponsible mess and the decisions that were made over the years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, I have spoken to the departmental representatives on the board of the DDDA.  I already answered the Deputy&rsquo;s question about the Moylan report.  I have no difficulty at all in publishing that report, which was sent to me as a matter of courtesy.  It is the property of the DDDA but, as I said, I am in favour of its publication.  However, these reports have been cited in newspaper articles as offering explosive information.  I said previously that this is not the case and I was proved right in that regard.  On the question of liability, the chairperson spoke yesterday at length about this.  The loans have been taken into NAMA and the authority has been asked to produce a business plan by the end of July.  It is only after rigorous examination and total engagement with NAMA that we will know what is the outstanding liability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer again to the use of a ministerial order to bring the authority within the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If we are going to do this, it must be done right.  Will the Minister consider publishing the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice, setting out why the latter considers that only a ministerial order is required, presumably in contradiction to the advice the Minister must have received at the time he and the Minister for Finance wrote to Deputy Allen to indicate that such an order would not be sufficient?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not publish advice from the Attorney General but I have received that advice and discussed it with him.  I assume the Deputy is pleased with the outcome and that the issue is now being advanced.  I have not yet had the opportunity to talk directly to the Minister for Finance about this but, as I said, I hope we can make progress as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>In April 2010, my Department advised housing authorities of revised arrangements for the funding of land used for social housing and sought information from them on local authority residential land holdings for the purpose of ensuring the optimal use of the lands in question.</P>
        <P>Where loans are due to mature before the end of 2010 and where it is considered that the land involved is unlikely to be developed in the short to medium term, authorities have been given the option to apply to my Department to recoup the cost of outstanding loans on the land.  Subject to available funding my Department may pay off the costs of the land and transfer ownership to a central agency.  Functions in relation to the transfer of land in these particular circumstances will initially be undertaken by the National Building Agency.  Some land banks may continue to be available for social housing if housing projects are advanced by authorities under the social housing investment programme, while others may be made available for alternative use, including non-housing and community infrastructure purposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will primary legislation be required to achieve the objective the Minister of State set out?  I suspect it will in regard to merging some of the agencies.  How soon can we expect to see that legislation?  What will be the exposure of the Exchequer to further land loans or has the Minister carried out an inventory of what he expects to transfer from local authorities to NAMA through this agency?  Will an opportunity arise from this decision to generate internal capital receipts in local authorities which are starved of finance currently for essential work to achieve objectives on housing, decisions on waste water and implementation of those programmes?  Does the Minister envisage that we will be able to free up some moneys in each local authority to achieve other objectives arising from this decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has put three questions.  First, legislation is not necessary in the short term.  The people in the Housing Finance Agency will act on behalf of the Government with a special agency property company but legislation will be needed.  We have not decided on the precise form of the legislation as to whether it will be a separate Bill or part of another Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is not a cost involved.  It will be a transfer of public properties and loans from one area &mdash; namely, the local authority &mdash; to the central agency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the Deputy&rsquo;s third question about internal receipts, if lands are not developed local authorities must continue to meet the loan charges.  If they transfer lands whose loans are due in 2010 we will meet the loan charge at that time.  They will be in a position to recoup at that time whereas they would not be in a position to recoup until they developed under the circumstances of the original loan they got from the HFA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister carried out any inventory of the lands involved?  What quantity of lands are we talking about?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not know the amount of lands that will be transferred because it is a voluntary transfer from the local authorities.  I can give the Deputy the figure for the amount of land currently owned by local authorities, which is approximately &euro;650 million nationally.  Some local authorities may decide to transfer loans to the central agency.  We are compiling that.  We gave a date of the end of April to have their requests submitted.  Some are still in discussions with our Department and we have not compiled the amount but I hope to have that information some time in the near future.</P>

	<P>As outlined in the reply to Question No. 4 of 22 April, my Department is progressing a range of actions, with the co-operation of local authorities and other key stakeholders, to address the issue of unfinished or unoccupied estates.  These actions include in the first instance an accurate quantification, classification and mapping of the various types of unfinished or unoccupied estates on a county by county basis to understand the scale and distribution of the problem.  Following completion of a pilot exercise with one local authority, a comprehensive national inventory is now under way and should be completed in the middle of the year.</P>
        <P>My Department is also preparing a best practice policy manual which aims to identify the necessary responses to ensure satisfactory outcomes in tackling issues on specific sites in a co-ordinated and proactive manner.  The responses will require a range of interventions across a number of disciplines &mdash; there are issues of public safety, the provision of bonds and securities, environmental protection, building control and estate management.</P>
        <P>There is a legal responsibility on developers and site owners to ensure their sites are left in a safe and secure condition.  Local authorities are prioritising action to ensure these obligations are discharged and that sites within their areas are properly secured from public access and, where necessary, are made structurally sound.  In this regard, existing legislation such as the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and the Litter Acts 1997 to 2003, along with planning legislation, can be and is being used to ensure developers and the owners of sites engage with local authorities in addressing specific difficulties.  My Department will also keep the need for further legislative reforms to assist local authorities on this issue under review.</P>

	<P>A question, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Many home owners are currently in negative equity and they have been badly let down by the system.</P>
        <P>What is the up to date position on the pilot project in Laois?  Does the Minister of State have anything new to report since last month?  Does the Minister expect that by the end of next month he will have a definitive list of all the unfinished housing estates throughout the country?  Will those be listed on the Department&rsquo;s website?  What lessons has the Minister&rsquo;s Department learned to ensure history is not repeated and that such a situation does not recur in five or ten years from now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I received the Laois report recently.  One action we are taking is that we have developed a methodology for classification of different types of unfinished estates comprising categories such as completed but with paths, lighting, parks and green spaces unfinished; initial phases of development completed but other parts under construction; half-built units, including weatherproofed units and walled but unroofed buildings and so on.  We wrote to city and county managers a fortnight ago seeking their help in completing the survey.  It is <Col N="673"/>early days but there are themes of public safety, completion and management of essential infrastructure and amenities and the long-term future and resolution of sites.</P>
        <P>The kernel of the Deputy&rsquo;s question was in regard to how we stop this happening again.  The strongest action we can take to stop it happening again is to put in place a proper planning system.  I ask the Deputy to get the co-operation of his colleagues in the city and county councils throughout the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>They have it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to work closely with the management teams and the professional planners and listen carefully to their advice.</P>
        <P>To be frank, I was flabbergasted to see that in my county of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown Fine Gael councillors were to the fore in promoting even more rezonings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Good man, Ciar&aacute;n.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Have they and the Deputy learned nothing from the mistakes made?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s party has no councillors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I urge the Deputy to work with his colleagues and tell them to stop putting forward these mad ideas for rezoning.  The goose that laid the golden egg is long gone and it would be constructive if the Deputy and his colleagues would think carefully about sustainable planning rather than rezoning land as the solution to our economic woes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be better if the Minister of State was not contentious answering questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>He is passionate.  That is why his party has no councillors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>To deal specifically with the issue rather than the charges being made by the Minister of State, what hope will he give to the people living in developments where the developer and builder are bankrupt and are not in a position to finish off these housing estates?  What hope can he give those people?</P>
        <P>In light of the Minister receiving the Laois report, is he willing to make a statement at this stage or can he give us a definitive date as to when he will announce further information?  The inaction by Government in recent years has brought us to this point.  In regard to local authorities reporting directly to the Department, what changes has the Minister made or will he make in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not wish to be confrontational but to echo the real concerns of people, we are putting together a best practice manual to assist local authorities in deciding on the remedial action to take.  A primary concern is health and safety, and we must ensure we do everything we can to stop children or vulnerable people going into unfinished developments.  That key issue of securing the site is required.  We can use the existing planning legislation to do much of that.  We can also use the Derelict Sites Acts from 1990.</P>
      
        <P>In terms of developments where the developer simply does not have the funds or is in liquidation, many of these loans will come under the ownership of the National Assets Management Agency and it will be a matter first and foremost for the agency to decide what to do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Looking realistically at the issue, local authorities will take a proactive response.  I spoke about unfinished buildings, but there is also the danger of unfinished roads that have notreceived their final coats and that could present health and safety risks.  The local authorities will need to take a proactive approach to ensuring that these issues are addressed in the short term.</P><Col N="674"/>
        <P Just="Left">On the wider issues, for example, where several homes are occupied in an estate but the estate is largely unfinished, and where there might be litter or sewage problems, I believe that county and city managers will do all that they can to improve the quality of life in those areas.</P>
        <P>There is no pot of money for completion, of which I am aware.  In many cases, there are bonds that have been put up by the developer.  We will see what can be done to utilise them to improve life.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest>  his plans to amend the Electoral Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Electoral law is subject to ongoing review to make necessary changes to maintain and develop a robust and modern legal framework as a principal element of the operation of our democratic system.  In the past five years, five separate electoral Bills have been enacted.  In 2009 alone, two were enacted.  Looking over the past ten years, an average of one electoral Bill per year was enacted by the Oireachtas having been brought forward by me, as Minister, or by one of my predecessors.</P>
        <P>More recently, in February 2010, I published a general scheme of legislation to provide for a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  Within this context, necessary legislative provisions in respect of the holding of a mayoral election are currently being developed.  These include amendments to the Electoral Acts.</P>
        <P>My other plans for amendment of the Electoral Acts relate to the establishment of an electoral commission and to considerations on financing the political system.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government, agreed in 2007, contains a commitment to the establishment of an independent electoral commission.  The renewed programme for Government, agreed in October 2009, reaffirms this commitment and identifies a range of responsibilities which the commission will be mandated to fulfil.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An independent electoral commission will require new legislation for purposes of its establishment and to transfer to it a range of roles and responsibilities including those assigned to the Standards in Public Office Commission in electoral law, those of the Constituency Commission and those currently assigned to me, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This will involve changes to more than 20 primary Acts and to the associated regulations.</P>
        <P>Towards implementing the programme for Government commitments, and to assist in consideration of the issues involved, I commissioned a report by an expert group from University College Dublin.  I published the report, entitled &ldquo;A Preliminary Study on the Establishment of an Electoral Commission in Ireland&rdquo;, for consultation in February 2009.  The UCD study recommends that an electoral commission be established through the enactment of an electoral commission Act.  This Act would amend and consolidate the law in this area, bringing together in one Act the law relating to referendums and elections to local authorities, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the European Parliament, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the office of President of Ireland.  This would be a major task and it is part of our considerations.</P>
  
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution is currently undertaking an examination of the system used for the election of members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, and in the course of this work has considered issues in respect of the administration and functioning of Ireland&rsquo;s electoral <Col N="675"/>system generally.  The outcome of the committee&rsquo;s deliberations should also inform work on the amendment of the Electoral Acts to deliver on the Government&rsquo;s electoral reform commitments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, the 2009 renewed programme for Government contains a commitment to restricting political donations to individual Irish citizens and residents and to setting up a new political fund to which donations from private bodies would be made.  I am now giving consideration to approaches to the implementation of this commitment, which will also require amendments to the Electoral Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Would the Minister agree that, after three years in office and after putting this in the programme for Government in 2007, the Government's passage of this piece of legislation is quite tardy? He has not even published the heads of a Bill on the independent electoral commission.  When will the statutory independent electoral commission, which we support, be established?  Nobody on this side of the House would have any difficulty with it.  We are just waiting for the Minister to publish a report.  Maybe he is having difficulties with his partners in Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When will the election for the directly elected Dublin mayor be held?  The Minister has stated that it is his intention to hold it this year, but could he be more definitive than that?  Intentions are lovely.  He had intentions in 2007 about setting up an electoral commission and we have not yet seen it.  When will the Dublin mayoral election be?</P>

	<P>We will have the legislation published before the end of this session.  I stated that definitively.  I have stated, and announced the other evening, as Deputy Hogan will be aware, in response to his own Private Members&rsquo; Bill, that I will be setting up the electoral commission on a non-statutory basis.  The legislation that is required to set it up on a statutory basis is complex and will take a considerable amount of time.  However, there are practical difficulties because the franchise section in my Department must concentrate on the considerable amount of work on the mayoralty legislation it is doing in tandem with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and Parliamentary Counsel, and that is taking a considerable amount of time and effort.  Resources cannot be diverted and that is why I stated the other evening that I wanted to set up the electoral commission on a non-statutory basis to begin with.</P>
        <P>I also stated, as Deputy Hogan may recall, that when the UCD study was published we asked for observations from various political parties.  We received one from the Labour Party but we got no submission from Deputy Hogan&rsquo;s party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister did not need any submission from me.  We had it already published and it was on our website.  It is called New Politics.  If the Minister wants a hard copy of it, I would have no difficulty providing one.  The Minister is high on rhetoric and low on output in terms of his promised electoral reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister be asking the chairman of his party to withdraw remarks made in the context of by-elections when we were discussing my party&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill on setting a limit for the filling of casual vacancies, namely this notion that the filling of casual vacancies within six months would undermine the Government mandate?  What does that say about democracy and electoral reform?  Could I ask if the Minister will be asking the chairman of his party to withdraw those remarks?</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>  the position regarding the home choice scheme; the funding that was set aside at the set-up of this scheme; the structures that were required to be put in place as a guarantee to deal with possible defaults; if the start-up costs for this scheme were derived from any earlier funding programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22249/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>More than 1,400 prospective purchasers formally registered interest on the dedicated home choice loan website and to date, 68 applications have been made.  Of these, four have been approved, with three of these now drawn down, 36 applications <Col N="677"/>have been turned down, seven have been withdrawn and further information has been sought in respect of 21 applications.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The scheme is demand-led.  As such, no budget has been set and no moneys that could be deployed elsewhere have been ring-fenced for the scheme.  The extent of the loan book arising will depend solely on the level of demand and loans drawn down.</P>
        <P>The scheme is underpinned by rigorous lending criteria to protect the financial position of local authorities as well as prospective first-time buyers.  All applications are assessed having regard to an applicant&rsquo;s ability to pay, credit history and all other aspects of the formal lending policy.  An applicant&rsquo;s ability to pay is also stress-tested to assess his or her ability to repay at current rates and in the event of significant interest rate rises.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In order to minimise risk and to ensure that the processing of loan applications is carried out on the basis of the fullest available information on the financial standing and general credit-worthiness of applicants, the credit policy includes a requirement to perform credit checks for each application.  Credit checks are carried out using information provided by the Irish Credit Bureau.  In addition, judgment checks are carried out using information from the Courts Service.  These checks are intended to ensure that local authorities are equipped with the fullest information so that they can avoid unnecessarily risky lending while continuing to lend to low-income but credit-worthy households.</P>
        <P>As with all other local authority mortgage lending,  where a loan stands in default, section 11(10) of Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 provides that a local authority may make such monetary arrangements with a borrower as it considers equitable to take account of the particular circumstances of the borrower.  My Department issued guidance recently to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.  This guidance is closely based on the statutory code of conduct introduced in February 2009 by the Financial Regulator.  However, given the comprehensive nature of the credit policy, I do not anticipate significant difficulties with arrears under the home choice loan scheme.</P>
        <P>Costs of approximately &euro;280,000 were incurred in 2009 in establishing the scheme, including the setting up of a central processing unit within the Affordable Homes Partnership, AHP.  These costs were met fully from within existing resources within the AHP.  It should be noted that a significant element of the staffing costs was incurred in the development of the loan processing model which applies to the home choice loan but which has also now been used in the development of revised systems for processing and credit checking of normal local authority house purchase loan applications under other schemes such as affordable housing, shared ownership, etc.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  In earlier questions on this matter, the Minister of State said the home choice programme was a response to the credit crunch.  We know the credit crunch was caused by a number of factors, one being light touch regulation and over-lending as a result and an over-valuing of property in the property market and loans being granted on the basis that properties would increase in value indefinitely.  To qualify for this programme, one has to have received two refusals from two different financial institutions before approaching the local authority.  Will the Minister of State agree that this is creating a double jeopardy for borrowers in that they have been refused twice?  The most likely reasons for refusals are a person&rsquo;s income being too low or the property being over-valued.  The Minister of State is creating a jeopardy for these people by facilitating a situation whereby the local authorities will grant a loan.  The Minister of State in his response stated that more <Col N="678"/>than 4,000 people inquired about this scheme and four people have been given approval.  Is this approval in full or approval in principle because there is a significant difference?</P>
        <P>The departmental website advertises this scheme as not being applicable to the affordable homes programme.  Given that local authorities are now selling affordable homes on the open market, is the home choice programme also open to those applicants?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked a number of questions.  I agree the credit crunch was the reason I introduced the home choice scheme because the banks were not lending and the information was that people were finding it difficult to meet the 20% deposit which banks and financial institutions were seeking.  With regard to two refusals, this is not a new practice.  It is well known to those Members who have served on local authorities that this stipulation applies to all local authority loans since 1987.  Therefore, the home choice loan stipulation is no different from any other local authority loan.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The number of prospective purchasers who registered interest is 1,400.  Four people have been approved, three people have turned down for loans and further information is being sought from 21 applicants.</P>
        <P>With regard to the affordable homes being put on the open market, I made a number of changes to the scheme in recent times, as the Deputy may be aware.  It now applies to second-hand homes but I have not extended it to include affordable homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State.  Have the Minister of State and his Department decided to continue with this product, which is a failed product?  Any commercial institution would have closed it down immediately after a couple of months, if not within six months.  The public is voting with its feet on this issue.  They are staying away from it as they are fearful of a repeat of the sub-prime lending issue.  I ask the Minister of State to explain the &euro;500 million fund which was earmarked for this product.  What is happening that money?  Would it not be put to better use in other areas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I disagree with the Deputy as regards the loan.  It is in existence as a safety valve, an alternative for people who cannot get a loan from the financial institutions.  There is no great activity in the financial institutions in the granting of loans for house purchase by first-time buyers.  On account of the loan being available, it is possible that the financial institutions are prepared to give people loans.  As regards the level of activity, since the changes were introduced recently in April, the number of visits to the dedicated website has increased by 154%.  New visits represent approximately 80% of all traffic on the website.  We know this because of the number of contacts from auctioneers around the country.  There is no significant cost involved in providing this loan.  I am not prepared to remove it until I am satisfied that the financial institutions are making loans available to the public, especially first-time buyers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the &euro;500 million?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>This is demand-led scheme so there is no pot of money, as it were.  This money is drawn down from the HFA as required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The figures speak for themselves.  On the affordable homes aspect, I do not know if the Minister of State has made a final decision on whether the scheme will be extended into the area of affordable homes.  My advice would be that he should not extend it because there are already two jeopardies in this programme as I have outlined.  If local authorities who were trying to get rid of affordable homes were in a position to also finance them, the Minister of State would be creating a third jeopardy.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="679"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The loan does not apply to the affordable homes side.  People will need to appreciate there are existing annuity loans with local authorities for people in certain categories who do not reach the level of income of those entitled to apply for a home choice loan. </P>

	<P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 7 and 43 together.</P>
        <P>The introduction of a directly elected mayor for Dublin will deliver significantly strengthened leadership for the city and region, with enhanced accountability and a direct connection with the citizen.  The mayor will have a powerful role in setting out strategic policy across Dublin and oversight of operational implementation.  He or she will also have a strong mandate to integrate the activities of local government and the wider public service in and across Dublin.</P>
        <P>The mayor&rsquo;s powers will include the capacity to ensure that activities across the Dublin region&rsquo;s local authorities are consistent with the regional strategic framework.  In addition, I have agreed with the Minister for Transport that the mayor will have a strong role in relation to transport planning in Dublin.  The mayor will chair a greater Dublin area transport council within the national transport authority, responsible for approving and monitoring the implementation of the key transport plans for Dublin &mdash; the greater Dublin area transport strategy and strategic traffic management plan.  In doing so the mayor will be well placed to ensure coherence between Dublin&rsquo;s spatial and transport planning.  I have this week published additional draft heads of the Dublin Mayor Bill and regional authority on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that the election of the mayor will take place this year.  The general scheme of the legislation to provide for the mayor was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in February, as an opportunity for further consultation before its finalisation and to facilitate early implementation of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions once enacted.  The Bill is currently being drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel as a matter of priority.</P>
        <P>I met with representatives of the Opposition parties on 4 March and briefed them on the mayor&rsquo;s functions and responsibilities.  My Department is also engaging with the Dublin local authorities to make the necessary practical and operational preparations for the mayor&rsquo;s election and introduction.  I look forward to the introduction of the Bill to the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We have not been given any new information by the Minister.  It will be October by the time the legislation is published and brought through the Houses.  There will be no mayoral election before the end of October and it will hardly be held in December so that leaves November if the Minister wishes to hold the election this year.  Has there been agreement in Government to hold the election this year?  The Dublin Chamber of Commerce was initially very positive about the heads of the Bill when published.  How does the Minister <Col N="680"/>envisage the relationship between the directly elected Dublin Mayor and the other four local authorities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will know that there is Government agreement because it is set out in the renewed programme for Government.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No, it is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It clearly says 2010 there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s other question, I met members of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and they are the very people who have been calling for quite some time for the introduction of a mayor for the Dublin region.  I am happy to be the Minister to deliver that.  I wish to engage further with the Dublin Chamber of Commerce to ensure that it meets with its requirements.  I understand the chamber sees this as a driving force for a competitive Dublin which can compete with the likes of Munich, Paris or London.  We have seen the dynamic effect of having directly elected mayors in those particular regions.  That is the most important aspect.  We must now see cities as driving forces for the regions themselves.  That will be the centrepiece of the White Paper.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also asked about the relationship of the mayor with the four local authorities.  That was clearly set out in the heads of the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We said that the mayor would have an overarching role.  It is similar to the relationship that exists in London.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is different.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The London model has various boroughs with councillors in place and the mayor interacts with them, as well as interacting with an assembly that can question the mayor and hold him to account.  The same sort of model will apply here. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>In the absence of a specific date, could we end up with a situation where the legislation is going through the House, a date has been decided and the campaign is taking place on the doorsteps at the same time?  The Minister is indicating that the election will take place before Christmas.  It is quite a big Bill, although only the heads have been completed at this stage.  It would be bizarre to debate legislation about a post that has yet to be created while an election is taking place.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Hogan referred earlier to the local authorities in Dublin.  Any new position in politics requires power to be derived from or put into that post.  The Bill is unclear as to where those powers will be appropriated from.  They can either come from councillors or managers.  Can the Minister clarify where he sees those mayoral powers coming from?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be very clear about it.  I have met with councillors on a number of occasions and I have said that I see the powers coming from the managers.  That is clearly the case and I have stated so on a number of occasions.</P>
        <P>As to the Deputy&rsquo;s initial point, it is up to the political parties to decide when they want to campaign.  They can select their candidates and start campaigning now if they wish.  I do not determine the behaviour of political parties or individual candidates, but I do hope that we will get the very best candidates in the field, be they from political parties or independents.  I look forward to a stimulating campaign and a good debate about the future of this city.</P>

        <Quest> the reason for the delay in the progress of the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 through the Houses of the Oireachtas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
   <QRef>[22374/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
 
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 proposes to give statutory effect to the recommendations of the working group that reviewed the management of dog breeding establishments.  The working group was set up in September 2004 by the then Minister to consider the regulation of dog breeding establishments and to make recommendations on the proper management of such establishments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dog breeding establishments are currently unregulated, save for those which are members of the Irish Boarding Kennels and other similar groups and which submit to a form of self-regulation.  The recommendations of the working group were submitted to the Minister in August 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 defines a dog breeding establishment as a premises with not less than six bitches of four months or older which are capable of breeding.  The Bill proposes that all dog breeding establishments be required to register with the relevant local authority, and that they pay a registration fee and meet a minimum set of veterinary, welfare and other standards.</P>
        <P>The Bill has completed Committee Stage in the Seanad, where it was initiated on 18 December 2009.  During this time, meetings have taken place between senior officials of my <Col N="682"/>Department and the Irish Greyhound Board, the Irish Coursing Club, the Dogs&rsquo; Trust, the Irish Kennel Club and other stakeholders to discuss their concerns.  I expect Report and Final Stages to be taken in the Seanad shortly, after which the Bill will begin the legislative process in the D&aacute;il, subject to the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Regulations will be introduced following enactment of the Bill, which will set out the detailed requirements that dog breeding establishments will have to meet to comply with the legislation.  The draft regulations will be subject to consultation with the interested parties.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A few weeks ago, the joint Oireachtas committee had a meeting on this matter, with an extensive debate.  There were significant contributions from the Minister&rsquo;s partners in Government who had quite a lot to say about the legislation.  Has the Minister received the transcripts of that committee meeting?  Does he propose to table any amendments on Report Stage in the Seanad, given the contributions made at the committee by his Government colleagues?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I should advise the House that once another House is seized of the Bill it is not up to this House to discuss the Upper House&rsquo;s handling of it.  However, I am sure the Minister will answer the question in general terms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to do so.  It is certainly my intention to introduce amendments, but the question is whether we will do so in the Seanad, or whether we can do it in this House on Committee Stage.  I think it is probably better if we do it in this House and then go back to the Seanad.  I have listened very carefully to the contributions that were made by Deputies in all parties.  It is interesting that this piece of legislation has given rise to quite a lot of debate.  It is really extraordinary when one thinks of it. </P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> the reply that he has issued in response to the recent threat of fines from the EU Commission for failure to adhere to European Court of Justice rulings concerning illegal  developments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
 <QRef>[22355/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the question refers to European Court of Justice cases C215-06 and C66-06, both of which relate to the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and which are the subject of letters of formal notice from the Commission to which the Irish Government will shortly be responding.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to case C215-06, the ECJ ruled, in June 2008, that the Irish retention permission system did not comply with the EIA Directive.  In response to the judgment, amendments are being made in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009, which is to be enacted this summer, to remove the possibility of retention for EIA development, other than in exceptional circumstances, and to abolish the seven year rule for enforcement action in respect of extractive industry EIA development.   Pending enactment of the amending legislation, my Department issued a circular letter to planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in October 2008, outlining the approach to be taken in dealing with retention applications for EIA developments in the interim.  I understand the circular has been effective in preventing applications <Col N="683"/>for retention of EIA-type developments being accepted by planning authorities since its publication.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In case C66-06, in November 2008 the ECJ found that Ireland&rsquo;s system of screening projects to assess the requirement to carry out EIAs for certain categories of agricultural development was over-reliant on size thresholds and did not take sufficient account of other relevant criteria such as the cumulative effects of development and the location of those developments.  In response to the judgment, my Department is proposing to lower the thresholds for affected projects under which an EIA is mandatory, introduce enhanced notification and screening processes for relevant sub-threshold development, and abolish any planning exemptions for relevant projects where an EIA is required.</P>
        <P>The ECJ judgment also ruled that the Irish regulations transposing the EIA directive in regard to aquaculture activities were deficient, and this matter is being addressed by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>What planning exemptions does the Minister of State propose to bring under the remit of the EIA?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is a matter for decision under the legislation and the regulations.  If Deputy Hogan has any specific ideas he wishes to address to me I would be more than happy to receive them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was wondering whether the Minister had given any thought to the necessary exemptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have that information to hand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am trying to be helpful.  Perhaps we can deal with the matter under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009, which is going through Committee Stage.  Perhaps at that stage the Minister of State could supply us with the information on what he has in mind.  We could discuss the scope of the EIA to which the Minister of State referred during the course of the Committee Stage debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We can.  I can revert to the Deputy on that specific instance.  To summarise what we are trying to do with the planning system, we are trying to make it much more rigorous with an impetus from this country and Europe to include environmental impact assessment and development plans so we will have much more certainty within the planning process.  That will benefit both the communities and residents but also developers.  The more certainty there is in the system, the better the planning system will be for sustainable economic development as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, was in Opposition he often raised this country&rsquo;s failure to comply with European Union judgments.  I would have thought he would be very specific about what needs to be done for us to comply with the three rulings concerned.  Even though the Green Party has been in Government for the past three years we are still being hauled over the coals by the European Union for failing to comply with European Court of Justice rulings.  In this country we still seem to battle out the EU on its decisions; we do not just comply with them.  Does the Minister of State have specific plans to introduce legislation that will address the three cases to which he referred this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There is much good news in this.  My belief is that since coming into office my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has given the highest priority to the transposition and implementation of EU environmental legislation.  He has secured the closure of <Col N="684"/>27 cases in the past two and a half years.  Deputy Tuffy might think we are being hauled over the coals on a regular basis but I think we are shaking Commission members by the hand and asking what we can do and what needs to be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the five rulings?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">At an environmental Council meeting in March 2010 the Minister met the current Environment Commissioner, Mr. Potocnik, and reaffirmed this country&rsquo;s commitment on EU compliance.  To throw a few more numbers into the mix 33 cases were outstanding when the Minister came into office, but there are now 23.  That is a 50% reduction in the number of cases.  Deputy Tuffy will be aware from her legal background that one cannot just wave a magic wand and implement compliance overnight.  From meeting with the Minister in the past three years I am aware that we have been pulling out all the stops to achieve compliance.  In some cases a lengthy legal process has to be gone through and the Attorney General must have oversight and detailed involvement in all of those cases.  Good news is emerging.  The amount of cases is reducing.  In many cases we must seek co-operation across all branches of Government.  It is difficult to get the resources.  It is difficult in-house but in other Departments it is difficult to find those resources as well.  We are doing our best and this is a good news story.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 203 together.</P>
        <P>I published the Green Paper on local government, Stronger Local Democracy &mdash; Options for Change, in April 2008.  That was followed by an extensive programme of national consultation for purposes of informing the preparation of the White Paper on local government.  The environment has altered considerably since April 2008, not least due to the severe economic downturn.  Work on the White Paper has also had to have regard to the report of the Commission on Taxation, the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, and the renewed programme for Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A dedicated Cabinet committee is finalising the major strategic issues for inclusion in the White Paper, which will be published as soon as possible following the completion of the committee&rsquo;s deliberations.  It is essential we get the White Paper right and that it is grounded in today&rsquo;s challenges, contains appropriate ambition and will be readily implementable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have put other significant local government initiatives in place in recent months.  I established the Limerick Local Government Committee to prepare a report on the most appropriate arrangements for local government for the city and county of Limerick.  I have published the general scheme of the legislation to provide for the mayor for Dublin.  I also established the Local Government Efficiency Review Group and I have requested that it complete its work by mid-2010.  I have asked the group to review the cost base, expenditure and numbers employed in local authorities with a view to reporting on specific recommendations to reduce costs, the effectiveness of particular programmes, optimal efficiency in the way programmes are delivered and any other proposals to enhance value for money in the delivery of services at local level.  The group&rsquo;s findings and recommendations will then be considered in the appro<Col N="685"/>priate policy and financial contexts.  Collectively, these initiatives will be of great importance to the future of the local government system and its stakeholders.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the local government expenditure group another version of the bord snip report?  Local authorities are very hard pressed.  They have lost many staff and many of them are struggling financially.  It would be worrying if the intention were to have a similar type of exercise to the earlier McCarthy report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If one wants to put it in those terms, I looked at what McCarthy had done and I felt it was necessary to carry out an efficiency review of the local government sector.  Deputy Tuffy will have seen the recent reports about the failure to collect commercial water rates.  It is absolutely essential that we get the full value for the &euro;11 billion, current and capital, spent annually by local authorities.  That must be viewed against the requirement to manage and control overall public spending, having regard to the need to restore balance in the public finances.  While much has been achieved to date, such as the new costing system, shared services, and the implementation of a modern financial management system, audit committees and performance indicators, more must be done.  The focus will be on current spending by local authorities.  The group will address capital expenditure issues to the extent of their impact on current expenditure.  I met with the group, whose work is ongoing.  It is absolutely vital we deal with this issue because we have had local authorities spending money in the good times but we are no longer in the good times and we have to tighten our belt, not just at central level but at local level as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister needs to be careful that he does not wipe them out of existence entirely.  They have had to cut their budgets so much that they are really stretched as they try to do important work.  I wanted to make that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the things I did not mention in my response was the introduction for the first time of a tax on second homes.  I recall vividly that when it was introduced, Deputies on the Opposition benches said we would be lucky to collect &euro;20 million.  In fact, we have collected up to &euro;63 million very quickly.  It has worked efficiently.  I do not think the local authorities can complain because we have been as generous as we can, in the current circumstances.  When the pay reduction was imposed, they were allowed to retain a substantial amount of it.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to introducing comprehensive legislation to address noise nuisance.  Extensive public consultation was undertaken as part of the preparatory process, during which over 200 submissions were received from the public and key stakeholders.  After due consideration of the submissions, the general scheme of a noise nuisance Bill was prepared and approved by the Government in May 2009.  At that time, a number of issues that need to be addressed during the drafting of the Bill were identified.  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is progressing matters in this regard.  The Bill is scheduled for publication later this year.  Although a wide range of measures are in place to deal with noise from a variety of sources, it is my aim that the new legislation <Col N="686"/>will take a more integrated approach to noise nuisance, for example, through codes of practice for construction, commercial and domestic situations.  In addition, measures will be introduced to increase awareness of how noise nuisance can be addressed.  I am examining options to strengthen existing local authority powers, including the introduction of a system of fixed payment notices for noise nuisance offences.  As things stand, a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact his or her local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  The Act provides that any person or group of persons may seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.

	<P Just="Left">Following the enactment of the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Act 2009, my Department assumed responsibility on 15 January 2010 for a range of foreshore functions, including all foreshore energy-related developments, including oil, gas, wind, wave and tidal energy developments; aggregate and mineral extraction developments on the foreshore; foreshore projects in respect of port companies and harbour authorities governed by the Harbours Acts 1946, 1996 and 2000; foreshore projects in respect of any other harbour; harbour-related developments intended for commercial trade; and all other foreshore projects other than those relating to aquaculture and sea fisheries.  </P>
	<P Just="Left">In accordance with the Foreshore Acts, a lease or licence can be issued if it is in the public interest.  At present, the processing of a foreshore application includes assessment of the application by the Department's internal technical advisers and, where necessary, the marine licence vetting committee that advises on scientific matters; consultation with statutory and non-statutory consultees, including relevant Departments and agencies; a period of public consultation, normally of 21 days; valuation of the site to be occupied by the applicant; and other public interest elements that may arise in particular cases.  </P>
	<P Just="Left">More than 700 foreshore applications for leases, licences and permits are currently being dealt with by my Department.  The applications, which vary greatly in terms of size of infrastructure project and level of complexity, also include a licence application from Dublin City Council for the construction of a water cooling channel to service the proposed waste-to-energy facility at Poolbeg.  As the licence application in question is one of a large number at different stages of consideration under the foreshore consent process, my Department will be in contact with Dublin City Council on the matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to raise this important issue this evening.  A statement issued by the HSE on 12 May last, in which plans for a reduction in non-consultant hospital doctors were announced, will have consequences for services in Roscommon, Portiuncula and Mullingar hospitals.  It is clear from discussions with health management and professionals that a perfect storm is being allowed to develop by the HSE, in order to facilitate the implementation of the Hanly report by means of a hatchet.  The HSE is referring to this as &ldquo;reconfiguration&rdquo;.  It involves the transfer, over time, of accident and emergency and surgery services from Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals to the University College Hospital in Galway.  It will also involve the closure of the local maternity unit in Ballinasloe, which is the only maternity unit in the country to be accredited as a &ldquo;baby-friendly&rdquo; hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE is using the shortage of non-consultant hospital doctors and the introduction of the EU working time directive as a means of downgrading services at Portiuncula and Roscommon hospitals.  This staffing issue is threatening the operation of the accident and emergency departments at both hospitals, which currently operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The overnight downgrading of these hospital services, without planning, will result in loss of life <Col N="688"/>locally.  Foreign non-consultant hospital doctors are not coming to Ireland for a number of reasons.  Red tape and the short duration of visas represent a major part of the problem.  This is not something that has happened overnight.  It is only now, at the 11th hour, that the Government has started to discuss the issue and to try to resolve the problem.  It did not become a priority for the Government until it started to realise not only that it will affect the smaller hospitals, as secretly planned, but also that it will threaten the operation of the major regional centres.  This is a deliberate act of national sabotage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The management of the HSE claims that it will provide a better and safer service and that non-emergency work will be transferred from the regional centres, such as the University College Hospital Galway, UCHG, to the local hospitals.  While some people in the Ballinasloe area may be naive enough to believe this, the people of Roscommon have seen the HSE renege on previous commitments.  The HSE claimed all surgeons appointed to the amalgamated departments of surgery at Portiuncula and Roscommon would be joint appointments.  We now find out that the Roscommon hospital has been air-brushed from these surgical contracts and the posts will be shared between University College Hospital Galway, and Portiuncula.  Eventually, these particular surgeons will be relocated to Galway city.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The people of Roscommon were told by the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, that they either use or lose their hospital, yet no funds have been provided to upgrade the sterilisation facilities to ensure additional procedures could be performed in the hospital.  In the past four years not one patient has been put through Roscommon County Hospital under the National Treatment Purchase Fund even though the hospital has the capacity and no waiting lists.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Roscommon was promised additional out-patient clinics.  Instead, the HSE has reduced the number of clinics that take place at the hospital.  On 23 April, at a meeting with local public representatives in Portiuncula Hospital, HSE management informed them the super-manager would not be appointed until the end of the year at the earliest.  Yet, less than a month later, the HSE made an announcement of an appointment without any notice.  I understand the individual in question is a consultant radiologist, Mr. David O&rsquo;Keeffe, based in UCHG.  His appointment will cover six acute hospitals, community services and long-stay hospitals in an area that takes three hours to travel across, more than it takes to travel from Dublin to Cork.</P>
        <P>While I have no doubt that Mr. O&rsquo;Keeffe is a fine individual, with all due respect to him, we do not need another Brendan Drumm &Oacute;g to do the Government&rsquo;s dirty work in implementing the Hanly report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister of State clarify what will happen to accident and emergency services in Portiuncula and Roscommon hospitals?  What is the secret intention behind the establishment of this new super-manager and the reneging on previous commitments regarding future services?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery and maintenance of the best quality health service possible and providing the highest standard of patient care in an effective and efficient way within the resources allocated.  Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals play an important part in the HSE West network of acute hospitals and provide a range of acute, diagnostic and support services to both adults and children in their catchment areas, which include east Galway, Roscommon, north Tipperary, Offaly and Westmeath.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE has been working in recent years to enhance collaboration between UCHG, Portiuncula and Roscommon hospitals in the provision of services.  This is occurring, for <Col N="689"/>example, in the reconfiguration of the surgical and anaesthetic departments of Portiuncula and Roscommon hospitals into a joint department of surgery and anaesthesia.  In addition, the HSE, in line with the commitment in its national service plan for 2010, has commenced the process of preparing a plan for the future configuration of acute hospital services in the HSE West as a whole.  A process of dialogue with the hospitals, staff and other interests has begun and will continue to be conducted on a consultative and inclusive basis in the interests of ensuring safe, effective and sustainable services in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>The HSE plans to recruit a manager with responsibility for UCHG, Portiuncula Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital.  This initiative involves the expansion of the current post of manager at Galway and is designed to promote good co-ordination of service delivery.  The purpose of this is simply to improve management processes and thereby improve services for patients.  This planned appointment is also in line with the approach on the governance of acute hospitals recommended in the Health Information and Quality Authority&rsquo;s 2009 report on quality and safety of services at the mid-western regional hospital Ennis.  This report identified integrated governance across hospital networks as an important factor in ensuring higher quality services for patients.</P>
        <P>The current position on this matter is that the public competition conducted by the Public Appointments Service did not result in the selection of a successful candidate.  The HSE is, therefore, considering further options in order to provide for this key appointment and hopes to be in a position to make an announcement presently.</P>
        <P>The Minister is satisfied the plan to recruit a manager with responsibility for the hospitals will enhance the capacity for collaboration in service provision, provide a more strategic approach to the management of the hospitals concerned and ensure the provision of better and safer services to the people of the region.  Both Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals will continue to play key roles in the provision of hospital services to the population of the west.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeBehan"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Behan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the future of the HSE in the light of recent developments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are all aware, and I certainly acknowledge, individual staff members in the HSE are conscientious, diligent and public-spirited, but time and again the HSE as an organisation has proven to be disturbingly dysfunctional and unfit for purpose.  Sadly, in recent days we learned the failures of this organisation have had lethal consequences for some of the vulnerable people with whose care it was entrusted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These past weeks have given us proof of the dysfunctional nature and cataclysmic failures of an organisation entrusted by the D&aacute;il with the care of vulnerable children.  We learned of the troubled life and sad death of Daniel McAnaspie, a young man in need of a caring environment, in need of a support structure, in need of help.  He was a member of a family which had to face a number of serious crises and traumas in their young lives.  His was a family failed by the State care system and Daniel, a young man, was allowed to fall through the cracks.  His life is now over &mdash; a young man whose needs were well documented yet ignored.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not only the vulnerable young who have been let down by the HSE.  We also heard the heartbreaking stories raised in this week&rsquo;s excellent &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme on the lack of support, the lack of services and the lack of a strategy to help those affected by Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and dementia.  In the programme, we saw older people and their families fighting for services to which they are entitled, including respite care, home help, day-care facilities, residential care facilities of an appropriate standard and counselling for the women <Col N="690"/>and men struck down by this insidious disease and their families.  The evidence of this programme should not be forgotten, such as the tears of frustration of grown men caring for their mothers, doing the job of the State and struggling to make up for the failures of the HSE.</P>
        <P>We are witnessing the gradual shutting down of HSE-run nursing homes, very often without proper consideration being given to the option of upgrading those local facilities.  Instead, the elderly and frail patients of these public facilities are being bundled out the doors into private nursing homes without any serious consideration for their feelings, their former friendships or their sense of belonging.  Sadly, many of these people have died shortly after being moved and nobody in authority seems to care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I could go into detail about the number of separated children or unaccompanied minors missing from State care.  HSE data from 2007 show 41 children went missing from care.  In all, between 2000 and 2007, 441 separated children were recorded as missing from their care placemen,t and of these only 53 were accounted for.  What is that if not an admission of abject failure?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are only now getting a glimpse of the outrageous power struggle being played out in the corridors of power in the past few days.  The organisation tasked with responsibility for the health of our nation at first refused to provide to the elected Government and D&aacute;il information on the number of children who have died in its care.  Only after a contentious meeting with the Taoiseach, as reported in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i>, did the organisation backtrack on that stance.  This is simply outrageous.  It raises the question who governs this country &mdash; the Government or the HSE, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, or Brendan Drumm?</P>
        <P>Members should now join forces to demand an end to this monstrous bureaucratic experiment called the HSE.  It is dysfunctional, dangerous and defeated.  I believe it no longer commands the confidence of this House or the people we represent and it should be brought to an end.</P>
      
        <P>It is high time for us to hold a mature discussion about what we can do to replace this dysfunctional organisation with a health care system in which we can have confidence to look after the care needs of the entire population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the principles underpinning the establishment of the Health Service Executive as a single, national authority with responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.  While I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s concern in respect of some of the issues raised by him, this should not detract from the significant progress that the HSE has achieved on several fronts in the reform of our health and social care services since its establishment five years ago.</P>

        <P>The strategic reasons for abolishing the health boards and certain other agencies and replacing them with a single national authority remain as valid as ever.  Reform of our health system was driven by the need to bring about improvements in services to patients and other users through the organisation and delivery of consistent national services, based on objective standards and implemented in a uniform manner throughout the country which made the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The vital work that is now well under way to implement a national cancer control strategy was made possible by the unified HSE structure.  Similarly, the implementation of national standards for nursing homes throughout the country has also been greatly facilitated by a single structure, as has the introduction of the Fair Deal nursing home scheme.  The implementation of critical primary care and chronic illness strategies also require a single, national management <Col N="691"/>structure.  Over time, these strategies will deliver real and tangible benefits that would not have been possible to achieve under the previously fragmented system.</P>
        <P>The HSE has recognised that its own internal structures must be reorganised to improve the delivery of health and personal social services on an integrated basis and to improve accountability at all levels of the organisation.  That is why it has moved to put in place an administrative regional structure, within the national structure, to drive operational performance and accountability on the ground.</P>
        <P>The sheer scale and complexity of the health service reform programme cannot be underestimated.  It is the biggest reform project ever undertaken in the country and change of this magnitude can only be successfully achieved over a timeframe of several years.  It is inevitable that deficiencies will come to light as the reform programme evolves and it is imperative that the HSE takes the necessary corrective action to address these as they arise.</P>
        <P>However, as I stated earlier, the policy objectives behind the establishment of the HSE are as valid today as they were seven years ago when the Government took the strategic decision to establish a single national authority to replace the seven regional health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the three area health boards and several other agencies.  Improving the range and quality of services to patients, clients and other users of our health and personal social services is at the heart of the reform programme and the Minister for Health and Children remains steadfast in her view that this can best be achieved through a unified national structure as the progressive implementation of the national cancer control programme has clearly demonstrated.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter in the Adjournment debate on the floor of the D&aacute;il tonight on behalf of the people of Longford-Westmeath.  I am flabbergasted and frustrated that, once again, I find myself compelled to stand in this forum of the people this evening on behalf of up to 120,000 people throughout Longford and Westmeath to reflect the fears, concerns and apprehensions which they have raised over future developments at this important regional hospital in Mullingar.  I do so in the context of speculation or rumours that there is a plan afoot to move general surgery of an elective nature from the very fine operational and surgical facilities available in Mullingar to Tullamore General Hospital as and from 15 June.  I am unsure whether this is a done deal or a concluded plan or if it is simply speculation but, as a Labour Party representative of the people who has continually championed the cause of this important hospital in every forum available to me and at every opportunity, I make no apologies to the Government and the HSE for doing so again this evening and for seeking straight answers to the queries raised.</P>
        <P>I seek an assurance that there are no plans to remove the important service of general surgery from this hospital for any period, no matter how short, because we have had a bad experience already with the HSE in respect of how it operates services at our hospital.  Generally, we wake up and find that they are gone, moved by stealth, notwithstanding numerous assurances that no such move was planned or contemplated.</P>
        <P>I refer to the speculation concerning our general surgery facilities.  Even if it is planned to move them to Tullamore for the summer period or another short period, I hereby launch a pre-emptive strike on behalf of the people.  We in Longford-Westmeath want no diminution or dilution of the excellent service we have in the hospital, provided by excellent and competent staff and professionals who work remarkably hard to ensure we are well looked after.  Let us consider what the position would be were there any truth to the speculation or any basis in fact.  There is no direct public transport service for the people of Mullingar to Tullamore, but <Col N="692"/>that pales into insignificance when one considers the distance a patient who might require surgery would have to travel from north Longford if the surgery service was relocated to Tullamore.  Certain people in the Government might reply that we are over-reacting but we have been burned too often in the past.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to some illustrative examples to set out the situation.  This hospital should have had phase 2A completed in 1997 and was to have phase 2B completed at various times in the past decade.  The shell of phase 2B was completed in 1997.  Then, for the purposes of delay and obfuscation, phase 2B was subdivided into stages 1 and 2, with stage 2 to include a new, acute psychiatric department or unit to be built as part of the phase 2B capital programme for Mullingar Regional Hospital.  This has been scrapped and reneged upon by the HSE without batting an eyelid, despite the solemn commitment given that the plan would proceed.  Stage 2 of phase 2B also had as a target that the bed complement would increase to 313 beds.  Despite this being clearly set out in the original plan, it was subject to a further independent cost benefit analysis by the national hospital capital steering committee in November and December of 2008.  This is another objective or target which has not been met and which, in fact, has been widely missed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the question the people of Longford-Westmeath repeatedly ask me and my Labour Party colleagues.  Why are we being treated as second class citizens by this Government, which has been in power continuously since 1997, despite the consistent performance of the Midlands Regional Hospital, Mullingar, as one of the top three hospitals in this country?  Whenever a decision is made, the Government and the HSE in the midlands always seem to favour Tullamore or some other place which has ministerial influence in preference to Mullingar.  I will always argue for resources and support expenditure for other midland hospitals, especially in Tullamore, where the residents avail of the excellent orthopaedic and ear, nose and throat facilities at that hospital.  However, the people of Mullingar and Longford seek to ensure we get our fair share.  We are suspicious that the aim of the HSE is to regionalise services and to engage in grandiose reconfiguration.  If the HSE wishes to reconfigure then, in the words of Dr. Ron Charles, clinical director, Midlands Regional Hospital, Mullingar, &ldquo;Mullingar should be in the driving seat, as the figures for Mullingar hospital speak for themselves&rdquo;.  Mullingar Regional Hospital sees more than 92,000 patients for scans and X-rays, thanks to the excellent team of three consultant radiologists and one locum, led by Dr. Hugh Logan.  We have one of the best paediatric and maternity facilities in the country, with almost 3,000 babies delivered in 2009 and a rate of Caesarean section of less than 23%.  There is the potential to develop this into a maternity centre of excellence which could deliver up to 5,000 babies per year.</P>
        <P>The general surgery services, to which I have referred previously, are excellent and the hospital has the potential to become a major centre for day surgery, with the potential to take patients from Dublin.  The hospital is located on the N4 and is only major hospital facility between Dublin and Sligo.  The hospital operates very efficiently.  However, it is being deliberately starved of resources.  For example, some 41 acute beds were taken our of service late last year, a matter I raised in the D&aacute;il, and have never been restored.  Why did that happen considering the accident and emergency department is continuously overcrowded and the excellent staff working flat out, beyond the call of duty at all times, and having to contend with people placed on trolleys while these beds lie idle and unused?  What sort of mindset in the HSE or the Government would allow such a situation to develop and not take appropriate action to remedy it?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should examine the 2009 figures which are very revealing.  The number of acute hospital beds in Mullingar was 185, the total of day beds was 14, the total inpatient and day care capacity was 199 beds, the average length of stay was 3 days, the number of in-<Col N="693"/>patient discharges was 18,866, the day cases outturn was 7,235, the number of accident and emergency attendances was 32,841, the number of outpatient attendances was 74,053 and there was a budget of &euro;64.66 million, which has been reduced to &euro;59 million this year, including &euro;2.9 million for casemix adjustment.</P>
        <P>We will be protesting on Saturday, 12 June 2010 in Mullingar.  We seek to protect, enhance and maintain the facilities we have in place.  We demand that the Minister and the HSE make no attempt to downgrade the Midlands Regional Hospital, Mullingar; that the 24 hour accident and emergency facility should be retained and enhanced with the extra beds provided to accommodate the numbers of people requiring admission thereto; that all existing services at the Midlands Regional Hospital, Mullingar be retained and enhanced; and that this important hospital should get its appropriate and fair share of resources including additional staff and money.  This is what we deserve and we will accept no less.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question assumes that there is to be a withdrawal of surgical services at Mullingar hospital.  The Minister has been advised by the HSE that at present there are no plans to relocate surgical services from Mullingar hospital to Tullamore hospital.  Decisions on the allocation of resources and the prioritisation of service provision at regional level are a matter for the HSE.</P>
        <P>The Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar is part of the Dublin-midlands hospital group.  The aim of the hospital is to deliver a quality driven, people centred service to the population of Dublin and the midlands and in particular the Longford-Westmeath area.  The hospital in Mullingar operates on a 24 hour, seven day week basis.</P>
        <P>Mullingar hospital, in common with all other agencies, is required to manage its services within the approved allocation and to run its services within the approved employment ceiling.  The hospital has been recognised as being one of the most efficient in the country in the context of the annual case mix adjustment.</P>
        <P>Patient safety is of paramount concern to the HSE across the hospital system.  An issue which is currently being addressed by the HSE which is relevant to this situation is a shortage of junior doctors, or non-consultant hospital doctors, that exists in some parts of the country.  This situation may become more acute in some areas from early July.  A recruitment drive for a new intake of non-consultant hospital doctors is under way and a number of other initiatives are being considered so as to ensure that hospitals continue to offer a high level of care to all patients.  Given that this recruitment process is still ongoing, it is too early to say which hospitals and what parts of the country might be affected and to what degree.</P>
        <P>However, local management are working with clinical directors in a planned way to devise contingency arrangements which can be implemented in hospitals if and as required.  The HSE is also putting in place a number of processes to address the issues contributing to this difficulty on a short, medium and long-term basis.</P>
        <P>The Minister remains confident that the issues referred to above will be addressed by the HSE and that services at the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar will continue to be designed to deliver the best and most appropriate services to all of its patients.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A Cheann Comhairle, I first raised this matter after a visit to the Labour Party advice centre that I run on Saturdays by a young student, Naoise McDonagh, on 30 January 2010.  On 10 February, you allowed me to raise the matter on the Adjournment. <Col N="694"/> The same Minister of State was here on that evening.  I pointed out the consequences of removing support, as had been announced in the budget, from those who had a reasonable expectation that they had started on the reconstruction of their lives.  Students who had taken an access course to prepare themselves for a degree course had every expectation that, if they were successful in the, sometimes, difficult task of getting through the access course, they could proceed to an undergraduate course.  Suddenly, and half way through their access course, they were told they could not receive the back to education allowance as well as their unemployment benefit or allowance.</P>
        <P>They were, of course, devastated.  I raised the matter on 10 February.  They came to the Joint Committee on Education and Science on 20 May 2010 and made a positive proposal based on the simple fact that a person who is a graduate has a much better chance of becoming employed than a person who is not.  They presented a researched proposal of what the savings to the State would be by making people like themselves more employable.  The joint committee appeared to agree with them but the only concession that could be made was that individual hardship cases might be considered by the Minister for Social Protection. Here I am on 27 May, raising this issue again.  What message does this give?</P>
        <P>Appearing before the joint committee, the spokesperson gave three examples.  The first was a woman with five children who does a round trip of 80 km to go back to education and reconstruct her life.  The second was a man with three children who is doing the same thing and the third was a single man of 27.  The 27 year old man said he had worked as a construction worker, found he was able to understand complex tasks and decided that, perhaps, he should go back and improve himself and qualify.  He did that through the access course.  Half way through the access course he was told he would not get the student maintenance grant and the back to education allowance.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, when responding to our letter regarding the drawing of ministerial pensions by Members of the Oireachtas when we proposed a single action that would affect everyone, said people had a reasonable expectation of a benefit to which they had contributed.  These students had a reasonable expectation that, having gone to the access course, they could continue to a third level course and qualify.</P>
        <P>Of 200 recently surveyed, between the Galway Mayo Institute of Technology and the National University of Ireland Galway, 100 suggested that they may drop out.  What message does that send?  In February, the Minister of State read a statement on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and made reference to the four different sources of assistance the State gives to students.  There is a &euro;5 million student assistance fund for distressed students which covers 170,000 students.  In Galway alone last year, 800 students applied for assistance and 400 got some form of assistance.  The idea of saying that because that fund is there one can scrap this opportunity of returning to qualification is nonsense.</P>
        <P>Let us look at what the students themselves suggested, for example, a mature student supplement.  I think the Minister of State is a practical person.  Consider a person who is receiving &euro;196 per week, has dependants and must travel to avail of education.  The man who came to me last week travels to college from a place in the middle of Connemara where there is no bus service.  He has gone through all the difficulty of getting half way through his course and takes the extra cost of travel.  One might say he can get a &euro;500 book allowance, but this is all nonsense.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to encourage those students who go to the trouble of going back to education, often having the experience of unemployment in the construction industry, <Col N="695"/>rather than penalise them and force them to finance their education out of their meagre &euro;196 per week.  This is so outrageous.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to thank the Deputy for giving me this opportunity to outline the position of the Department of Education and Skills regarding changes announced in the budget in relation to student maintenance grants for those also availing of the back to education allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the House that the Department of Education and Skills funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees&rsquo; scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>This is, verbatim, the answer given on 10 February.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding on behalf of the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister changes but the script remains the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The higher education grant scheme is administered by local authorities.  There are three schemes administered by the vocational education committees.  Under the terms of the maintenance grant schemes, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment.</P>
        <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the workforce.  Eligibility for the back to education allowance, BTEA, and associated payments is determined and administered by the Department of Social Protection and is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, in the context of the current economic circumstances, difficult choices had to be made by the Government in order to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  It was decided to discontinue the practice of allowing students to hold both the BTEA and a student maintenance grant simultaneously as this represents a duplication of income support payments.  It was decided to discontinue the practice of allowing students to hold both the back-to-education allowance and a student maintenance grant simultaneously as this represents a duplication of income support payments.</P>
        <P>From September 2010, as announced in the budget, all new applicants who are in receipt of the back-to-education allowance for all schemes, and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses, will be ineligible for student maintenance grants.  However, the cost of the student services charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met, for eligible students, by the Exchequer on their behalf.  Students should apply to their assessing authority to have their eligibility assessed.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, students currently in receipt of the back-to-education allowance are not automatically entitled to a maintenance grant.  However, all students, currently in receipt of the back-to-education allowance or VTOS allowances and the maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course provided that they continue to meet the terms and conditions of the schemes.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="696"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>But not those on the Access course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Students progressing to a new course, with effect from the 2010-11 academic year, will no longer be eligible for student maintenance grants in addition to back-to-education allowance or VTOS support, but can apply for assistance under the student grant schemes towards the cost of the student services charge and any fees payable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It was part of the undergraduate preparation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Access courses are generally organised by individual institutions and are not approved courses under the terms and conditions of the student grant schemes.  The Higher Education Authority recently estimated the number of students currently on full-time Access courses at some 369.</P>
        <P>As these are not approved courses, students on Access courses in the 2009-10 academic year would not be in receipt of a student maintenance grant.  In addition, progression from an Access course to a degree course is not a continuation of the same course and therefore students progressing from an Access course to an approved course&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is pure theology now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;would not be eligible to hold the back-to-education allowance and a student maintenance grant for the 2010-11 academic year onwards.</P>
        <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance fund.  The objective of the fund is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>There is &euro;5 million for 170,000 students.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.  Some &euro;5 million is available through this fund, which is disbursed at college level.  Information on the fund is available from the Access officer at a candidate&rsquo;s college.</P>
        <P>Regarding the recent presentation made at the Joint Committee on Education and Science by Access students, I understand it was proposed that the recommendations made by the visiting delegation be sent to the Ministers for Social Protection, Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, and Education and Skills.   When these recommendations are received, I am sure that responses will issue as appropriate.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 40 together.</P>
        <P>On foot of a Government Decision, taken in February 2006, to transfer the administration of the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme (SHAE) from the Health Service Executive (HSE) to the local authority sector, a revised suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability was implemented on 1 November, 2007. The revised schemes target available resources to those in most need, streamline operational and administrative procedures and ensure equity and consistency of operation across all local authority areas.  In order to facilitate transitional arrangements, it was agreed between my Department and the HSE that the SHAE scheme would be discontinued from 1 August 2008 and that the HSE would process and approve the applications on hand at that date. My Department agreed to recoup the full cost of all such grant payments to the HSE. All new applications in respect of grant assistance for home repairs and improvements with effect from 1 August 2008 would <Col N="698"/>be directed to the local authorities and dealt with under the provisions of the Housing Aid for Older People scheme.</P>
        <P>My Department provided a total of &euro;14.7 million to the HSE in 2008 for the operation of the SHAE scheme. In July 2009, following detailed consultation with the HSE, my Department provided a further &euro;3.5 million in respect of the remaining claims on hand in all HSE regions. The Dublin Mid-Leinster region received an allocation of &euro;0.5 million, the full amount sought by the HSE. It is a matter for the HSE to apportion funding within regions.</P>
        <P>The HSE did not advise my Department of any requirement for additional funding in 2010 in respect of those applications on hand prior to 1 August, 2008. In light of this and on the understanding that all outstanding grant claims would be met from the 2009 allocation, no provision was made for an allocation to the HSE in 2010. Having regard to the continued priority which the Government attaches to the suite of housing adaptation grants and the high level of demand across all local authorities, on 5 March 2010, I announced a record Exchequer allocation of some &euro;80 million to the local authorities for spending on the grant schemes this year.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> the position regarding the statement in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 that a number of contracts and schemes in the programme address the requirement for capacity increases, particularly in gateways and hubs and other developing areas; if these contracts have been reviewed in view of the current slowdown in construction; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22227/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 aims to prioritise contracts and schemes that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth as envisaged in the Government&rsquo;s policy document Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy &mdash; A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal. The preparation of the programme involved a complete review of all schemes which had not substantially progressed to ensure that they remained priorities in the light of these programme objectives.</P>
        <P>In line with this strategic approach, the development of the Programme took into account the 2008 Forfas Report &mdash; Assessment of Water and Wastewater Services for Enterprise, which had recommended prioritisation of investment for key centres likely to require additional water and wastewater treatment capacity in the coming years. The Programme also took into account the need to support economic development of Gateways and Hubs, including developing areas in those locations, in accordance with the National Spatial Strategy.   It is important that work progresses on these contracts and schemes to maximise the development potential of the areas involved when the economy recovers.</P>
        <P>Projects were not included in the Programme if they were proposed simply for capacity expansion which was unrelated to the National Spatial Strategy/developing areas priorities, and which in the case of water supply could be deferred, in many cases, in favour of accelerated water conservation measures.  In both the development of the Programme, and in the further detailed appraisal of schemes to progress through planning, the impact of future population and capacity projections to be incorporated into the updated Regional Planning Guidelines is also taken into account.  The impact of the slowdown in construction has increased the potential for greater value for money in a more competitive tendering environment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>To comprehensively assess the overall level of demand for grant assistance under the suite of Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability, my Department requested local authorities to submit details of their funding requirements for 2010 by 22 January, with a view to determining the allocations for this year as soon as possible after the publication of the 2010 Revised Estimates for Public Service.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the continued priority which the Government attaches to these schemes and the high level of demand across all local authorities, I approved a record Exchequer allocation of &euro;80 million to the local authorities on 5 March, 2010. It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the individual schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within their allocation.  The overall level of Exchequer funding sought by Local Authorities for spending in 2010 was &euro;92.650 million. On the basis of the January returns from the local authorities, some 13,000 applications had been submitted for approval under the suite of Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability, of which some 4,430 relate to adaptation works to meet the needs of persons with a disability.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 23 together.</P>
        <P>In December 2009, following a decision by Government, I informed the House that I would be bringing forward proposals for the installation of water meters in households served by public water supplies. These proposals, which my Department is now finalising, will give effect to the commitment in the renewed Programme for Government to introduce charging for domestic water in a way that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied. I expect to bring these proposals to Government in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Article 9 of the Water Framework Directive requires Member States to have in place water pricing policies to provide adequate incentives for users to use water services efficiently. Article 9 also states that a Member State will not be in breach of the Directive if it decides, in accordance with established practices at the time of adoption of the Directive, not to apply the pro<Col N="700"/>visions of Article 9 for a given water use. The Government&rsquo;s Water Pricing Policy at the time of the adoption of the Directive in October 2000, which required local authorities to recover the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes, was considered to be consistent with the requirements of Article 9.</P>
        <P>The process of making river basin management plans in accordance with the Water Framework Directive for the period up to 2015 is well advanced with final plans to be adopted by the middle of this year.  The Directive is concerned with establishing a framework for the protection and sustainable use of water, based on the long-term protection of available water resources.  The introduction of metered water charges will lead to a more sustainable use of water resources and is, therefore, consistent with the Directive&rsquo;s key objectives.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognise that a significant proportion of complaints received by the Environmental Protection Agency relate to odour problems at licensed waste facilities.  A range of measures are being pursued to address these issues, including significant enforcement efforts, the revision of waste licences to require odour management plans, and the publication of guidelines setting minimum acceptable pre-treatment criteria for municipal solid waste being landfilled.  Furthermore, the Food Waste Regulations, which I made last December and which come into effect in July, will reduce significantly the level of biodegradable waste being landfilled. On foot of these measures, I do not consider that further legislation is needed in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where non-compliance is detected, an escalating series of enforcement actions, from ongoing communication to warning letters, legal notices and ultimately, Court proceedings are utilised.  EPA resources are managed and directed on an ongoing basis to focus the enforcement effort to where the risks or potential risks are highest and a combination of enforcement tools is used to bring about changes in environmental performance. In response to complaints relating to landfill odours, the EPA has undertaken a number of actions, including use of site agents, communication with residents&rsquo; groups and other stakeholders, and assessment of the landfill gas management systems employed.  Full details are contained in the Focus on Environmental Enforcement In Ireland report in respect of the years 2006-2008, which is available on the EPA website, <i>www.epa.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 21 and 201 together.</P>
        <P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure over that period. The timing of the commencement of contracts within that period is a matter for the Water Services Authorities and I encourage authorities to expedite the progression of contracts.  In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s Water Pricing Policy, the marginal capital cost of providing water services infrastructure to the non-domestic sector is funded by that sector. Pending the receipt of funds from the non-domestic sector in respect of such works, local authorities fund the works themselves through the proceeds of development levies or access to borrowing.</P>
        <P>I recently approved borrowing proposals amounting to &euro;141 million for 2010 to meet the needs of authorities in relation to water services schemes, either completed or currently in progress. Within the limits set in the context of the General Government Balance, the availability of access to borrowing on an annualised basis for schemes in progress effectively ensures that Water Services Authorities have access to borrowing for water services schemes when it is required. As such, access to borrowing should not be a delaying factor in the progression of water services infrastructure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of re-housing tenants where a lease expires is not a new one. Under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), which has been in place since 2004, contracts are usually for a period of 4 years. The experience to date, under the RAS, is that the vast majority of contracts are renewed at the end of the contract period and in current market conditions the new rent agreed is generally lower than in the original availability agreement.</P>
        <P>Under the leasing initiative, the lease is for a longer period than for RAS. The minimum lease period in respect of privately owned properties is ten years and it may be up to twenty years.   At the end of the lease period there will be a number of options available to the local authority to meet the social housing needs of the household. These include, renewing the lease, purchasing the unit (if an option to purchase clause has been included in the lease agreement or if the owner is willing) and taking it into social housing stock, providing the household with alternative accommodation suitable to its needs or supporting the household to purchase another dwelling under the Incremental Purchase Scheme.</P>
        <P>Within a broader policy context the housing authority, in planning for the end of the lease period for properties in a particular area, has to consider the balance of social housing demand and supply in the area and have regard to the principles of sustainable communities.  I am satisfied that the range of options available provide the necessary flexibility to enable housing authorities to meet the needs of individual households in a fair and cost effective manner <Col N="702"/>and to discharge their broader responsibilities for providing social housing support in their functional areas.</P>

	<P>My Department published statutory Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas (Cities, Towns and Villages) in December 2008.  The Guidelines are accompanied by an Urban Design manual which sets out practical examples and best practice.  The Guidelines state that sustainable neighbourhoods should be guided by the principle of universal design, whereby the urban environment is designed so that it can be accessed, understood and used by all people regardless of their age, size, ability and disability.  The need for street design to incorporate the needs of people with disabilities is also highlighted.  In relation to these and other access and inclusivity issues, the Guidelines recommend that planning authorities should consult the National Disability Authority&rsquo;s guidance on universal design of the built and external environment.</P>
        <P>Last year my Department published the Government Policy on Architecture 2009-2015 which sets out the key areas for development in urban design and architecture.  It promotes standards of excellence in the design of shared space, which includes aspects of universal design and accessibility.  The documents referred to above are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.  My Department is also working in conjunction with the Department of Transport on a Manual for Streets which will address design guidance and standards for streetscapes and related shared space, and will be guided by universal design and accessibility principles.</P>

	<P>Sections 34(4)(g) and 180(2)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provide that a planning authority may attach a condition to a planning permission, requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of a development, and, if the development is not subsequently completed satisfactorily, may apply the security to that satisfactory completion.  My Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter PD 1/08 on Taking in Charge of Residential Developments / Management Arrangements states that planning authorities must take all necessary measures, in particular through securing adequate bonds, inspection of construction and enforcement action, when necessary, to ensure that developers complete residential developments to a standard that is in compliance with the planning permission granted.</P><Col N="703"/>
        <P>In relation to bonds, the circular states that, in the case of residential development, planning conditions must require the giving of sufficient security prior to commencement of development and that planning authorities must ensure that they are in a position to draw down the security in cases where a developer fails satisfactorily to complete a residential development or phase of a development, within the specified period.</P>
        <P>The circular also states that the amount of the security, and the terms on which it is required to be given, must enable the planning authority, without cost to itself, to complete the necessary services (including roads, footpaths, water mains, sewers, lighting and open space) to a satisfactory standard in the event of default by the developer and that the security condition must also provide for the recalculation of the amount specified in the condition by reference to the House Building Cost Index (or the Consumer Price Index), if the development to which the permission relates is not commenced within a specified period after the granting of the permission.</P>
        <P>My Department is progressing a range of actions, with the cooperation of local authorities and other key stakeholders, to address the issue of unfinished or unoccupied estates.  These actions include in the first instance an accurate quantification, classification and mapping of the various types of unfinished or unoccupied estates on a county by county basis to understand the scale and distribution of the problem.  Following completion of a pilot exercise with one local authority, a comprehensive national inventory is now under way and should be completed in the middle of the year.</P>
        <P>My Department is also preparing a best practice policy manual which aims to identify the necessary responses to ensure satisfactory outcomes in tackling difficulties on specific sites in a co-ordinated and pro-active manner.  The responses will require a range of interventions across a number of disciplines &mdash; there are issues of public safety, the provision of bonds and securities, environmental protection, building control and estate management.  It is a matter for the National Asset Management Agency to consider how it deals with unfinished and incomplete estates that come within its remit.</P>

My Department has met with a broad range of interested parties in regard to the shape that such a register might take, including representatives from the Department of Finance, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Property Services Regulatory Authority, Central Statistics Office, Property Registration Authority, Revenue Commissioners, Law Reform Commission, Law Society and the Institute of Auctioneers and Valuers of Ireland.  Recommendations arising from this process will be made to Government shortly.

	<P>Under the Social Housing Leasing Initiative, local authorities may include an option to purchase the lease dwellings within the lease contract, which means where this clause is invoked it will provide tenants with the opportunity to purchase the units that they are currently occupying from the local authority. To date, the majority of privately owned leased properties that have been agreed or are currently being negotiated have or are including an option to purchase clause. The Department is also examining the potential for tenants in some instances to be able to purchase the unit they are occupying directly from the owner.  In addition, the recently announced Incremental Purchase Scheme will provide the opportunity for a household in a leased property to move to, and purchase, a dwelling provided by a housing authority or an approved housing body under the scheme and to avail of the relevant subsidies and discounts. </P>

	<P>Road safety is a matter for the Minister for Transport and the Road Safety Authority and one in which I have no function.  In relation to motor tax, liability on a vehicle arises when the vehicle is first used in a public place following registration of the vehicle by the Revenue Commissioners and assignment of Irish number plates.  It is an offence to use an untaxed mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and enforcement is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  My Department is currently examining the legislation governing the operation of the motor tax system with a view to ensuring that the system can operate as efficiently and effectively as possible.

	<P>The Programme for Government, agreed in 2007, contains a commitment to the establishment of an independent Electoral Commission which will take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight, implement modern and efficient electoral practices, revise constituency boundaries, take charge of compiling a new national rolling Electoral Register, take over the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission relating to election spending and examine the issue of financing the political system.</P>
        <P>The renewed Programme for Government, agreed in October 2009, reaffirms this commitment and states that an independent Electoral Commission will incorporate the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission, with enhanced powers of inspection.  The renewed Programme sets out the following responsibilities which the Commission will be mandated to fulfil: to decide the constituency boundaries; administer the voting registration process; run voter education programmes; advise on mechanisms to increase the participation of women in political life, including the use of additional criteria for public funding which encourages more women and lesser represented groups; and recommend revised guidelines on the declaration of donations for political purposes.</P>
        <P>In addition, the renewed Programme states that, within 12 months, the  Commission will also propose reforms to the electoral system, including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />make recommendations on the feasibility of extending the franchise for Presidential Elections to the Irish abroad;</P>

This should include the possibility of &lsquo;mid-term&rsquo; elections and running some elections on a &lsquo;staggered or &lsquo;rolled&rsquo; basis so that elections do not fall on the same day for every candidate or chamber.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">Towards implementing the Government Programme commitments, and to assist in consideration of the issues involved, I commissioned a report by an expert group from University College Dublin.

The report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.environ.ie</i> and I will still welcome and consider any views and observations that are put forward by interested individuals and organisations.</P>
        <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution is currently undertaking an examination of the system used for the election of members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, and in the course of this work has considered issues in respect of the administration and functioning of Ireland&rsquo;s electoral system generally.

	<P>The ten-year derogation has come to an end for 32 raised bog Special Areas of Conservation. The derogation will end for further sites at the end of 2011 and 2013.  It is clear from the scientific evidence available to me that there has been a continued loss of protected habitat on these bogs that can only be effectively halted and reversed through further restrictions on turf cutting and associated drainage on these sites. The working group which I established to advise on necessary arrangements to protect designated raised bogs has met with turf cutters&rsquo; representative organizations and conservation interests in order to hear their views, and these are being taken into account in the finalisation of the arrangements involved.</P>

Substantial work has been undertaken by the Department of Finance, in consultation with other Departments, to review capital investment priorities, taking account of the new economic and budgetary realities.  This process is nearing completion and I expect the review, when published, to include the capital expenditure envelope for my Department to 2016.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 209 together.</P>
        <P>Following the Government decision not to proceed with implementation of electronic voting in Ireland, an Interdepartmental Task Force, chaired by my Department, was established to bring the project to an orderly conclusion and to oversee disposal of the equipment and termination of storage arrangements.  To date, the Task Force has met four times, with its most recent meeting taking place in March 2010.  Between meetings, my Department maintains ongoing contact with members of the Task Force, in order to progress work on the cessation arrangements for the project.  While the Task Force has not, at this stage, invited proposals in respect of the equipment, some expressions of interest have been received in the course of its work.  The Task Force aims to complete its work as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach, with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of cost possible in the circumstances, consistent with environmental and other obligations.  Detailed consideration of all relevant factors is underway to inform the manner in which disposal of the machines will be effected.  This includes contact with the original suppliers of the machines.</P>

	<P>Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC, which were transposed into Irish law by regulations made by the Minister for Finance, allow for environmental and social criteria and conditions to be integrated into public procurement procedures. Such criteria and conditions may, therefore, be included in the selection of technical specifications and award criteria, and in contract performance clauses.  Accordingly, my Department&rsquo;s publication Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities<i> &mdash; </i>the best practice guidance accompanying the Government&rsquo;s housing <Col N="710"/>policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities &mdash; states that: &ldquo;Materials such as timber used in construction should be obtained from sustainably managed sources&rdquo;. </P>
        <P>At EU level, the current emphasis is on ensuring that all timber entering the EU comes from legal sources. To this end, a new EU Regulation will require timber traders operating in the EU for the first time to operate &ldquo;due diligence&rdquo; systems as a further barrier to trade in illegal timber. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who has responsibility in this area, is negotiating this Regulation on behalf of Ireland. The provisions of this Regulation, when adopted, will be reflected in the Green Public Procurement National Action Plan being prepared by my Department, in co-operation with the National Procurement Service in the Office of Public Works, and which will be published for consultation shortly.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Green Public Procurement National Action Plan will recommend that public authorities verify that the timber they procure is both legal and sustainable. This may be demonstrated through any of the widely-recognised existing commercial certification systems, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes (PEFC), the Canadian Standards Association scheme (CSA), and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI). Under the above-cited EU public procurement directives, any other appropriate form of proof and verification that timber is legal and sustainable must also be accepted.</P>

	<P>Recognising that people with disabilities have particular needs, my Department endeavours to ensure that the voting process is as accessible and inclusive as possible. Currently there are two options available to assist voters with a visual impairment to vote at their local polling station; they may avail of companion voting or they may seek the assistance of the presiding officer. Other measures in place to assist such voters include the display of a large print version of the ballot paper in polling stations and the inclusion of candidates&rsquo; photographs and party emblems on the ballot paper.</P>
        <P>My Department is committed, as set out in our Disability Sectoral Plan 2010-2012, to examine the legislative, logistical and financial implications of independent voting, including voting by blind and visually impaired persons. In this context, my Department has met with representatives of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland and is considering a range of options including the use of tactile ballot templates like those in use in other jurisdictions. As with any review of electoral practice, it is necessary to ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained between accessibility and the secrecy and integrity of the ballot, having regard to our electoral system.</P>

	<P>Enforcement actions against illegal waste activity are a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE).  The 2005 report of the OEE, The Nature and Extent of Unauthorised Waste Activity in Ireland, identified the unauthorised collection and fly-tipping of waste as a problem area which needed to be further tackled. The extent of fly-tipping is not, however, quantified in the report. The report drew attention to the measures already being taken, including the appointment of some one hundred and twenty additional enforcement officers funded by my Department across the local authorities and the stepped up enforcement activity generally being led by the OEE and the local authorities. It also identified additional actions which would further support the effort to stamp out this socially and environmentally unacceptable practice, such as a &ldquo;man in the van&rdquo; advertisement campaign and use of covert cameras. Non-routine actions are now commonplace, and include vehicle checkpoints and use of CCTV cameras for identification of offenders at fly-tipping hotspots. The implementation of these actions is coordinated on an ongoing basis by the OEE through its National Enforcement Network.</P>
        <P>In 2008, there were 19,269 routine litter patrol investigations, 27,825 on the spot fines issued and 608 litter prosecutions. In addition, 12,000 non-litter waste complaints inspections and a further 2,434 other inspections for fly-tipping waste, burning or other surveillance purposes were undertaken by the local authorities. There were 8,151 waste enforcement notices issued and 695 prosecutions initiated but a breakdown as to how many of these related to fly-tipping is not available. Overall, this represents a very significant quantum of enforcement, consistent with the findings of the OEE&rsquo;s Focus on Environmental Enforcement in Ireland, covering the period 2006 to 2008, which indicates that the handling of waste-related complaints has significantly improved.  Notwithstanding the significant progress achieved, I intend shortly to set up a multi agency task force to consider the matter further, with a view to determining any additional actions that may be required.</P>

	<P>In April 2009 my Department commenced a review of the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, under which the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) operates. The purpose of this review was to consider whether the Act best supported the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions and whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.</P>
        <P>I announced the preliminary outcomes of the review in November 2009; they include recommendations in a number of key areas, and have an overall emphasis on streamlining and simplifying the Act and reducing delays. Among the main issues that will be addressed by the amending legislation are&mdash;</P><Col N="712"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a statutory objective of 6 months to be set for the issuing of determination orders arising out of dispute resolution applications,</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />measures to address non-payment of rent by tenants during a dispute process, in particular to introduce scope for the legal termination of such a tenancy,</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the inclusion within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act of segments of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector that most closely parallel its current remit.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A number of issues requiring further research, including third party complaints under the Act, the Act&rsquo;s engagement with anti-social behaviour matters and how best to address issues surrounding the retention of deposits, are also being considered in detail.</P>
        <P>The Government recently approved the preparation of Heads of the Bill which will also address a number of amendments to housing legislation which it was not possible to finalise in the context of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. It is envisaged that the General Scheme of the Bill setting out the detailed proposals arising from the review will be submitted to Government in Autumn 2010, with publication of the Bill dependent on the time subsequently required for drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>

	<P>During 2007, water services authorities were asked by my Department to review the operation of all water treatment plants (and associated infrastructure) and to ensure that the installation of continuous chlorine alarms and turbidity meters at appropriate locations at the treatment plant or in the distribution network (including at reservoirs) is progressed without delay.  This request was restated in August 2008 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) who issued a circular to water services authorities recommending the installation of a chlorine monitor and alarm in each public water supply.  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No.2) Regulations 2007, the EPA is responsible for the supervision of public water supplies.</P>
        <P>The installation of chlorine monitors and alarms on public schemes by water services authorities was one of the measures which led the European Commission to close infringement proceedings against Ireland arising from a European Court of Justice Ruling in 2002 in relation to the quality of drinking water supplies.

        <P>Last year, local authorities carried out assessments of needs in response to my Department&rsquo;s request, in July 2009, to the authorities to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital water services works in their areas.  As part of those assessments, local authorities were requested to consider the steps necessary to meet the 2013 parametric value for the presence of lead in drinking water, based on the approach outlined by the EPA in its Lead Guidance Circular No. 2 of 21 April 2009, and to formulate proposals, where appropriate, for mains rehabilitation to replace lead connections.</P><Col N="714"/>
        <P>The local authority assessments were a key input to the development of my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.   Mains rehabilitation, including the replacement of eligible lead pipes and connections, is a key priority under the new Programme, which will build on existing local authority investment in water conservation by providing for a very substantial scaling up of activity on mains rehabilitation.  My aim is to increase substantially investment in water conservation to provide for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &euro;300 million over the next three years.   This level of activity will continue to address the problem of lead pipes or connections in public water supply networks.  The phasing and funding of mains rehabilitation works for each local authority are set out in the published Programme &mdash; information regarding the location of those projects may be had from the relevant local authority.</P>

	<P>I am committed to the establishment of a GM free zone in Ireland as set out in the Programme for Government. No GM food products are currently cultivated in Ireland.  In respect of the cultivation and sale of GM products, there is a community authorisation procedure in place, enabling the competent authority of each Member State to contribute to the decision-making process. In Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency is the competent authority. This authorisation procedure, however, also means that, when a product is approved, no geographical restrictions apply within the EU and no additional domestic approval is required.</P>
        <P>The European Commission recently announced that it will bring forward a proposal to allow more choice to individual Member States in deciding whether or not to cultivate GMOs in their respective territories. I welcome this initiative, which reflects the clear message conveyed by a number of Member States, including Ireland, that the current system is no longer sufficient and is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Meeting the requirements of the Landfill Directive is a key national priority in respect of waste management and I am committed to implementing the measures necessary to ensure that Ireland meets the 2010, and subsequent, EU landfill diversion targets. Data from the National Waste Report 2008, published by the EPA, show that the quantity of biodegradable municipal waste disposed of to landfill decreased by 19% in 2008 to approximately 1.2 million tonnes, requiring Ireland to divert a further 280,000 tonnes in order to meet the first Landfill Directive target due in July 2010.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive circular letter (WPPR 17/08) issued to each local authority in July 2008 requesting that appropriate steps be taken to support an accelerated roll out of segregated collections for organic waste (&lsquo;brown bins&rsquo;) both to domestic households and to commercial organisations.  Such bins could be provided directly by local authorities where the local authorities remain in the business of waste collection or, alternatively, utilising the existing waste collection permitting system where the service is provided by the private sector.  The National Waste Report 2008 provides the latest data in relation to the roll out of the brown bin. The separate kerbside collection of household food and garden waste in brown bins increased substantially from 18,705 tonnes in 2007 to 37,920 tonnes in 2008 and I would expect to see further increases reported for 2009 and into the future.</P>
        <P>The number of local authority areas where household brown bin waste was collected at kerbside increased from 13 in 2007 to 16 in 2008 mainly due to private operators offering the service.  In December 2009 I signed the Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations 2009, which are designed to promote the segregation and beneficial use of food waste arising in the commercial sector.</P>
        <P>In addition, I increased the landfill levy by the currently permitted annual maximum of &euro;5 per tonne to &euro;25 per tonne in December 2009 and to &euro;30 per tonne from 1 February 2010. This will assist in ensuring that landfill gate fees do not act as a barrier to achieving the diversion targets.  Further increases in the landfill levy are being considered in the context of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to be published later this year.  Ensuring a supportive framework for the achievement of Landfill Directive requirements is also a key consideration in my Department&rsquo;s work to prepare a new waste policy document, a draft of which I expect to publish for consultation shortly.</P>

As all expenditure incurred by the NTMA in making purchases up to the end of 2009 has been recouped by my Department, there is no surplus under subhead D4.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department received a lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 4 August, 2009.  Upon examination of the redundancy claim, it appeared that the individual concerned did not have the required class of social welfare contributions with the company.  On that basis, my Department raised a query with the Department Social Protection in relation to the individual&rsquo;s insurance class status.  I understand that a decision in this regard is expected shortly.  If it emerges that the individual does not have the necessary social welfare contributions with the company, my Department will be obliged to refuse payment of the claim.</P><Col N="718"/>

I should caution that these figures reflect the number of employees who actually qualified for statutory redundancy lump sum payments.  They do not reflect those who lost their jobs with less than two years service in employment given that these employees would not be eligible for redundancy. Redundancies reflect the turbulence in the labour market that has occurred following the unprecedented global economic downturn.  The Government&rsquo;s policies across a range of areas including banking, education and skills, innovation and enterprise development are focussed on supporting our overall national objectives of reducing unemployment, regional development and building the Smart Economy. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The relocation of businesses within particular types of industry is a reality of modern global manufacturing for a highly developed economy such as Ireland.  There are many factors which influence a firm&rsquo;s decision to relocate. Firms adjust their plant location and utilisation strategies to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, accessing technology or other competitive considerations.  The result is flows of investment and employment across borders.  For much of the last decade this type of job &ldquo;churn&rdquo; has been positive for Ireland, with companies replacing lower value activities with activities of higher value, resulting in better paid, more highly skilled jobs.</P><Col N="719"/>
        <P>It is not possible to project the extent to which job losses may arise due to firms locating abroad as the decision to relocate is due to many factors, some of which I have already outlined.   As a small, open, export led economy, our best response to the realities of globalisation is to ensure that Ireland remains attractive for investment and enterprise growth.  Our enterprise support policies have consistently evolved to meet the needs of both foreign direct investment (FDI) and growth&ndash;orientated indigenous firms.  These policies have enabled us to win many prestigious and value added investments, and have enabled us to replace lost jobs with others of equal or higher value in the economy.</P>
        <P>However, there can be no denying that current operating conditions for companies are difficult and challenging due to a number of factors, including global uncertainty in banking and finance, tough competition and the global recession.  Some issues are outside the control of Government. Nevertheless, this government has been focussing on the priorities of business, such as energy and labour costs, together with the separate issue of credit availability. We have ensured that Ireland can offer the skills, education, research and innovation capabilities that modern mobile and indigenous firms need to be competitive in world markets. These, combined with a &ldquo;can do&rdquo; attitude, an attractive living and business environment, and an active and growing R&amp;D base, will ensure that Ireland remains a location of choice for investment.</P>

	<P>The Task Force completed its Interim Report which was presented to the T&aacute;naiste by the Task Force chairman Mr Denis Brosnan last July. Since then the Government has been responding to the recommendations under the various headings. Last September, the T&aacute;naiste sent the Task Force a report on responses up to that time. Following completion of a cross-departmental consultation, taking account of Ministers&rsquo; budgets for 2010, with other Ministers and all relevant Divisions and agencies in my Department, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State made detailed Statements to the D&aacute;il on 28 January, 2010, on the issue. A summary on responses up to March, 2010, was provided in response to a Parliamentary Question.</P>
        <P>The situation in relation to responses is now being updated again and I expect to meet with Mr Brosnan in the next week or so to inform him on the current state of play in relation to the recommendations. I shall also circulate the updated response to Deputies for information.  This latest response will provide an update on the extensive multi-agency response which has been under way since the Dell-related job losses were announced, and which was augmented by the funding approved late last year under the EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</P>
        <P>The agency-delivered response provides information &amp; services to individual employees facing unemployment to facilitate them to re-train, to re-educate or to start a new business, and delivers specific initiatives to indigenous sub-supply companies in the Mid-West to explore alternative markets, products and business opportunities. Services to affected workers are delivered in particular through F&aacute;s, EI, CEBs, VECs and the education institutions.  The latest update on responses to the recommendations will also contain details of the response to all of <Col N="720"/>the recommendations on Enterprise Development, including responses delivered through IDA, Shannon Development, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards, as well as in relation to grant aid rates and the development of industrial estates in Limerick.  It will also give details on the response to the other recommendations in the Task Force Report.</P>

	<P>I can advise the Deputy that the Appeals Officer in the Employment Permits Section of my Department has been in contact with the employer requesting additional original documentation in relation to the case concerned.  On receipt of this information a decision will be made on this appeal.  Due to a necessary re-prioritisation of resources within the Department, a significant number of staff in the Employment Permits area were re-deployed to the Redundancy Payments area, where there is a strong need for additional resources to process payments to those who have lost their jobs.  This has resulted in delays in the processing of some permit types and appeals.  However, the Employment Permits Section is continuing its efforts to try and reduce this backlog within the limits of existing resource allocations.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department received a lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 25 March 2010.  This claim awaits processing.  In respect of redundancy lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from September/October 2009.  In relation to Redundancy claims, the scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />almost <b>doubling the number of staff</b> through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</P><Col N="721"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s <b>overtime budget</b> towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />establishment of a <b>special call handling facility</b> in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the <b>offset of redundancy rebate payments</b> by employers against existing outstanding tax  liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008.  During the period 1 January 2010 to 30 April, 2010, 23,593 claims were received and 27,592 were processed.  In the year to date, inroads have been made on the backlog of claims on hand, which reduced from 41,168 at the end of January to 36,333 at the end of April 2010.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Based on the projections for the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement for the years 2010 to 2014 as set out in Budget 2010, the estimated cost of interest on the national debt is approximately &euro;4&frac12; billion in 2010, &euro;5&frac34; billion in 2011, &euro;6&frac12; billion in 2012, &euro;7&frac12; billion in 2013 and &euro;7&frac34; billion in 2014.  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has advised that, as is usual, these estimates were prepared on the basis of the prevailing market conditions for Irish Government bonds and provide for expectations with regard to market movements over the forecast period.  As a technical exercise, the NTMA has estimated that the impact of a 1% increase in Ireland&rsquo;s spread (the premium which Ireland pays over the German 10-year benchmark bond) would be to add approximately &euro;200 million per annum to the full-year cost of funding this year&rsquo;s borrowing requirement of about &euro;20 billion.  This additional cost would not only impact in 2010 but would also impact over the medium-term.</P>
        <P>The NTMA has targeted a total bond issuance of some &euro;20 billion in 2010. The forecast Exchequer Borrowing Requirement for 2010 is some &euro;18.8 billion and the refinancing requirement is some &euro;1.2 billion. The NTMA had a carryover of more than &euro;5 billion from 2009 into 2010 and as of 18 May 2010 they have raised some &euro;13.2 billion from the bond market, or 66% of the funding target for the year. In addition the NTMA holds large cash balances &mdash; currently over &euro;20 billion &mdash; which allow it time its long-term issuance to take advantage of opportunities in the bond markets and to avoid periods of volatility.</P>

	<P>President Van Rompuy&rsquo;s Task Force met for the first time last Friday. I am the Irish representative on the Task Force. The work of the Task Force has only just begun, but there is a willingness by all to consider ways to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact, and to put in place an effective crisis management mechanism for dealing with the kind of problems we see today in the euro area. Ministers discussed these issues at last Friday&rsquo;s meeting and the general view was that all avenues for improvements that could be advanced quickly should be the focus.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the thrust of recent discussions in the Ecofin Council is to continue to make progress on a range of urgent and important issues in the economic and financial areas with a view to positioning the EU and euro areas to take advantage of economic recovery according as circumstances improve.  Following on from the specific loan facility which has been put in place for Greece, the Ecofin Council decided on 9 May 2010 on a wider and comprehensive package of measures in order, if needed, to financially support Member States which find themselves in difficulties caused by exceptional circumstances beyond their control.  The overriding purpose of these measures, which are supported by Ireland, is to safeguard financial stability in the EU and the euro area as a whole.    This is vitally important for the EU, the euro area and for Ireland.   The support measures consist of:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism based on a Council Regulation under Article 122 of the Treaty and providing up to &euro; 60 billion in loans or credit lines which could be very rapidly mobilised. The Regulation setting up the Mechanism has already been enacted by the Council. Activation of the Mechanism will be subject to strong conditionality, in the context of a joint EU/IMF support. When a Council Decision is made to provide a loan or credit line to a Member State in difficulties, the Commission is empowered on behalf of the European Union to contract the necessary borrowings on the capital markets or with financial institutions.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The European Financial Stability Facility, an intergovernmental agreement under which Euro Area Member States will provide guaranteed loans on a pro-rata basis of up to &euro;440 billion.     The Facility which will be set up shortly will provide loans of up to 5-year terms or credit lines via a special purpose vehicle (SPV). As I indicated last week in the course of debate on the Euro Area Loan Facility Bill 2010, which dealt with the position of Greece, further legislation will be required to allow us to participate in the wider financial support mechanism agreed by the Council.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">In all cases the costs of each loan, including principal and interest repayment, will be the responsibility of the beneficiary member state. Financial assistance is in all cases to be subject to strong policy conditionality.  The IMF have also committed to provide up to a maximum of &euro;250 billion in loans to euro area Member States on a country by country basis, in the manner that the IMF recently agreed a package with the Greek Government.</P>
        <P>The proposal for an Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive is aimed at introducing, for the first time, an EU-wide regulatory regime for the managers of alternative funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds. The proposal would introduce wide-ranging changes to the way in which the managers of these funds conduct their business.</P>
        <P>The EU&rsquo;s Finance Ministers reached unanimous agreement on the proposal at the Ecofin meeting on 18 May. The agreed text will now form the basis for negotiations with the European Parliament. However, it was noted that, notwithstanding the unanimity achieved, many <Col N="724"/>Member States still had a number of concerns which they wished to have resolved during the inter-institutional negotiations. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, we had concerns regarding the draft provisions on depositaries, valuators and in regard to the possible impact on venture capital funds and we would hope that the text that is finally agreed would address these concerns.  The negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament on the draft Directive are expected to be completed before the end of July with a view to the new regime being in place during 2012.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Standard Fund Threshold in respect of which Budget and Finance Act 2006 introduced a maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes. A limit of &euro;5 million was placed on the total capital value of pension benefits that an individual can draw upon in their lifetime from tax-relieved pension arrangements. This is known as the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT).</P>
        <P>A higher limit (the Personal Fund Threshold &mdash; PFT) was also introduced at that time for individuals whose pension fund values exceeded &euro;5 million on the date the SFT was introduced, 7 December 2005. The PFT was deemed necessary on the grounds that those individuals with pension funds in excess of &euro;5 million had built up those funds in good faith over the years while availing of tax reliefs available by reference to the law as it stood prior to the change and it would not have been possible to retrospectively deny them those reliefs.  The Finance Act 2006 also introduced indexation for both the SFT and PFT from 2007 onwards in line with an earnings factor. As a result, the value of the SFT for 2008 increased to over &euro;5.4 million. Indexation did not occur in 2009 however.</P>
        <P>On the assumption that, as with the Budget 2006 change, any reduced SFT limit would have to take account of the pension funds of individuals that had already been built up legitimately under existing arrangements that would then be above any new limit, any reduction in the SFT would be unlikely of itself to have immediate effects in terms of Exchequer savings.</P>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year gains to the Exchequer from reducing the thresholds for Capital Acquisitions Tax by the stated amounts are as set out in the following table. These estimates are based on transactions recorded in 2009.</P><Col N="725"/>
        <P>The Exchequer yield in the first year of implementation of any such changes would depend on the timing of the changes. It is assumed in the current estimates that the first year yield would be of the order of 85% of the corresponding full year amounts.  It should be noted that these estimates are based upon an assumption that there would be no behavioural impact of the changes, which could lead to a lesser, or in some circumstances, greater than expected impact on Exchequer yield. In addition, the realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets, which are currently occurring in the economy.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the amount of liabilities covered under the bank guarantee which mature before 1 October 2010, including a breakdown per participating institution; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware the original Guarantee under the Covered Institutions Financial Support Scheme (CIFS) is due to expire on 29 September.  However, a new Guarantee, the eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme (ELG) has been introduced.  Liabilities guaranteed under ELG are covered up to their maturity date, to a maximum of five years.  In addition, customer deposits up to &euro;100,000 are permanently covered under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme.  These are not included in the CIFS/ELG figures. </P>
        <P>Total liabilities covered under CIFS and ELG stood at &euro;269bn at end March 2010. No new liabilities are being guaranteed under CIFS and eligible liabilities that are new or being &ldquo;rolled over&rdquo; fall under ELG.  As of end April a total of &euro;188bn was expected to mature before 1 October.  This figure assumes demand deposits mature in the first month and notice deposits mature as if notice were given at end April.

        <Quest> further to his budget 2010 speech when he stated the yield from the carbon tax will be used to boost energy efficiency, to support rural transport and to alleviate fuel poverty, if progress has been made in ring fencing a percentage to each of the areas identified; and if not, when he anticipates that this will occur. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is estimated that the carbon tax, inclusive of VAT, will yield approximately &euro;250 million in 2010.  The revenue will, amongst other things, be used to boost energy efficiency, to support rural transport and to alleviate fuel poverty.  It is the general practice not to ring-fence revenues for specific purposes but rather take an overall view on priorities in the context of Expenditure decisions which, of course, are dependent on Exchequer revenues. In this regard revenues from the carbon tax will facilitate investment in the aforementioned areas. </P>

However, I have no plans to meet the Chancellor over the coming weeks in the context of the UK Budget planned for 22 June.

        <Quest> the basis on which benchmarking awards were extended to include pensioners; and if he will indicate whether pensioners in An Post are entitled to benchmarking awards that would have applied to parallel grades in the public service under the terms of the act establishing An Post which provided that there should be equivalents in terms and conditions for persons who were transferred to the new bodies. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Benchmarking increases were applied to public service pensioners at the time in the light of general policy of linking post-retirement increases in pensions to pay.   The Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 provided for the transfer of certain staff from the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs to An Post.  The Act also provides for not less favourable conditions in respect of their terms and conditions than those which had applied to them prior to their transfer.  The Act does not provide such staff with entitlement to the benefit of subsequent pay increases awarded to civil service and related grades.  The Deputy will be aware, that payments to An Post pensioners, are a matter for An Post itself in the first instance.  The relevant legislation is under the aegis of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Any additional bonds regardless of the currency they are issued in would have to be issued by the NTMA and as with all bonds issued <Col N="731"/>by them would add to our General Government debt.  In light of the current Government deficit situation, the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion would not be an appropriate solution for counteracting the risk of rising mortgage interest rates. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that in February I informed the Government of my proposals regarding expanding the membership of the Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Group, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney.  The Group is initially exploring the feasibility of a range of possible options and initiatives for improving the level of mortgage support to homeowners in difficulty. I expect that a final report on this phase of the review will be ready by end June 2010.</P>
        <P>It is important that a balance is achieved by Government between influencing private banks through the bank guarantee scheme and other financial support incentives while at the same time being seen to have a hands-off approach to the day to day running of these institutions which must operate on a strictly commercial basis.  I have regularly referred to the measures available for those homeowners who find themselves in difficulty.  In my Budget speech in December, I refocused mortgage interest relief on those who bought their homes at the peak of the market.  Where a homeowner&rsquo;s entitlement to mortgage interest relief would expire in 2010 or after, they will now continue to receive it up to the end of 2017.</P>
        <P>The Mortgage Interest Subsidy Scheme under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance system provides money, subject to a means test, towards the interest payments on a home mortgage.  This scheme, which is administered by the Community Welfare Service of the HSE on behalf of the Department of Social Protection provides short term support to help pay mortgage interest repayments where the mortgage relates to a person&rsquo;s principal private residence.  The number of people now benefiting from the Scheme stands in the region of 15,000.  The Scheme is currently under review by the Department of Social Protection to examine ways of improving the operation of the Scheme.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be familiar with the other supports available to homeowners, including the services provided by the Money Advice Budgeting Services (MABS) and the moratorium in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.  After my Budget speech in December, I wrote to the Financial Regulator requesting that consideration be given to extending the then 6 month moratorium out to 12 months to ease the burden on mortgage borrowers in arrears.  The Financial Regulator, after careful consideration and consultations decided to extend the moratorium to 12 months in line with my request.</P>

The draft directive seeks to ensure that a set of minimum health and safety standards for human organs intended for transplantation is in place in all member states.  The aim is firstly, to reduce the risk of infectious diseases being transmitted to the organ recipient and secondly, to enhance the efficiency of exchanging organs between member states.  Officials of my Department have participated in the negotiations at Council on this draft directive over the past year.  The draft directive will next be considered by the Council of Ministers and, subject to its approval, it is expected to enter into force later in 2010, whereupon all member states will have two years to implement the legislation.</P>

However, I would like to advise the Deputy that the scheduling of patients for hospital treatment is a matter for the consultant concerned in each case and is determined on the basis of clinical need.  Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant involved.</P>

	<P>It remains my intention to assist 20 named applicants to complete inter-country adoptions in respect of children from Vietnam on an exceptional basis and insofar as it is practicable in law. In communicating the decision to suspend the bilateral negotiations the Irish Government asked the Vietnamese Government whether it will be possible to proceed with these adoptions.  The Vietnamese response was not definitive.  The Government is attempting to put in place a mechanism in respect of these 20 applicants that safeguards against recent concerns raised in relation to inter-country adoption in Vietnam.</P>
        <P>The Government decided to suspend indefinitely negotiations on a new bilateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  This will have the effect of suspending inter-country adoption from Vietnam until such time as the Adoption Bill, 2009 has been enacted and Ireland and Vietnam have both ratified the provisions of the Hague Convention.  The Adoption Bill 2009 is currently at Report Stage and I hope will complete its passage through both Houses shortly thereafter.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health and Children, in assessing</askee>
        <Quest> the <Col N="736"/>eligibility of persons over 70 for the medical card, the reason for the provision to look at the medical condition and medical expenses of a person whose income exceeds the &euro;700 limit; and if the Health Service Executive has the discretion to grant a card in exceptional medical circumstances. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Health Act 2008, a much simplified system of assessment for eligibility was introduced in respect of persons aged 70 or over, based on the significantly higher gross income thresholds rather than the standard net income limits.  The gross income thresholds are &euro;700 per week for a single person and &euro;1,400 for a couple, as against net income limits of &euro;201.50 for a single person and &euro;298 for a couple.</P>
        <P>Under the net income assessment system, the assessment of eligibility is based on the combined income of an applicant and spouse (where applicable) after tax, PRSI and income levy contributions have been deducted.  Additional allowances may be made for rent/mortgage, travel to work and child care costs.  However, these would not be a factor for the vast majority of older people.  Where an applicant&rsquo;s income is in excess of the net income guidelines, the Health Service Executive (HSE) will take medical issues and expenses into account in determining whether or not &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo; exists.  Where a person aged 70 or over does not qualify for a medical card by virtue of their gross income being over the specified thresholds, the HSE will assess if the person qualifies for a medical card or GP visit card under the existing net income thresholds.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the above, the HSE may issue a medical card on a discretionary basis, if the applicant would otherwise be caused undue hardship in providing general medical and surgical services for himself/herself and any dependants.  To assist the HSE in making such a determination, it is necessary for the applicant to provide information about medical issues and expenses.</P>

The equipment for Malin and Valentia Marine Rescue Sub co-ordination Centres has been delivered to the Coast Guard Stores and will be activated as soon as possible.  It is important that the current ICS systems in Valentia and Malin are not changed until Dublin is complete and connected to all radio sites so that the required redundancy is available.  The Office of Public Works report on the adaptation of the buildings in Malin and Valentia to take the new configuration is awaited. It is anticipated that subject to funding work will commence on one of the Centres in late 2010 and on the other building in 2011.</P>

        <Quest> if he will report on the condition of the Dublin Airport Authority pension fund; if any proposal has been submitted by DAA for approval; if his attention has been drawn to the perceived doubtful status of the fund, the fact that pensioners have got no increase for three years and the need for a lump sum injection into the fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Irish Airlines (General Employees) Superannuation Scheme is a multi-employer scheme in which the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) is a minority company participant in the scheme.  Pension entitlements and pensions in payment under this scheme are primarily matters for the Trustees, the members of the scheme and the companies participating in the scheme.  Pension increases are at the discretion of the trustees.  </P>
        <P>During 2008, the DAA reached agreement with the trade unions representing the majority of staff to establish, subject to the approval of the Ministers for Transport and Finance, certain additional pension arrangements independent of the existing scheme.  The two Ministers gave approval in principle to the proposed new pension arrangements in 2009.  These proposals would involve an additional DAA scheme to provide enhanced benefits for existing and retired members of the IASS and the establishment of a new hybrid (part defined benefit/part defined contribution) scheme for new recruits.</P><Col N="746"/>
        <P>I am aware of major issues with regard to the asset values of this fund.  These are highlighted in the DAA&rsquo;s annual report for 2009.  Funding matters, in the first instance, are matters for the Trustees of the Scheme who are preparing funding proposals as required under Pension legislation.</P>

	<P>My Department provides centralised support for 24 websites developed under its IT Shared Service model.  Figures recorded in 2009 indicate that there were over one quarter of a million unique visits to my Department&rsquo;s main site (www.justice.ie) and over a half a million unique visits to the website of the Irish Naturalisation &amp; Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).  Individual visits are not recorded for all sites.</P>
        <P>Hosting and related charges for these sites in 2009 came to &euro;38,408.  Other costs, such as staff time spent maintaining the site content which forms part of the day to day work of the Department, are not separately accounted for.  Websites are an essential communications tool for any modern organisation in providing essential customer services.  As part of the Shared Service model, websites are developed and maintained based on reusable templates.  This approach has led to a reduction in the cost and effort of setting up and supporting  websites.</P>

	<P>The majority of females who entered or were placed in Magdalen Laundries in the period did so without any direct involvement of the State.  Magdalen laundries were not State institutions and their records are a matter for the individual religious congregations concerned.</P>
        <P>A small proportion of entrants to Magdalen Laundries came through the criminal justice system. While my Department, therefore, does not hold records that would show the total number of women who were sent to Magdalen Laundries, there are  court records dealing with those cases involving female offenders where it was a condition that the offender reside in a particular institution including Magdalen laundries for a specified period.  These records are not maintained in a manner that allows records relating to Magdalen laundries to be easily extracted.  There are also incomplete records relating to the remand of 16-21 year old females charged with criminal offences to St Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s Asylum, Sean McDermott Street in the period 1960 to 1980 pending trial.</P><Col N="747"/>
        <P>As regards records that might be held by other Departments or agencies, the Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, myself and other Ministers met with various groups representing survivors of residential institutions for children on the 15th April last.  The position of the women who had spent time in Magdalen Laundries was raised by representatives of some victims&rsquo; groups. At that meeting the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, stated that Government Departments and Agencies would be willing to help with further enquiries in relation to those persons sent to Magdalen Laundries, including, where available, access to files etc., to the greatest extent possible.</P>

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.

All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 30 June 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations <Col N="749"/>to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of these representations, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, it was decided to not issue a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned. Instead, the person concerned was granted Leave to Remain in the State for a three year period to 24 March 2012.  This decision was conveyed in writing to the person concerned by letter dated 23 March 2009.</P>
        <P>On 29 May 2009 the legal representative of the person concerned advised my Department that they had, on their client&rsquo;s behalf, lodged an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  In response, my Department advised that legal representative that as their client had been granted permission to remain in the State, he was not entitled to apply for Subsidiary Protection.  However, as an exceptional measure, my Department agreed to consider an application under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 i.e. a formal request to the Minister that he exercise his discretion to facilitate the consideration of an application for Subsidiary Protection.</P>
        <P>The Regulation 4(2) request was approved, and the person concerned was considered for Subsidiary Protection. Following consideration of this application, it was determined that the person concerned was not eligible for Subsidiary Protection. The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 25 January 2010. The Deputy might wish to note that this negative decision has no impact on the existing status of the person concerned i.e. he still has permission to remain in the State, subject to stated conditions, until 24 March 2012.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), that it is the policy of my Department not to extend a permission to remain to persons who are admitted for a period of 90 days or less on a short stay visit, save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances.  The reason for that policy is that an extension of visitor&rsquo;s permission should not generally arise in circumstances where the person has accurately and fully disclosed their purpose for intending to come to the State at the visa application stage and/or to the immigration officer at the port of entry.   Where exceptional and unforeseen circumstances arise, the person may contact my Department to seek to extend their permission to remain.</P>
        <P>Where the person seeking a change of status is of a nationality that is not visa required, some additional latitude may be applied on a case by case basis where that person&rsquo;s circumstances have changed since their arrival in the State.

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in August 2007.  All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

	<P>It is noted that the address of the person concerned as supplied by the Deputy does not match the address currently on record for the person concerned.  As it is incumbent on an applicant to notify my Department when they change address it would be in the best interest of the person concerned to inform my Department of his correct address without delay.</P>
        <P>The person concerned is the subject of a  Deportation Order following a comprehensive and thorough examination of his asylum claim and of his application to remain temporarily in the State. He has been evading his deportation since September 2009 and should he come to the notice of the Garda&iacute;, he would be liable to arrest and detention. He should, therefore, present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau without any further delay.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the first named person in question was granted permission to remain in the State under the IBC/05 scheme in 2005. This permission was renewed in 2007 and is currently <Col N="752"/>valid up to 7 December 2010. The first named person concerned should present to her local immigration officer 2 weeks before that date for registration of her future permission to remain in the State.  The second named person arrived in the State in 1997 in the company of his mother and siblings and was included as a child dependant in his mother&rsquo;s unsuccessful asylum application.  The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform signed a Deportation Order in respect of him on 6 June 2002, which was later revoked.</P>
        <P>The second named person was, by letter dated 31 March 2009, advised that as he had no legal basis to remain in the State, the Minister was proposing to make a Deportation Order in respect of him and advised him of the options open to him at that point in time which were to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to deportation or to submit, within a period of 15 working days, written representations setting out reasons as to why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. Representations have been received from the second named person.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the second named person will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made,  this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 12 September 2006.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration <Col N="757"/>of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 14 February 2008, and amended letter dated 4 April 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might wish to note that there is no record in my Department of an application in respect of the brother of the person concerned, either for residency or under family reunification. The Deputy might also wish to note that the current position in the State of the person concerned is not such as would enable him to make an application for family reunification for his brother, or indeed any other member of his family. Access to family reunification is confined to persons recognised as refugees or with subsidiary protection status.</P>

Instead, he was granted Leave to Remain in the State for the  period to 20 March 2010.  This decision was conveyed in writing to the person concerned by letter dated 21 October 2009.  The person concerned is required to apply in writing for the renewal of this permission. As my Department&rsquo;s records show no evidence of such a renewal application having been made to date, it is recommended that the person concerned should do so without further delay.</P>

	<P>As I indicated on 20 May last I have identified the necessity to examine further contingency arrangements for passport production.  This could include the provision of passport production equipment in the North West and the South of the country.  I have asked my officials to examine the feasibility of providing this service. However, as the examination is at a very early stage it is premature to confirm if or when a passport office might be opened in the North West.  As of now and into the future, passport applications can be submitted through the Passport Express Service available at Post Offices across the North West and throughout the country. </P>

	<P>The establishment of the North/South Consultative Forum, provided for in both the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement, has been discussed with the Northern Ireland Executive at all the plenary meetings of the North/South Ministerial Council since the re-establishment of the Executive in May 2007.  At those meetings, the Government delegation is led by the Taoiseach, while the Northern Ireland Executive delegation is led by the First Minister and deputy First Minister.  The plenary meeting in July 2007 noted the intention of the Northern Ireland Executive first to complete its review of the Northern Ireland Civic Forum, a body provided for in the Good Friday Agreement for consulting civic society in Northern Ireland.  That review is still outstanding. </P>
        <P Just="Left">During 2008, the Government consulted with the social partners and various cross-Border and North/South groups on the establishment of the Consultative Forum.  Following on from this we formally communicated our proposals to the Northern Ireland Executive on the role, format, membership and operation of the Forum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 15 October 2009, as a contribution to the process leading to the establishment of the Forum, the Government facilitated a consultative conference in Farmleigh involving the social partners and other civil society groups from across the island.  The conference was opened by the Taoiseach.  Participants from across the island came from all traditions, including representatives from business, the trade union movement, agriculture and the community and voluntary sector.  There was a wide ranging discussion on the role of civil society and its capacity to contribute meaningfully to cross-Border co-operation.  There was strong support for further such engagement to explore specific areas for co-operation, North and South, at the level of civil society.</P>
        <P>Following on from the October event, and to contribute further to the process leading to the establishment of the Consultative Forum, a second consultative conference took place in Dublin, yesterday, 26 May. As on the occasion in October last, the event was well attended, with over one hundred representatives from civil society from both parts of the island in attendance.  There were two panel discussions on the key themes of the conference; sport and young people, and the role that innovation can play in economic recovery, North and South. There was further strong endorsement for continuing engagement between representatives of civil society, North and South.  The establishment of the formal North South Consultative Forum will be further discussed at the next plenary meeting of the NSMC, scheduled for 5 July 2010. We will press strongly to have the matter brought to an early conclusion.</P>

	<P>The situation to which the Deputy refers concerns the attack on a humanitarian convoy in San Juan Copola, Oaxaca, on 27 April, in which a Mexican human rights defender, Ms Beatriz Carino and a Finnish observer, Mr Tyri Antero Jaakkola were killed by paramilitaries. Several other Human Rights Defenders and journalists suffered injuries.  Ms Carino was a speaker at the Frontline 5th Dublin Platform <Col N="764"/>Conference for Human Rights Defenders in February of this year.  I wish to take this opportunity to extend my sympathies to her family and that of Mr Jaakkola. </P>
        <P>I welcome the statement made on 3 May by the Spanish Presidency of the EU on behalf of EU Member States, which condemned the attack and called on the relevant authorities to do everything possible to identify, arrest and convict those responsible for the attack as well as taking all necessary measures to protect Human Rights Defenders in Mexico.  I note also the statement on 12 May by four UN Special Rapporteurs on this case (the Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights Defenders; the Special Rapporteur on Summary, Extrajudicial or Arbitrary Executions; the Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous People and the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights to Freedom of Opinion and Expression).  I share their concern that the situation in some parts of Mexico is extremely complex and that the difficulties faced by the Mexican Government, including in the context of its fight against drugs cartels, are very serious.  While Mexico has taken significant steps in promoting respect for human rights, considerable challenges remain to be addressed, in particular at state level.  There is no justification for failing to take strong steps when Human Rights Defenders are killed.  To that end, I welcome the investigation set up by the Mexican authorities into the incident at San Juan Copala.</P>
        <P>I have asked our Ambassador to Mexico to inform the Mexican authorities of the interest with which the Government, members of the Oireachtas and the NGO community are following this case, given Ms Carino&rsquo;s connection to Ireland and her participation in the recent Frontline Conference.  Ireland, together with our European Union partners, monitors and engages with the Mexican authorities on the human rights situation in Mexico and the fulfilment of Mexico&rsquo;s human rights obligations under international law. As part of this process, the first meeting of a recently established EU-Mexico Human Rights Dialogue took place in Mexico City on 12 May. With our EU partners, we will continue to engage in dialogue with the Mexican authorities at both federal and state level.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been following developments closely in this case since the Irish citizen was abducted from France to Hungary in contravention of a custody order of a French Court.  My officials, both in Dublin and in the Embassy in Budapest have been in regular contact with the father of the Irish citizen concerning this case.  Diplomatic staff in our Embassy in Budapest, have met with the relevant authorities in Hungary on numerous occasions to raise our concerns. </P>
        <P>Following the abduction of the child from France to Hungary, the father initiated legal proceedings in Hungary, in early 2008, under The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction to have the child returned to France her country of habitual residence.</P>
        <P>Following the completion of legal proceedings in Hungary in July 2009, a bailiff was granted powers including police assistance to enforce an Order of the Hungarian High Court compelling the mother to hand over the child to her father. On 29 July 2009, when the bailiff went to a house in the village of Boconad in order to enforce the Order, he found that the mother had absconded with the child.  Diplomatic staff from our Embassy and from the Embassy of France in Budapest were present in Boconad on that occasion to observe proceedings and provide consular assistance.  The Hungarian authorities subsequently issued a search warrant in respect of the mother but to date neither she nor the child have been found.  On the evening of 28 October 2009, a diplomatic officer from the Embassy travelled at short notice to the town of Eger following a tip off to the child&rsquo;s father that his ex-wife and daughter had been living there.  The bailiff and officials from the French Embassy were also present.  The bailiff carried out a search but despite the information passed to the father, the child could not be located at the address indicated</P>
        <P>I wrote to the Hungarian Foreign Minister on 29 September 2009 and urged that the Hungarian authorities take all appropriate action to locate the child with a view to enforcing the Court Order.  The Hungarian Foreign Minister has requested the Minister of Justice and Law Enforcement, who is responsible in Hungary for child abduction cases, to ensure that this case is handled with proper care and maximum attention.  In February, officials from my Department raised the case with Hungarian State Secretary Czukor when he visited Dublin. The State Secretary gave an assurance that every effort would be made to find the missing child and that the Hungarian authorities were very concerned about the child&rsquo;s welfare.</P>
        <P>I have also been in contact with my French counterpart Mr. Bernard Kouchner concerning this case.  Our Embassy in Paris has been in touch with the Office for International Co-operation in Civil and Commercial Matters, in the Ministry of Justice of France.  Last week a diplomat from the Irish Embassy in Paris met with officials from that Office to discuss this case and to seek their continued assistance in ensuring the return of the child.  The French officials confirmed that they had been in touch with the Hungarian counterparts on numerous occasions in relation to this case.  We have also recently requested Minister Ahern to raise this case with his Hungarian counterpart the next occasion he has an opportunity to meet him.</P>
        <P>In relation to the father&rsquo;s case before the European Court of Human Rights, there is no facility to submit written comments unless invited to do so by the Court.  The Government has not received any invitation from the Court to submit written comments concerning this case. In the event of receipt of any invitation, consideration will be given to submitting written comments.  Any possible proceedings before the European Court of Justice in relation to this matter would be a matter for the Department for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the final analysis, it is for the Hungarian authorities to enforce the custody judgment of the French Court under the Hague Convention.  We will continue to urge them to pursue the case vigorously but we are not in a position ourselves to execute the court order.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 172 and 177 to 179, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Firstly, I wish to refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 98 of 6 Bealtaine 2010, in which I indicated that the recognition of Irish as an official working language of the European Union with effect from 1 January 2007 presented the EU Institutions with a significant recruitment challenge.  The Government took a number of steps to assist the EU Institutions in meeting this challenge and to ensure the availability of sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to support the new status of Irish at the EU.  These steps included the establishment in 2006 of a dedicated fund &mdash; the Advanced Irish Languages Skills Initiative &mdash; to provide funding for specialised Irish language third-level courses and support for translation of EU terminology into Irish.</P>
        <P>The Advanced Skills Initiative was put in place in order to increase the number of professionals with the necessary skills in the context of the requirements arising from the new status of Irish at the EU and also from the ongoing implementation at home of the Official Languages Act 2003.  The fund is administered by my Department in conjunction with the Higher Education Authority.  By the end of 2009, a total of eight full-time courses and two intensive short-term courses provided by various institutions were in operation.</P>
        <P>The table below sets out the level of funding provided by my Department for each year since 2006 on these educational initiatives and in support of translation of EU terminology into Irish.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In relation to the stipends and accommodation expenses paid to students who participated in the 16 week intensive course for qualified lawyers referred to by the Deputy, no means test applied, but applications were assessed by the institutions concerned.  As the Deputy will be aware, there was an urgent need to ensure that lawyer-linguists proficient in Irish became available as speedily as possible.  It was in this context that it was agreed that each participant on the course would be paid a stipend, as well as accommodation expenses in the case of participants based outside Dublin.  The payment of a stipend was intended to help compensate participants who would be unable to work while attending this full-time course.  I wish also to again reiterate that the relevant institution provided my Department with detailed information in relation to the participants who qualified for accommodation costs, prior to funding being made available in this regard.</P>
        <P>Finally, I am advised that the number of persons recruited by the EU institutions to meet requirements arising in relation to Irish being an official and working language of the EU is <Col N="768"/>43.  In addition, there are 25 accredited freelance interpreters.  A breakdown of these figures between the various EU Institutions is set out below:</P>

The funding allocated will support nearly 500 initiatives that the Task Forces have prioritised for investment in their respective areas.  In addition, I recently announced that funding of &euro;600,000 is being made available for small-scale capital projects in the Task Force areas.  Proposals in this regard are currently being developed by the Task Forces.  I am satisfied that, with the funding allocated from my Department, the Task Forces will continue to make a positive impact on the drugs problem in their areas through their community-based initiatives. </P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the actions he is taking to ensure that the proposal by the European Commission that the EU should set a target of reducing poverty by 25% by 2020 is accepted. </Quest>
        <QRef>[21608/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the European Council at its meeting in March 2010 agreed on the inclusion of five headline targets in <i>Europe 2020: A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth</i>.  The targets constitute shared objectives guiding the action of the Member States and the Union on the key areas where action is needed: knowledge and innovation, a more sustainable economy, high employment and social inclusion. </P>
        <P>The target to promote social inclusion is framed in terms of poverty reduction.  Its purpose is to measure progress in reducing poverty and in ensuring that the benefits of growth and jobs <Col N="771"/>are shared.  The Commission proposed a target of reducing poverty in Europe by 25 per cent, or 20 million people, using the at-risk-of-poverty indicator. The European Council decided that further work is needed on appropriate indicators and will revert to the issue at its June 2010 meeting. The Irish Government supports the decision to include a poverty target in the European strategy for 2020. Ireland favours the formulation of a poverty target based on indicators which appropriately reflect the multi-dimensional nature of poverty and exclusion.</P>
        <P>The EU Social Protection Committee (SPC) is advising on the appropriate indicators for an EU poverty target. Officials of my own Department and of other relevant Departments are actively participating in these deliberations.  The advice of the SPC will be presented for consideration at the ESPHCA Council of Ministers meeting on 7/8 June. It is anticipated that the poverty target will be decided at the European Council meeting later in June.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the overall EU poverty reduction target will be translated into national targets on the basis of appropriate indicators given national circumstances and priorities.  Since 1997, the Government has adopted poverty targets as part of its national policy against poverty and for social inclusion.  The Irish target is based on a composite poverty indicator known as &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo;.  The indicator identifies the percentage of the population which is both below 60 per cent of median income (known as &lsquo;at-risk-of-poverty&rsquo;) and experiencing material deprivation (the enforced lack of two or more basic necessities).</P>
        <P>The Government target in the <i>National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016</i> is to further reduce consistent poverty to between 2-4 per cent by 2012 and to eliminate it by 2016.  The latest results (2008) from the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) (released November 2009) indicate that poverty trends are on track to achieve both the 2012 and 2016 targets.  The rate of consistent poverty in the population in 2008 was 4.2 per cent, down from 5.1 per cent in 2007 and 6.5 per cent in 2006.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is responsible for a number of grant schemes that may be relevant to the issue he has raised:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Under the EU co-funded Rural Development Programme Ireland 2007 &mdash; 2013, funding is available for the provision of basic services &mdash; including the development of amenity and leisure facilities &mdash; for rural communities.  Details of the 36 groups administering the Programme are available from my Department&rsquo;s website www.pobail.ie.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Under the Exchequer-funded Gaeltacht Improvement Schemes, funding is made available to provide or improve local recreational facilities (sports fields, changing rooms, handball alleys, community halls, summer colleges, family support centres, etc) in the Gaeltacht.  Application forms are available directly from my Department&rsquo;s offices in Na Forbacha in Galway. </P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Deputy may also wish to note that the Programme of Grants for Locally-based Community and Voluntary Organisations, which was part-funded from the National Lottery, provided funding in respect of the refurbishment of community premises and the purchase of equipment for <Col N="772"/>community and voluntary organisations.  The Programme is, however, suspended at present and I do not envisage it re-opening for new applications in the foreseeable future.</P>

	<P>The current budgetary position necessitated the changes made to social welfare benefits, including treatment benefits, in Budget 2010.  From 1st January 2010, treatments available under the optical and dental elements of the scheme are limited to the free examination.  There has been no change to the medical appliances element of the scheme.  Over 2 million PRSI contributors are eligible for the free dental and optical examination and medical appliance benefit in 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2009 over 418,000 customers claimed a free dental examination at a cost of over &euro;14 million.  In addition 219,000 free eye examinations, at a cost of almost &euro;5.5 million were also provided.  There were also 7,500 treatments under the medical appliance scheme, at a cost of over &euro;7.5 million.  Similar levels of applications can be expected this year.  The continued provision of a free examination will allow people to have regular check-ups and help ensure the early detection of disease and other health issues.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a number of defined benefit pension plans have cut the accrued benefits payable to their members, and the Pensions Board expects the number of such plans to increase significantly during 2010; the action he is taking to address this problem. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>There are almost 1,200 defined benefit pension schemes subject to the Funding Standard.  In the last 12 months, the Pensions Board has processed 5 applications from schemes, under Section 50 of the Pensions Act, to reduce benefits.  Four of these were approved and one rejected.  Another application is pending.  The Pensions Board acknowledges that, given recent economic difficulties, further applications may be made under Section 50 of the Pensions Act.</P>
        <P>Due to the economic downturn, approximately 90% of defined benefit pension schemes were underfunded at the end of 2008.  The vast majority of these schemes opted to work with the Pensions Board to devise a funding proposal aimed at recovering their financial position, rather than opt for cutting promised benefits by restructuring their pension schemes.</P>
        <P>Overall returns for pension schemes in 2009 averaged at more than 20% and went some way to assisting schemes in their attempts to recover their funding positions.  Reflecting this, a survey by the Pensions Board at the end of 2009 suggested that the number of underfunded schemes had reduced to 75%.  Although this is an encouraging indicator, it is crucial that we continue to assist schemes in their recovery.  This is why the Pensions Regulator recently announced an extension of the deadline for submission of funding proposals for those due to submit before 30 June next by 5 months, to 30 November 2010.</P>

	<P>Child Benefit was paid to the person concerned in respect of one child for the period June 2006 to September 2008.

	<P>In order to be able to vote at elections and referenda in this jurisdiction, a person&rsquo;s name must be entered in the register of electors for a constituency in the State in which the person ordinarily resides.</P>
        <P>Postal voting is provided for in electoral law in respect of certain categories of person who are entered in the register of electors. The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by whole-time members of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses. Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996); electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day and full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State &mdash; in these cases, the law provides for completion of the necessary voting documentation at a Garda station (the Electoral Act 1997); certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001); and electors who  because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006).</P><Col N="777"/>

        <Quest> if he will refer to the new regulations brought in last October 2009 regarding fire regularisation certificates; if he will provide a progress report on same; if any certificates have been issued since October 2009; the local authorities that have issued same; if agreement has been reached with Dublin City Council on the operation of the system; the status of process involved in an application; if it is the equivalent of a planning application, must one get a decision by a due date; if approval is granted if no formal response is received; and if approval has now been granted for an application (details supplied) in Dublin 11. </Quest>

	<P>The implementation of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2009 which provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for a Regularisation Certificate, is the responsibility of the 37 local Building Control Authorities. While information is not currently available on the number of Regularisation Certificates issued since the operative date of 1 October 2009,  authorities will be requested to include this  information in all building control statistical returns forwarded to my Department for the period  January &mdash; June 2010 and thereafter.  My Department is currently in consultation with the Consultative Committee of the National Directorate on Emergency Planning and Management to assist Building Control Authorities in practical implementation of certain aspects of the Regulations, including Regularisation Certificates.</P>
        <P>There is a statutory period of two months, or such extended period as may be agreed between the applicant and the Building Control Authority, within which the Authority is required to make a decision on an application for a Regularisation Certificate, beginning on the date of application for the Certificate. A Certificate may be granted, with or without conditions, or refused by the Building Control Authority.  The making of a decision on the application referred to in the Question is a matter for Dublin City Council. My Department understands from the Council that the application is in the final stages of consideration and the Council expects to make a decision on it very shortly.</P>

	<P>My Department issued preliminary approval for the project in <Col N="782"/>question to proceed to planning stage in June 2009, subject to a number of design and costing clarifications to be submitted by Dublin City Council.  My Department has since been in regular contact with the Council in relation to the project. The Council has addressed remaining design concerns and documentation has recently been submitted to my Department.  This is currently being assessed with a view to progressing the project to Part VIII planning stage as soon as possible, in the context of Dublin City Council&rsquo;s overall Social Housing Investment Programme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 and 208 together.</P>
        <P>The Government has demonstrated a clear commitment to dealing effectively with the range of complex issues relating to multi-unit developments and is bringing forward a comprehensive suite of legislative proposals in response to the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s Report on Multi-unit Developments.  In its consultation paper issued in late 2006 the Law Reform Commission made a number of recommendations relating to areas within the remit of my Department. Those recommendations relating to planning and to physical aspects of multi-unit developments were addressed in 2007-08 through the Planning Guidelines issued by my Department addressing design standards, sustainable residential development and the taking in charge of residential developments/management arrangements.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s Report also recommended that legislation be introduced to address a range of other key issues, relating to management companies, common areas, service charges, sinking funds and dispute resolution. These recommendations were then considered by an interdepartmental group which included representatives from my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform the Department of the Taoiseach and the National Consumer Agency. The deliberations of this group led to the preparation of the Multi-unit Developments Bill 2009 by the Department of Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform. Matters relating to this Bill, including the timing of enactment, are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

	<P>I refer to the replies to Questions Nos. 798 of 20 April 2010 and 128 of 6 May 2010.  On 18 October 2005, Kildare County Council submitted a proposal, plan and cost estimate for the Ballyna Group Water Scheme. The proposed cost of the scheme was &euro;11.3 million.  The proposal was that the Ballyna Group Water Scheme would connect to the Johnstownbridge Wellfield Development at the outlet from the proposed Carbury Hill reservoir.  The scheme, renamed the Ballyna Regional Water Supply Scheme, was subsequently included in the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 as a scheme to advance through planning.</P>
        <P>While provision is made to commence contracts to the value of some &euro;160 million in the county during the period of the programme, it was not possible to include the Ballyna Regional Water Supply Scheme or the Kildare Water Supply Scheme Phase 1 Wellfield Contract (Johnstownbridge/Robertstown) amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion.  The reply to Question No. 128 of 6 May 2010 sets out the criteria for the development of the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 to 217, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure over the next three years. This Programme is presented on a river basin district basis and lists the contracts to commence construction or advance through planning in respect of the water services authorities in the relevant district over the period 2010 to 2012.  In addition details of the contracts and schemes in the Programme, on a county basis, are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Allocations under the Rural Water Programme are made on an annual basis, and County Councils were notified of their block grant allocations under the 2010 Rural Water Programme last month. A list showing the overall allocations to each Council is available in the Oireachtas Library.  These block grant allocations cover both funding for group water and sewerage schemes and small public water and sewerage schemes.  The major part of the funding for the group sector is directed at investment required under the Rural Water Action Plan developed in response to an adverse ruling against Ireland by the European Court of Justice.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the administration of the Rural Water Programme has been devolved to water services authorities since 1997. The selection and approval of individual group water and sewerage schemes for advancement and funding under the programme, within the overall priorities set by my Department and subject to the block grant allocation provided, is therefore a matter for the water services authorities.  Allocations under the programme for 2011 and 2012 will be decided on the basis of the relevant submissions to be made by water services authorities at the time and taking into consideration the funding that will then be available.</P>

	<P>In accordance with section 130 of the Broadcasting Act, 2009 RT&Eacute; is required to take steps to promote the availability of Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) receiver equipment.  In relation to such equipment (receivers, televisions and set top boxes), RT&Eacute; has contracted Teracom to test receivers against the Irish DTT specification.  A manufacturer must submit their products to Teracom for testing and once the product has passed the tests they can apply to RT&Eacute; to use the RT&Eacute; SAORVIEW logo.  This logo will indicate compatibility with the Irish DTT specification.</P>
        <P>This testing and certification process is an operational and contractual matter for RT&Eacute;.  That said, I have been informed by RT&Eacute;, however, that Teracom have received enquiries from a number of parties expressing interest in submitting receivers for test.  To date, one manufacturer has submitted a receiver and this is currently being tested.  I understand that RT&Eacute; is aware of a number of other manufacturers that have expressed interest.  RT&Eacute; only issues the Saorview logo on completion of this technical certification process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Prior to the commencement of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to help determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, were to be excluded.</P>
        <P>EU State aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  That mapping exercise found a number of broadband suppliers were already active in the area referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question and consequently the locality was excluded from the Scheme.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at www.callcosts.ie</P>
        <P>It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight <Col N="787"/>etc.).  The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently considering the design and implementation of a scheme which would use this funding to address the issue of basic broadband availability to un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  As the scheme is only at the design stage, there is no application process at this juncture.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</P>

	<P>A number of REPS 4 plans produced using eREPS included chemical phosphorus levels which appeared to be in excess of the levels permitted. This situation was not caused by any deficiency in the eREPS system but because instructions for using the system were not followed.  To try to prevent this happening again, work was carried out in February 2010 on the eREPS system to provide additional navigational aids to planners. In addition, a revised checking procedure was introduced in March 2010 for use on all adjusted plans involving chemical phosphorus.</P>

	<P>Greencastle harbour is owned by Donegal County Council and the maintenance and development of the harbour is the responsibility of the Council in the first instance.  My Department has, however, in recent years, project managed works on phase 1 of the Greencastle Harbour development project on behalf of Donegal County Council as well as providing funding.  The position with regard to <Col N="789"/>providing further funding for the Greencastle project is that I have provided adequate funding in the capital programme for 2010 to suspend the project in a safe and acceptable manner.  My Department is however engaged in ongoing discussions with Donegal County Council in relation to financial issues and will keep the matter under review on an ongoing basis having regard to overall expenditure in the Fishery Harbours and Coastal Infrastructure Capital Programme.  It is, of course, open to Donegal County Council as owners of the harbour at Greencastle to continue works on the breakwater out of their own resources.</P>

	<P>REPS 3 participants were paid for a twelve months period in advance at each anniversary of the start of their contract. Almost all of the final-year payments to participants in REPS 3, the last version of the scheme to which this payment arrangement applies, have now issued. </P>
        <P>Participants in REPS 4 are paid in respect of each calendar year rather than for each twelve-month contract period.  EU Regulations allow for payment of  75% once administrative checks on all participants  have been completed and payment of the remaining 25% when all on-the-spot inspections for the year have been carried out. The administrative checks are comprehensive in nature and are in place to satisfy EU audit requirements.  In a significant number of the applications received under the scheme, the administrative checks raised issues and queries which required further detailed examination. This led to delays in payment in 2009.  Industrial relations issues in some of my Department&rsquo;s local offices also contributed to the delays.</P>
        <P>A total of 29,376 applications were received for participation in REPS 4 for payment in 2009.  So far, 24,023 applicants have received full payment for 2009 and work is continuing to process the remainder as quickly as possible.  It is not possible to give an average length of the time it took for a REPS Scheme payment to issue in respect of 2009 as there were a number of different factors, and varying timescales, affecting the processing of each individual case.</P>
        <P>I anticipate that REPS payments in 2010 will not be subject to the delays encountered in 2009.  Inevitably, administrative checks for joining the REPS 4 Scheme are more exhaustive and detailed than subsequent administrative checks required to process ongoing applications for payment throughout the contract period. In this context, the application for payment for REPS 4 is the Single Farm Payment Form which is due by 15 May each year.  In view of this, I am confident that the first payments for REPS 4 this year will begin to issue in early Autumn.</P>

        <P>The Labour Market Activation Fund, 2010 is intended to support the provision of training and education programmes for the unemployed &mdash; prioritising the low skilled, and those formerly employed in declining sectors such as construction, retail and manufacturing sectors, with particular emphasis on the under 35&rsquo;s and the long-term unemployed.  Intending participants on programmes eligible for Fund support must be in receipt of an unemployment payment for a period of at least three consecutive months, or equivalent thereof, before joining the programmes (time spent on training or education programmes will be reckonable for this three-month period). Individual third-level education providers may specify additional entry requirements for courses being offered, depending on the nature of the subjects and level of qualification on graduation, to ensure that applicants are equal to the demands of, and can successfully finish the courses.</P>
        <P>A Call for Proposals was issued in March for the provision of training and education programmes for the unemployed to be supported by the Fund. Some 370 tenders were received by the deadline of Thursday 8th April. It is intended that the process of awarding contracts to successful providers will begin shortly, following which successful programme providers will be actively seeking to enrol participants to their programmes.</P>

	<P>The policies and criteria for the inclusion in, or alignment with, the Framework of awards made by universities and other awarding bodies are the responsibility of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI). For an award to be recognised through the Framework at a particular level, the specific learning outcomes associated with that award must be demonstrated to be in line with the learning outcomes associated with that level of the Framework.  The NQAI maintains on its website a list of awards which have been recognised through the Framework and the course provided by UCC which is referred to in the question is included in that list as a Level 7 Special Purpose Award.</P>
        <P>Universities, as autonomous academically independent institutions within the meaning of the Universities Act 1997, are themselves responsible for establishing and implementing procedures for access, transfer and progression (ATP). Under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999 the NQAI has a role in facilitating and advising universities on the implementation of such procedures.  Therefore, where a person applies to a university for access to a particular course, it is for the university itself to apply its own procedures regarding ATP.  It should be noted that the Framework level to which an award is assigned is only one of the issues to be considered. Other issues such as the size of the award and the course content are also of relevance.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> the guidelines that exist for qualification recognition for qualifications obtained overseas; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two main modes of recognition for qualifications obtained overseas: the recognition of academic qualifications and the recognition of professional qualifications in regulated professions.  In 2004 Ireland became a signatory to the 1997 Lisbon Convention on the recognition of qualifications in higher education in the European Region. The Convention requires that qualifications issued by other parties to the Convention for access to higher education be recognised in the host State unless a substantial difference can be shown in the requirements of the host State vis a vis those in the home State. The Convention requires that transparent mechanisms be established for the assessment and recognition of higher education qualifications.  </P>
        <P>Under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999 the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI) has statutory responsibility for facilitating the recognition in the State of academic awards made by bodies outside the State. In 2003 the NQAI assumed the role of the Irish ENIC-NARIC (European Network of Information Centres- National Academic Recognition Information Centre) and since then has established a qualifications recognition service (found at the website www.qualificationsrecognition.ie) which is aimed at individuals, employers, education providers and other stakeholders who may have enquiries concerning education and training awards made outside of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The recognition service website includes an International Qualifications Database which contains information regarding foreign qualifications which have been processed to date by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and states the advice that has been issued regarding the comparability of the qualifications in Ireland. The recognition service receives a large number of  formal applications for recognition information annually, peaking at over 2,000 in 2008, and the website was visited over 55,000 times during 2009.  Professional qualifications are those qualifications which a person is required to hold in order to access a particular profession e.g. medicine. The qualifications which are required are set down by a competent authority <Col N="794"/>and that body is then responsible for assessing a person&rsquo;s qualifications to ascertain whether that person should be granted access to that profession.</P>
        <P>The main mechanism by which professional qualifications are recognised in Ireland is set down in EU Directive 2005/36 on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications. The purpose of the Directive, which came into force in October 2007, is to help make labour markets more flexible, further liberalise the provision of services, encourage more automatic recognition of qualifications, and simplify administrative procedures.  Under the Directive, provisions are made whereby Professionals qualified in one (home) Member State can seek professional recognition of their qualifications in another (host) Member State for the purpose of practising their profession in that host Member State.  My Department is co-ordinating authority for the implementation of the Directive and information regarding the Directive is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a process by which learning that has already taken place prior to enrolment on a programme of study is given a value. This learning process may have taken place formally through a further or higher education provider or informally or non-formally through work/life experiences. The broad aim of RPL is to enable and encourage people to enter or re-enter formal education, leading to qualifications, by awarding or recognising credit for what is already known of the course curriculum. </P>
        <P>The National Framework of Qualifications incorporates a wide range of awards recognising learning wherever it is gained. The Framework is an important tool in recognising prior learning as it is based on learning outcomes. The recognition of prior learning can be facilitated by referencing the learning outcomes included at each level of the Framework.  In 2005, after consultation with relevant stakeholders, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI) set out principles and operational guidelines for a national approach to RPL. These were developed as a first step in coordinating the work of awarding bodies and providers of RPL. They address quality, assessment, documentation, communication and guidance. The principles are intended to encourage the development and expansion of processes for RPL by education and training providers and awarding bodies.</P>
        <P>Under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999 it is a requirement that providers who have programmes validated by either HETAC or FETAC or which have been delegated authority to make awards and the Dublin Institute of Technology implement the NQAI&rsquo;s procedures on access, transfer and progression, including policy on RPL.  Universities, as autonomous awarding bodies, are each responsible for RPL in their respective institutions. The NQAI, in drafting the principles and guidelines referred to above, requested that universities would have regard to them in developing their own RPL procedures.  Ireland was one of 20 countries to take place in an OECD study on the Recognition of Non-Formal and Informal Learning and 2008. The findings of this study form the basis of ongoing actions to strengthen arrangements in this area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241 and 242 together.</P>
        <P>Forward Planning Section of my Department is analysing demographic trends and the impact for school infrastructure provision on an ongoing basis. Based on this analysis of current demographic trends it is anticipated that there will be a need for a further post-primary school in the Clonburris, Lucan area in the medium term. More detailed analysis will be required in order to determine an optimum date for the commencement of that school.</P>
        <P>In the interim, my Department has increased post-primary school capacity in the Lucan area with the provision of recently completed building projects. This includes the opening of a new post-primary school in Adamstown in September 2009 which has capacity to cater for up to 1,000 pupils. These recently completed projects, in addition to currently planned extension projects, will assist in reducing pressure for pupil places in the short to medium term while the process of advancing the project for a new school continues.</P>
        <P>I have previously stated that given the changing nature of Irish society and the projected need for a number of post-primary schools to open in the medium term, the Department is considering a number of broad policy issues regarding the establishment of new post-primary schools. As part of this, consideration is being given to the setting up of a new framework in relation to the establishment of new second-level schools and their patronage. New schools where only very initial planning has taken place, such as the case of the proposed new school in Lucan referred to by the Deputy, will be considered in the context of this framework when it is established.  It is my intention to finalise this matter and convey a decision to all relevant parties at the earliest date possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 7,453 apprentices are currently registered by F&Aacute;S as redundant.  The following measures have been initiated to support redundant apprentices:  </P>
        <P el="5">1. F&Aacute;S has put in place an interim measure whereby redundant apprentices may progress to the next off-the-job training phase of their apprenticeship, in line with current scheduling criteria.  In 2009, over 2,000 redundant apprentices were provided with off-the-job training.  To date in 2010, 2,523 redundant apprentices commenced off-the-job training and of these 1,251 have completed phase 4 and phase 6 off-the-job training in the Institutes of Technology and Colleges of Further Education.</P><Col N="797"/>
        <P el="5">2. F&Aacute;S in 2009 introduced a temporary Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme for apprentices made redundant in the Construction Industry whereby the vacancy arising from the release of the employed apprentice to a scheduled phase 4 and phase 6 off-the-job training phase was filled by a redundant apprentice who thereby gained on-the-job training.  Over 460 redundant apprentices completed Phase 3, 5 and 7 on-the-job training and assessments with employers under this Scheme in 2009.  The Redundant Apprentices Placement Scheme replaced the Rotation Scheme for 2010 and was launched in April 2010 by F&Aacute;S.  The scheme with an allocation for 2010 of almost &euro;4m will provide up to 750 apprentices with the opportunity to complete their on-the-job training at Phases 3 and 5 with the support of employers with a proven past record of providing consistent systematic training.</P>
        <P el="5">3. A joint ESB Networks-F&Aacute;S programme commenced in March 2009 where on-the-job training with ESB Networks is provided to eligible redundant apprentices at Phases 5 and 7 of their apprenticeship.  This programme will provide up to 400 places over a period of 18 months and is funded by ESB Networks.  To date 236 (104 Phase 5 and 132 Phase 7) redundant apprentices have completed training, 99 (53 Phase 5 and 46 Phase 7) are currently in training and a further 65 Phase 7 redundant apprentices will commence in July 2010</P>
        <P el="5">4. F&Aacute;S and the Institutes of Technology have agreed the PP5 programme for redundant apprentices who have successfully completed Phases 1 &mdash; 4 of their apprenticeship and where an on or off-the-job training opportunity is not currently available.  The programme has both a Construction Stream and an Engineering Stream, with a number of core skills modules related to apprenticeship and a number of electives in specific skills.  The programme provides apprentices with a Level 5 FETAC award and allows for access and transfer of credits to other post-apprenticeship programmes.  The Institutes of Technology are currently providing training to eligible redundant apprentices who responded to invitations issued in January 2010.</P>
        <P el="5">5. F&Aacute;S has also developed Phase 7-equivalent assessments for redundant apprentices at the final phase of their apprenticeship in the trades of Carpentry &amp; Joinery, Electrical, Plumbing, Brick &amp; Stonelaying and Plastering.  To date, 39 redundant apprentices have completed assessments, 30 are currently undertaking assessment, and F&Aacute;S is inviting a further 351 to undertake Phase 7 assessments</P>
        <P el="5">6. Redundant apprentices registered for 4 years who have successfully completed all Phases 1-7 of their apprenticeship, but have not yet completed the required 4 years in employment as an apprentice in the specified trade, will be contacted by F&Aacute;S to submit a portfolio of evidence under Recognition of Prior Learning for consideration by the National Apprenticeship Advisory Sub-committee for the award of the Advanced Craft Certificate.</P>
        <P el="5">7. Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing trade-related specific skills training courses to enhance their employable skills.  They may also avail of the range of trade-related evening courses available in F&Aacute;S Training Centres.</P>
        <P el="5">8. Under the EU Leonardo da Vinci III Lifelong Learning Programme, L&eacute;argas in collaboration with F&Aacute;S, has supported 45 apprentices to date to complete their final on-the-job work placement in companies abroad. 36 redundant apprentices are scheduled for on-the-job work placements by the end of 2010 and a further 15 during the first half of 2011.</P>

	<P>The supply teacher scheme was initially set up at primary level over 15 years ago at a time when schools had difficulty getting substitute teachers.  The supply scheme operates on the basis of an additional full-time teacher being allocated to a school to cover certified sick leave absences in that school and a cluster of neighbouring schools.  If the teacher is not required on a given day to cover sick leave absences they generally assist with other work in their school such as administrative duties.  There are 60 posts allocated to the scheme.</P>
        <P>A value for money review of the Supply Teacher Scheme was published in July 2006.  The review found that approximately 60% of these teachers&rsquo; time was used to cover sick leave absences with the balance on various other school duties.  This reflects the unpredictable nature of sick leave absences.  In relation to the Supply Teacher Scheme, while there are benefits for schools in having these full-time teachers it is considered more cost effective to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences instead of having a cohort of full-time teachers &ldquo;on call&rdquo; all the time in these schools to cover sick leave absences that may or may not arise.</P>
        <P>The employment and appointment of all teachers is a matter for each individual school board of management.  The arrangements for vetting of teaching and non-teaching staff are set out in Department Circular 0094/2006 which issued to all schools in June 2006.  The Circular is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The requirements under the Circular in regard to vetting are not diminished in any way by the policy decision in relation to the value for money consideration that applied to the supply teacher scheme.</P><Col N="799"/>
        <P>There has been ongoing engagement and discussion with the relevant education partners involving my predecessor and/or my senior officials concerning general education matters and specific budgetary matters.  The supply teacher scheme will cease from the start of the 2010/11 school year.  The teachers concerned will be redeployed in accordance with the existing redeployment arrangements to other schools that have vacancies.</P>

	<P>I can confirm the school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for major capital funding which included for the provision of accommodation for an ASD unit.  The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects  and has been assigned a Band 1 rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the <Col N="801"/>project referred to by the Deputy, is now available on my Department&rsquo;s website at  www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

        <P>Recently, the school submitted an application to my Department for temporary accommodation to assist in accommodating its ASD unit and this application is currently being assessed.  The outcome of the assessment process will be communicated to the school authority in due course.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the current difficult economic circumstances have necessitated tough choices to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In these circumstances, from September 2010, as announced in the Budget, all new applicants who are in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses, will be ineligible for student maintenance grants.  The cost of the student services charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met for eligible students by the Exchequer on their behalf.</P>
        <P>Students currently in receipt of the BTEA or VTOS allowances and the maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course provided they continue to meet the terms and conditions of the relevant grant schemes.  Students progressing to a new course with effect from 2010/11 will no longer be eligible for student maintenance grants but can apply for assistance towards the cost of the student services charge and any fees payable.</P>
        <P>Although BTEA students progressing to a new course or new applicants who are in receipt of the BTEA will no longer be able to hold the maintenance portion of the student grant in addition to the BTEA, they may still submit a student grant application to establish entitlement to payment of the student service charge or tuition fees from my Department.  Where a student has indicated that they are currently on the BTEA and are progressing to a new course their application will be assessed to establish their eligibility for the student service charge and tuition fees.</P>
        <P>Where a student has indicated on the application form that they have applied for the BTEA, the application will be processed as normal and the registration fee and tuition fees (where applicable) will be paid on behalf of eligible students to the relevant institution.  The maintenance portion of the grant will be held until such time as the student can confirm that they have received a decision from the Department of Social Protection in relation to the BTEA.</P>
