      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice under Standing Order 32.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom cead a lorg an D&aacute;il a chur ar athl&oacute; faoi Bhuan Ord&uacute; 32 chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an gn&oacute; pr&aacute;inneach agus r&iacute;-th&aacute;bhachtach seo a leanas, the need for immediate emergency action to relocate mentally ill patients from three hospitals deemed by the Mental Health Commission to be unfit for human habitation, and the broader abject failure of the Government to protect the rights and dignity of the mentally ill as evidenced by the commission&rsquo;s finding and by an incident yesterday where a homeless mentally ill woman, having been forcibly released from prison, attempted to rescale the wall of Mountjoy Prison because she had nowhere to go.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Having considered the matter raised, it is not in order under Standing Order 32.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 12, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting victims, repealing Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA, back from committee; No. 13, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the terms of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, back from committee; No. 14, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 and for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, repealing Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA; No. 15, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the terms of three interim economic partnership agreements, back from committee; No. 5, Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 Second Stage (resumed); and No. 16 motion re Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  </P>
        <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 12, 13, 14 and 15 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 5 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 2.45 p.m. today; the proceedings on No. <Col N="624"/>16 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 45 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: the speeches shall be confined to a Minister or Minister of State and to the main spokespersons for Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in, who shall be called upon in that order, who may share their time, and which shall not exceed ten minutes in each case, a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes; Question Time today shall be taken on the conclusion of No. 16 or at 3.30 p.m., whichever is the later and shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m.; and in the event of a Private Notice Question being allowed, it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m. for 30 minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are four proposals to be put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 12, 13, 14 and 15 agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Included in that group is No. 15, with regard to the approval of economic partnership agreements between the European Union and three groups of African countries.  On Tuesday, 25 May 2010, I raised this issue and at the end of the discussion the Taoiseach suggested something which I am afraid was not strictly accurate:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">We are asked to approve the terms of the interim agreements as soon as possible.  All other member states have signed them and the European Community is anxious to implement them in order to ensure compliance with World Trade Organisation rulings.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The agreements have not yet been before the European Parliament, but this is not the most important point.  At the end of the discussion the Taoiseach stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">It is expected that this will be dealt with by the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs.  We have been asked to put the agreements forward for approval.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Taoiseach did not state by whom we were asked, and most importantly he then stated, &ldquo;I can undertake that the matters can be debated in the House when they have been dealt with at committee.&rdquo;  They have been dealt with at committee and yesterday a limited number of Deputies had a good discussion.  Even the Minister of State would agree that it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that a wider number of Deputies in a plenary session of the D&aacute;il have an opportunity to discuss the African issues and the European Union and Africa relationship issues involved.  There is also the question of the Parliament being involved in a vigorous sense in debating policy, particularly in the circumstances we have post-Lisbon treaty.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give an indication that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s words meant something and that we will debate these issues here as promised now that they have come back from committee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to disrupt or delay the Order of Business but I strongly support my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, on this issue on the grounds he has raised.  I will not go over them again.  It is particularly important in the aftermath of the Lisbon treaty that national parliaments such as ours are seen to be playing the role intended for them in the European sphere, in particular with regard to the relationship between the member states of the European Union and other countries, such as those on the African continent.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I advise the Deputy that Standing Order 26(2) is quite explicit on this matter.  One member from each party speaks on the Order of Business.  That is the position.</P>

<P><i>Sitting suspended at 10.41 a.m and resumed at 10.51 a.m.</i></P>
     
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Higgins raised an issue which I understand was the subject of robust debate in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  We provided additional time for that debate but if it is agreeable to the House, I propose that we set aside time after the Order of Business for further discussion on No. 15.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for her offer.  This is a welcome development given the importance of the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>My objection was to the grouping of the motions and not solely to No. 15.  I concur with Deputy Shatter that grouping together various issues in motions taken without debate makes it difficult for us to put our points across.  We are expected to vote for a range of issues without debate.  Two of these issues come from committees.</P>
        <P>I have a problem with the referral to joint committee of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 for approval because this is a matter which we have agreed should be debated in the D&aacute;il.  I seek a commitment from the T&aacute;naiste that it will be debated in this House when it returns from committee.  The matter concerns the suspension of certain rights of people arrested in connection with gangland crimes.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to make a similar commitment to that <Col N="627"/>which she gave on No. 15 so that we can debate the matter in the House.  At least we will be debating the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.</P>
        <P>We should have debated Nos. 12 and 13 in the D&aacute;il and not only in committee because Deputies cannot attend every committee.  As Deputy Shatter noted, the issues arising should be discussed by the entire House rather than in committees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Chief Whip will return to the House with detailed arrangements.  Alternatively, will he outline them now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>They will be discussed at a meeting of the Whips.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to No. 14, we refer matters to joint committees to allow a better discussion to take place on issues of importance.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform, on behalf of the Government, has rightly decided that we will opt into this directive, which is important, and we should not divide the House on the proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Proposal No. 1 is agreed, subject to the modifications suggested.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 5 agreed?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I oppose the guillotine on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.  This is an important Bill and we want more time to discuss it because it is having an awful effect on the poor.  Members of this side of the House are fed up with supplying money to the banks and taking it from the poor.  We oppose the motion and call for a vote on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree fully with Deputy Ring and see great potential for agreement on this side of the House if we can follow this morning&rsquo;s precedent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have no problem with Deputy Gilmore as my T&aacute;naiste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Deputy Ring, I oppose the guillotine on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.  I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the contrasting ways in which different sections of our society are treated by the Government.  Yesterday, the Government announced another &euro;250 million for the EBS and the chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank told an Oireachtas committee that the lion&rsquo;s share of the &euro;22 billion put into his bank will never be seen again.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="628"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>He also said it would cost a further &euro;20 million if we did not put in the money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Never again and then another &euro;22 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Deputy Gilmore to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Tell the full story.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have told us&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy was in power it would cost us &euro;20 billion more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputies should refrain from engaging across the floor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that dealing with the banks would not cost the taxpayer any money.  We spent &euro;22 billion and this man stated that the lion&rsquo;s share will never be seen again.  It seems there is no end to the billions the Government will commit when it comes to the banks and the better off in our society but it will literally not give the poorest the time of day because it is guillotining the debate on issues of concern to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for a brief comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies object to the imposition of a guillotine on Second Stage of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.  The measures proposed in the Bill will present serious difficulties to lone parents and those who depend on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  We resolutely oppose the Bill against the backdrop of yesterday&rsquo;s revelation that, despite all the alleged belt-tightening, former taoisigh are being provided State moneys to employ two special assistants for five years subsequent to their departure from office and one for a lifetime thereafter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a Second Stage debate now.</P>

	<P>It is not agreed to.  Sinn F&eacute;in has objected to renewal of the measures in the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act in each of the years of our representation here, particularly since the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998.  We have made the objection consistently on each occasion on the grounds that this is legislation with no application whatsoever.  It is superfluous to the needs of the legislative measures that exist to address matters that have been or may be addressed under its terms now or at any time in the future.  We would call for the Offences against the State Acts to be removed from the Statute Book.  The Good Friday Agreement committed to remove all repressive legislation from the Stature Books in both jurisdictions &mdash; here and in the neighbouring island.  The continuation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not making it long; it is short and to the point.  The measures in the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 should not be renewed here today.  It would be a statement of confidence in the primacy of the democratic process and peaceful and political pursuit of honourable objectives validly held by Members in this House and people throughout the island if there was sufficient strength among the political voices here to state that we no longer need this legislation.  We believe it was never needed.  We make the case again that it should not be renewed.</P>

	<P>Yesterday the directors of Anglo Irish Bank appeared before Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  They confirmed to the committee that &euro;22 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money had already gone into that bank.  It was appalling to hear that much of that money will not be recovered by the taxpayers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle to give me some latitude this morning because I will be doing this for a long time.  Does the Government plan to continue the taxpayers&rsquo; guarantee for existing bond investors in Anglo Irish Bank after September?  The &euro;22 billion represents three times the budget for the Department of Education and Skills.  It is outrageous that taxpayers are still bailing out this bank and we do not know when it will end.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In the proposed business for next week the Government is back to its old bad habits.  There are six pieces of legislation, which it proposes to guillotine.  We get this coming towards the end of a session with a Government that cannot find enough business for the House to deal with for most of the year.  Last week, for example, we had a short week with truncated business.  When we come to the last few weeks of the session the Government introduces lots of legislation, guillotines it and gets it through as fast as possible.  It is proposed to take the Health (Amendment) Bill 2010 and the European Financial Stability Facility Bill 2010, both of which the Government intends to complete next week.  In other words it seeks to complete all Stages of those two Bills but neither has yet been published.  At a minimum, when will we see these Bills that the Government wants done and dusted in one go next week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The health (amendment) Bill will be published tomorrow and the other legislation was signed off by the Cabinet on Tuesday.  I assume it will be published tomorrow but I will revert to the Deputy on the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Civil Partnership Bill will next come to Report and Final Stages.  My understanding is that all parties support the passage of this Bill so will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that it will come before this House for final passage before the summer recess?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It will go through the House, although it must go through the Seanad first.  We are continuing with the timeframe set down by the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two questions.  One relates to the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2010.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is leaving the Chamber but it is one of his pieces of legislation.  It concerns the process of releasing people from the Central Mental Hospital with some kind of supervision.  Will that come to the D&aacute;il in this session before the summer?</P>
        <P>The revised Limerick regeneration plan was to come before the Cabinet this week.  There seems to be some lack of clarity on whether it was decided.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm if it got the Government&rsquo;s backing and if there is a decision to allocate funding this year in order to implement the regeneration plans in Limerick?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I doubt the legislation will be facilitated this session.  There have been deliberations and the Minister will make an announcement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will an announcement be made this afternoon?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Matters going before the Cabinet are not matters for the Order of Business.  The Government is committed to the delivery of the Limerick regeneration programme and the Minister of State in charge of it will make a public announcement.  I do not have a date for that.</P>

	<P>Another piece of legislation promised to the House and the people and which was to be passed before the summer recess is the psychoactive substances Bill, which is the legislation dealing with head shops.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has just left but when will it be published so we can have a look at it and have enough time to properly debate it in the House on Second Stage?  Given the short time available, it should be left until the autumn to have a proper debate on Committee and Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That legislation was sanctioned by the Cabinet and we are <i>ad idem</i> that the legislation should be passed before the Houses rise for the summer recess.  I am sure we will get the co-operation from everyone to ensure that legislation will get through.</P>

	<P>The Saville inquiry investigated the killing of 14 people in 1972 in Derry, which is very close to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s constituency.  The outcome of that inquiry was welcomed across the political and religious divides.  In 1974, 34 people were killed in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, most in my own constituency in Dublin Central.  The justice committee produced a report, arising from the Judge Barron investigations, requesting that the Government seek through negotiations and meetings with the British Government for the British authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I have two questions.  With regard to the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Bill, the elections were to be held this year, so will the legislation changing the law on the periods come before the House?  When will it come before the House as people want to know if the election will be postponed this year?</P>
        <P>The head shops legislation is very important.  As Deputy Gilmore stated, in the last week of the session we do not want to see guillotines and the House sitting until midnight, with legislation being pushed through before coming to the courts in six months because it is unconstitutional.  The head shop issue is very important and people are very concerned about it.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that we will have enough time to go through the Bill and that it will not be pushed through this House without proper thought and time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to have the head shops legislation on the floor of the House and everyone is anxious for it to be enacted quickly.  The &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta legislation will be this session.</P>

	<P>The Bill on the European stabilisation fund &mdash; a type of IMF for Europe &mdash; is coming before the House on Thursday.  It is an important Bill with implications for Ireland and significant amounts are involved.  We can view this in the context of statements yesterday concerning the &euro;20 billion of the &euro;22 billion given to Anglo Irish Bank having gone down the drain, according to the chief officers of that bank.  We have been given no information or briefing on the matter and I do not know if the European affairs committee has got any either.</P>

	<P>This is on the Order of Business.  It is being rushed in next Thursday and I believe everybody in the House will support it.  Rushing finance Bills with no information or detail on the small print is a recipe for disaster.

	<P>The Minister for Finance has been more than forthcoming in respect of these issues and in briefing his colleagues.  It is appropriate to state that the legislation relating to banking matters that has been passed by the House has been extensive in nature and was the subject of much discussion here.  I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s view that legislation which was passed by the House in the past two years was inappropriate.  It is time people reiterated that if we were to proceed with the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposal in respect of Anglo Irish Bank, the cost to the taxpayer would be &euro;42 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Multi-Unit Developments Bill was due to be taken last week.  We have been waiting six or seven years for this legislation and it is important that the Second Stage relating to it be completed prior to the summer recess.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure this happens?  In view of the number of companies that have gone bust, there are major difficulties for young people in the type of apartment blocks to which the legislation relates.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, who was the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, recently gave an interview in which she appeared to indicate that the referendum on the relevant amendment should be held this year.  She also appealed to the Opposition not to require that the three outstanding by-elections should happen simultaneously.  Is that now the Government&rsquo;s position and will the amendment to the Constitution be the subject of a referendum this year?</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5" Just="Left">which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 12 April 2010.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the debate on these three interim economic partnership agreements, which were approved by the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday.  The D&aacute;il is the only parliament in Europe that will have engaged in extensive discussions on these agreements, which is a welcome development.  The complexity of the agreements is such that they lend themselves <Col N="638"/>to be discussed in committee.  The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs engaged in a strong and robust debate on them yesterday and reached the conclusion that they should be approved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to place on record the historical context relating to these economic partnership agreements and outline why they have been brought before the D&aacute;il for approval.  Historically, the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, countries benefited from very favourable trade preferences with the European Union.  However, these were deemed to violate World Trade Organisation, WTO, rules on the basis that they established an unfair discrimination among developing countries.  In other words, some 77 countries in the ACP region benefited from these unilateral trade preferences but many others that were not members of the ACP grouping did not so benefit.  That was an unfair and illegal form of discrimination.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2000, the European Union and 77 ACP states concluded an agreement known as the Cotonou Agreement.  This provided for a new trade and development framework based on economic partnership agreements.  These are a new type of multilateral agreement, combining both trade and wider development issues in a unified framework and containing reciprocal preferences in trade between the EU and the ACP states.  On this basis, in 2001 the WTO agreed to give a waiver to the EU to continue the unilateral preferences until 31 December 2007.  While that deadline has not been fully observed, it is clear that if progress was not being made in the process relating to concluding economic partnership agreements, unfair discrimination against non-ACP countries would continue.  This would entitle said countries to bring a case to the WTO and this would have a seriously detrimental effect on the international trading system, particularly in the context of developing countries.  That is the background to the debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to make a fundamental point in respect of economic partnership agreements between the EU and developing nations.  Regardless of whether one likes it, we live in an era of globalisation.  Under our globalised trading system, all countries engage in trade with one another.  The amount of goods traded across borders is larger than at any time in the past.  This has benefited many nations.  Unfortunately, the least developed countries have not benefited from the international trading regime that has been in existence for many years.  As a result, it is my strong view that these states do not possess the tools to allow them to rise out of poverty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While development aid is vital for developing countries, many specialists and commentators, academic and otherwise, in the development community agree that, of itself, it will never assist these countries in rising out of poverty.  The only way to relieve poverty in these countries ultimately is by ensuring that they become involved in the international trading regime.  This will assist them in building their trading capacity, their economies and their domestic enterprise systems.  By so doing, they will take part in the international trading system and release themselves from poverty.  I do not accept the contention that these agreements are being rushed through Parliament.  We had a robust debate on them yesterday in committee.  It is important to state that we must comply with international obligations to finalise these agreements which, by their nature, are agreements between the European Union and sovereign states.  We must respect the rights of those sovereign states that wish to enter into these agreements.  While a number of countries have done so, others have stated they are not ready for these agreements at this stage.  We must respect the sovereign wish of those that are ready to agree and sign, which is the reason this motion is before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to debate these issues in plenary session as they go beyond the detailed consideration of a select committee.  At a meeting yesterday of the select committee I suggested we not sign until there had been signature by the African side.  I also stated that in so far as these agreements have not been processed by the European Parliament that the European Parliament&rsquo;s opinion is important, in particular in terms of the connection between development and trade.  </P><Col N="639"/>
        <P>It is important I state immediately that I did not suggest in my contribution yesterday at committee, nor do I do so now on behalf of the Labour Party, that the African countries should rely on development only or that I am against trade.  I am in favour of development that facilitates fair trade and enables renegotiation within a new international economic order or that which takes into account the present situation in regard to economic theory, economic development, economic strategy and economic policy.   In regard to legal obligations, what is at issue is the process.  A number of the countries involved have expressed reservations that are based not on technical details but on fundamentals such as what is required of them by way of timescale in terms of the reduction of tariffs, limited capacity, putting in new charters, the standstill clause, the new clauses in regard to tariffs on, for example, extractive industries and, the protection of infant industries, on which we do not agree in terms of whether this has happened.</P>
        <P>I was influenced at a meeting on 3 June by the east African community which asked Ministers not to sign until these issues have been resolved.  There are issues within the interim economic partnership agreements that will in turn pass on to full economic partnership agreements and there are further implications from what might be regional economic partnership agreements.  There are issues in regard to transparency.  I welcome that we are discussing these; it is what we should be doing.  Ireland has a magnificent and well earned reputation in regard to development practice and theory.  We should be debating where we are in terms of the linking of aid, trade, climate change and so on.  That is the purpose of this debate.  I want this House to engage in full debate on African issues and so on.  I also want us to listen to the debate going on in Africa and to be able, post-Lisbon, to link our debate and the African debate with the European Parliament.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is proposed in the text is not confined to what is required of the World Trade Organisation, WTO.  There are other issues involved.  This opens the door on a whole series of other issues in regard, for example, to services.  There are aspects of the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, which are additional to the WTO.  Without being too technical, there are a whole range of issues involved.  The Labour Party is not suggesting that anybody should break international legal obligations.  We are simply saying let us have a discourse that brings everything forward, is transparent and shows that trade will not operate in such a hegemonic way as to defeat development issues.  Let us not have a discussion on trade that reflects an asymmetrical relationship in regard to negotiation power.</P>
        <P>Many agreements have been bundled together in this motion, which is unusual.  If, for example, an issue had arisen yesterday in regard to Ireland&rsquo;s moment of joining the European Union how would we, if a whole bundle of countries are to be treated the same way, have dealt with this?  The three agreements are not the same.  They are textually different.  Also, they differ in terms of the degree to which they have been processed with only some having been initialled.  There are ways of dealing with the issue.  Only ten countries of the 47 concerned have become involved in any type of EPA process.  We are at one in terms of the everything but arms agreement and the special agreement on preferences.  There are other mechanisms open to us.  It is not a doomsday situation.  If we delay long enough, we will have appropriate input and transparency in Africa, Europe and Ireland.  For this reason, I am happy this motion is being discussed in plenary session.  I hope this is not the last time this will happen.</P>

        <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, on Wednesday, 16 June 2010:</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I was merely referring to our lost colleagues, and I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the correction.</P>
        <P>When I spoke last night I concentrated on the lone parents&rsquo; payment and I wish to make further remarks on that.  I have a deep interest in all matters relating to social and family affairs.  It is where I come from, politically, and I am currently Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, under the guidance and chairmanship of Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae, my good colleague from County Kerry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I make my position clear on these issues.  I have always taken the view that when all boats are rising we must look after the small boats.  When all boats are struggling it is imperative to look after the small boats.  I have often mentioned that I live in Tallaght.  In recent weeks since the publication of the Bill, I have received calls from all over the Dublin region and particularly from my own constituency of Dublin Sout-West.  Many calls came from Tallaght but many also came from rural communities in Brittas and Bohernabreena and from Templeogue, Firhouse and Greenhills.  It is important that we listen to what people are saying and report it, even from the Government benches.  My place in the Chamber is, geographically, on the Labour benches but that is not my decision.  I am happy here, by the way.  I feel warm and wanted.  I am not afraid to say the Government must continue, in all respects, to look after the vulnerable. This should not be a mere slogan.  People are struggling in these hard times.  People who have always struggled must be looked after.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  Other people should make sacrifices to ensure that social inclusion remains part of Government and Opposition policy.</P><Col N="642"/>
        <P>I am conscious, from my dealings in my constituency, that many lone parents will need access to education, training and enabling services, such as child care provision to acquire the skills they will need to gain employment.  A wide range of education and training opportunities is available through the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills and F&Aacute;S, for lone parents to strengthen their qualifications and skills base, maximise their chances of meeting the requirements of the modern labour market and gain employment.</P>
        <P>Social welfare supports for lone parents should continue to be designed to prevent long-term dependence on social welfare and facilitate financial independence.  They should recognise parental choice with regard to the care of young children but with the expectation that parents will not remain outside the labour force indefinitely.  They should include an expectation of participation in education, training and employment, with supports provided in that regard.  The reforms being proposed will help meet those social policy objectives, but the Minister must be particularly proactive to ensure they do.</P>
        <P>The calls I receive from my constituents reflect the fact that people in this category are worried and concerned.  They want to know what will be done for them and they need assurances.  The Minister and the Department say the changes will not take effect for many years in many cases, but people are still worried.  Yesterday, I received a letter from Green Park, in the Greenhills area.  The writer wanted to know who would look after her teenage child and if her family would be safe when the new regulations are in force.  Her point was a fair one and I hope the Minister understands the issues and the concerns of lone parents.</P>
        <P>I listened to the main spokespeople yesterday.  I do not want to praise them in case I get them into trouble, but many fair points were made as to how we should look after people who will be under pressure.  The Minister appeared before the Select Committee on Social and Family Affairs and dealt with the Estimates for his Department.  Questions were put to him by the Opposition spokespeople, Deputies Olwyn Enright and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, and by my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues.  I was glad to hear the Minister was prepared to engage with us.  He made the point that he will continue to engage with the all-party committee and will come back to the committee next week to continue that dialogue.  Those of us who work on the ground know it is important to listen to what people are saying and not to be afraid to represent their concerns in the Oireachtas.  I say to the Minister that we must continue to care and to look after people who need our help.  Those of us who are in a better position to get through the recession should understand the need to help those who are vulnerable.  I hope we will continue to do that.</P>
        <P>I have already referred to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  I am proud to be its vice chairman.  With an all-party approach, the committee has launched a number of reports, including one on social welfare fraud which received much attention and raised considerable debate.  Deputies Olwyn Enright and Thomas Byrne issued a comprehensive report on the high levels of indebtedness in Irish society.  We took a radical approach in those reports.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have made the point to the Minister on more than one occasion &mdash; I repeated it yesterday &mdash; that a specific category of citizens of this country is now looking for social welfare assistance.  I hope the people in question are not offended when I say I regard them as the &ldquo;new poor&rdquo;.  They were doing well six months or a year ago &mdash; they were in employment, they could go on holidays, they were able to go to see Manchester United on a regular basis, they had no difficulties with their bills and commitments and they certainly had no difficulties with their mortgages.  It has come as a bolt from the blue for them to have to struggle in this manner.  As I have said previously, I try to bring my own experiences to my own politics.  I was made redundant three times and had to reinvent myself each time.  If it happens again, I will cope.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>My experiences give me an appreciation of the substantial challenges faced by people who are suddenly faced with having to queue outside their local dole office, where everybody can see them.  They have to deal with their bills and, particularly, their mortgages in those circumstances.  I have no sympathy for financial institutions that go after such people.  When the managing director of the EBS addressed an Oireachtas committee, he made some positive and radical proposals for dealing with debt.  I challenge him and his counterparts in the other institutions to put their money where their mouths are by looking after people who are struggling.  We need to consider the various proposals in this regard which have been made by Deputies on all sides of the House.  I hope the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, is in his office watching my contribution and wondering what I will say next.  When he came to Tallaght a few weeks ago, it was his first trip out into the real world after his appointment as Minister for Social Protection.  We were delighted to welcome him to Tallaght.</P>

	<P>He is coming to Swords shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.  I have no problem with showing the way in Tallaght, which is a great example of how the job should be done.  Following his successful visit to Tallaght, the Minister intends to go all over the country, including Swords.  I suspect he will go to Limerick and other areas.  When the Minister came to Tallaght, he met a group of people who gathered to tell it as it is.  It was not a Fianna F&aacute;il group.  I am sorry if that offends anybody.  We discussed what should be done about social welfare benefits and other priorities.  The point was strongly made that people do not want to stay on social welfare.  People want employment, education and schemes.  I hope the Minister will follow through on the points he has made on more than one occasion, including at the meeting in Tallaght and at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Select Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  I refer, for example, to his suggestion that the need to prepare people to go back into the workforce will be prioritised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The critics will say there are no jobs out there, which highlights the fact that employment is the major issue in this context.  The next election may well be a case of &ldquo;the economy, stupid&rdquo;, but it should also be about jobs.  There are almost 11,000 unemployed people, including many young people, in my community of Tallaght.  We need to give people hope.  We should grasp the nettle when it comes to this issue, rather than merely talking about it.  I appreciate that it falls under the remit of other Departments, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, has a clear role to play in this regard.  I will continue to make these points to him, as I did to his predecessor.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, also has a role to play as far as this challenge is concerned.  He knows it would be good for people to get back to work.  He knows it would be good for the country if people did not have to depend on his Department to look after them.  It would relieve the burden on the State as well.  The Minister has mentioned all sorts of ideas about getting people back into work.  I strongly support the community employment and job initiative schemes because it is important to give people an opportunity to do something meaningful.  We all know that many jobs need to be done in communities throughout the country.  Therefore, volunteerism needs to be supported.  All kinds of activities, including summer camps for young people and initiatives for older people, are being pursued in our communities at present.</P><Col N="644"/>
        <P>I listened to the comments that were made in the House last night about the proposal to reduce the jobseeker&rsquo;s payments of those who do not find work or take up opportunities.  I hope the Minister and the Department will be flexible in this regard.  If no jobs are available, one cannot penalise or punish people who cannot find work.  I would never pick on social welfare staff, and certainly not the people in the fine office in Tallaght.  However, the system needs to be flexible.  We have to try to encourage people, look after them and make sure they are treated properly.  I appreciate the courtesy that has been extended to me by the Chair.  I look forward to supporting this Bill.</P>

	<P>The Government is a broad church.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is a very broad church, especially in Tallaght, where Deputy O&rsquo;Connor comes from.  His final remarks were magnificent.  He said that if there are no jobs, we cannot impose sanctions on people who do not take up jobs.  I agree that rather than punishing people, the Government should be flexible in relation to this matter.  There is no flexibility in this legislation, unfortunately.  It does not provide for an appeals mechanism.  The flexibility sought by Deputy O&rsquo;Connor has been specifically left out.  I am not as happy as he seems to be saying that the Minister will continue to engage with the joint committee on the matter.  I have not yet seen any sign that the Minister will be flexible in his engagement.  I am glad he has visited Tallaght.  I am sure Deputy O&rsquo;Connor showed him what real life is like there.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 is another example of the harsh medicine being applied by the Government.  Its approach to dealing with the economic crisis is to impose austerity measures on the unemployed and the less well-off.  We saw this in 2009, when two miserable budgets targeted the less well-off, the sick, the disadvantaged, the unemployed and pensioners.  Believe it or not, two social welfare Bills were introduced as part of that process.  I suggest that there has been a superfluity of legislation of this nature in recent years.</P>
        <P>This Bill again puts the boot into the less well-off, including unemployed people, young people, lone parents and their children.  This legislation is entirely negative.  It does not contain a positive line or offer any incentives.  There is not a carrot anywhere.  It is all about targeting people at the lower end of the scale, who are on social welfare, by and large.  They will be made to suffer as they try to move away from a reliance on jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  They will have to pay for the decisions of those who have ruined this economy and the lives of so many people.</P>
        <P>It is impossible to come up with one good word for this despicable Bill.  It is interesting that it was published on 28 May 2010 and will be guillotined today, 17 June 2010.  It appears to have taken approximately three weeks to ram through a Bill of this nature, at a time when we have <Col N="645"/>been trying to get the Government to establish a commission of inquiry into the notorious and nefarious decisions that brought about the collapse of the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>Critical decisions were made in September 2008, almost two years ago, but the commission of inquiry has not yet been set up or its terms of reference decided.  Nor has legislation been introduced to name and shame, punish or sanction the people responsible.  It is sauce for the goose but not sauce for the gander.  There is one approach for those at one end of the scale and another for those at the other end.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the meantime, what has happened?  The economy has been ruined and tens of thousands of householders are in negative equity, with homes they bought during the construction bubble that was created by the financial institutions.  To make it worse, in the last two years 200,000 people have become unemployed.  Last year 40,000 emigrated; this year the ESRI estimates that 60,000 will emigrate.  That is worse, in such a short space of time, than anything we have experienced before.  Now a provision has been introduced under which people must accept reasonable offers of jobs &mdash; jobs that are not available.  Placements and college places are also not available.  In April 2009, the Government promised to create 2,000 work placements.  How many has it delivered so far?  A total of 919 &mdash; less than half the number promised.  There are people begging for work placements.  Similarly, in 2009, 2,500 extra college places were promised for young jobseekers; a total of 1,752 were created, which is nowhere near what was promised &mdash; in fact, almost 1,000 less.</P>
        <P>We know there are no jobs.  The number of jobless people is increasing, or people are emigrating.  Yet this Bill states that people must take up a reasonable offer of a job.  What is the definition of a reasonable offer, especially if there are no jobs in the first place?  Why produce legislation in a vacuum?  Why not stimulate the economy in certain areas to facilitate people with certain skills who are unemployed?  These people could get back to work quickly.  Let us create these jobs, placements and college and back-to-education positions, and let us fit people into them, rather than adopting an inflexible approach of applying sanctions with no consideration for the reality of the situation.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Connor put it well when he asked why we should impose sanctions on people who refuse job offers when there are no jobs out there.  This legislation, in sections 17, 18, 23 and 24, targets people in a cold fashion.  For example, let us consider sections 17 and 18, which deal with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  In last year&rsquo;s budget, this allowance was halved for young people between the ages of 18 and 21.  Now a quarter of the allowance has been removed again, so that it has been brought down to &euro;100 and then to &euro;75 from the 2004 level &mdash; a drastic reduction.  It is difficult to see active young people surviving on that.  They need money for clothes and activities; even when looking for jobs they will need money for bus fares and so on.  It is not realistic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The further reduction for those aged 22 to 24 is &euro;35, while for those over 24 it is &euro;46.  Thus, the entire category of young people between the ages of 18 and 25 has been targeted.  The idea is to push them out to find work that is not there.  If they do not find the work that is not there, we get rid of them &mdash; get them out of the country.  Around 100,000 people have left the country in the space of two years.  They are the brightest and best.  We are exporting them again as we did in the 1950s, the 1970s and the 1980s, but this time it is more concentrated, and legislation has been introduced to force them out.  We are shunning the young people of our country in a crude fashion.  We are telling them they are not wanted; that they are a burden on the State.  We are telling them to get our or starve.  That is the message that is coming from this legislation.</P>
        <P>We are justifying this based on a refusal to accept a reasonable offer of employment, although reasonable offers of employment are not forthcoming.  There is nothing in this or any other legislation that works pragmatically towards job creation or stimulation, or the provision <Col N="646"/>of opportunities or placements for education and training.  Community employment schemes have been cut even though increasing numbers of people are seeking them.  Lone parents can no longer get onto CE schemes even though they should account for 10% of such schemes.  That is not the case any longer.</P>
        <P>We have seen cutbacks in so many areas, including funding for librarians in disadvantaged areas &mdash; although, thankfully, the Department of Finance has reversed this decision.  A small number of disadvantaged schools were benefiting from the new library project, but the information was that great progress was being made by youngsters, particularly in literacy and numeracy but also in terms of educational confidence.  The project has been operating successfully in a number of schools in my own constituency.  I am pleased that in the last couple of days the Department of Finance has agreed to make the required funding, which had been cut entirely from August of this year, available in the coming year.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy O&rsquo;Connor I will mention my own constituency, Dublin Central, where there are quite large numbers of unemployed people and lone parents.  Youngsters are coming out of school seeking employment or training, but they cannot find it.  For example, one of the things I did myself was to set up, last year, a soccer club in Liberty House for 20 to 30 young men aged 18 to 25 who have nothing to do and want to do something useful.  The club won the league and got to the cup final, so it did extremely well.  Such a project keeps young people off the streets when there is nothing else to do in an area.  Dublin is the European capital of sport this year, and funding was put into sport to give people &mdash; especially young people, who are full of energy and action &mdash; alternative activities.  Particularly in disadvantaged areas, this prevents them from hanging around with nothing to do all day every day.  All the Government is offering them is a reduction in their jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for not taking up employment which is not available to them in the first place.  It is a disaster.</P>
        <P>I received documentation from the Daughters of Charity at St. Vincent&rsquo;s on the Navan Road, which provides services for people with intellectual disabilities.  They have just been informed, in the middle of 2010, that &euro;4 million is being cut from their funding by the HSE.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the beginning of the year the organisation expected to have &euro;4 million more than it has.  It must channel into a six-month period the cuts that were announced suddenly.  The cutbacks will be sharper because it was not told at the beginning of the year that this would happen.  Some 56 posts must be cut by the end of the year.  There is also the threat of an additional sanction of 5% if it does not comply.  Care for senior citizens and respite care for the intellectually disabled will be curtailed, family support hours will be significantly reduced, collect after school clubs will be significantly reduced, summer camps will not be supported, there will be no transport for children with intellectual disabilities, a skills development programme will have to close for weeks and staff have been told they must take a week off at their own expense or be deployed elsewhere.  This is very heavy, coming in the middle of the year.</P>
        <P>These cutbacks are taking place all the time.  This type of legislation is targeting young people and lone parents and is making a wonderful statement through the publication of fraud in the social welfare system.  Names, addresses and the amounts of fines will be published.  Would it not be great if we had this across the board so that it applied to all companies and all people exploiting the system?  For example, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, is constantly finding companies, businesses and personnel exploiting people in the workplace.  Would it not be great if we had the same commitment in the legislation to a monthly publication of the names, addresses and the amounts of fines for those people?  That is not done but we will have that in respect of social welfare as if this was the one major crime.  The amount of social welfare fraud committed is much less, on a relative scale, than the fraud committed by larger operators in terms of employees, businesses, hotels and so on.  Let us have this measure <Col N="647"/>implemented across the board.  I am entirely in favour of naming and shaming those exploiting the system through fraud but let us not just target those who are less well off.  Let us target the heavyweights in the economy, the so-called pillars of society and ensure they are named and shamed.  This should be done on a regular basis.  NERA identifies people in its annual report each year and is in a position to do so because it has been put on a statutory footing.  NERA should produce a monthly publication so we can see in the newspapers a list of the great and the good of Irish society and how they behave.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the most unkind cut of all, in the one-parent family payment, which will now end when the youngest child is aged 13 years.  Where did that cut-off point come from?  The 13th year is the first year as a teenager, the bridge between primary school and second level.  Children are particularly vulnerable at this point and need all the support they can get, as do parents.  Why is this inexplicable instrument used at this time?  What will it do and what will it affect?  It will not create employment for the parent.  What will it do for the child?  Will it force a child out of school?  It beggars belief that proposals of this nature can be made.  It is anti-child, anti-mother and anti-family.</P>
        <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has some experience of the constitutional protection of the family.  There is a strong case to be made about the constitutionality of this measure.  It targets the children of lone parents, as though there is some stigma.  They are being hit at an early stage.  At present, the lone parent&rsquo;s allowance continues until 18 years of age if the child is in education and continues until 22 years of age if the child is in third level education.  Reducing the age from 22 to 13 is a considerable cut, nine years.  The chance of that child going to third level education is now nil.  There is no chance if the lone parent&rsquo;s allowance will not be made from the age of 13 years.  This is negative legislation and is not what we need at this moment.  It would be best if this legislation was withdrawn and the Minister went back to the drawing board.</P>

	<P Just="Left">T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och duit as deis labhairt ar an mBille seo.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I have listened intently to Deputy Costello.  As a Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher, I am very proud of the record of the Fianna F&aacute;il Governments over the past 12 years on the issue of welfare benefits.  The current budget is almost &euro;21 billion.  When we consider inflation was of the order of 40% over those 12 years, the State old age pension benefit increased by 120%, unemployment benefit increased by 130% and child benefit increased by 330%.  That is a phenomenal record and rather than being critical of Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, Deputy Costello should recognise that Ireland is way ahead of its European counterparts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">For example, the state pension in the UK is &pound;95 and our benefit is &euro;230.  There is a substantial difference, which was highlighted in the recent British general election.  In the first leaders&rsquo; debate, a question was asked from the audience whether any candidate would consider increasing the benefit.  Effectively, the answer was that they would not because they believed it was reasonable and that the country could not afford an increase.  Criticising the Irish Government and a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government for having the highest level of state benefit in Europe is farcical.</P><Col N="648"/>
        <P Just="Left">My view on State benefit is that no Government should consider reducing it.  Our senior citizens built up our country and paid taxes.  They brought Ireland to where it is and the Minister should not countenance a reduction, notwithstanding the severe budgetary deficit that leaves us borrowing another &euro;20 billion this year to bridge our finances.</P>
        <P>Regarding child benefit, and considering the resources available, we must consider whether people earning high incomes should receive the same level of benefit as those without a job.  I make this point to broaden the debate.</P>
        <P>From meetings at clinics in my consittuency two issues of concern arise, namely, fraud and the issue of child benefit to single parents.  The discussion we are having now is worthwhile and it is correct for us to have an informed debate and get the facts.  In regard to fraud in the welfare system, last year more than &euro;100 million was saved through the actions of the staff and officials of the Department, which is very welcome.  It is what taxpayers and the public at large expect us to do.  I congratulate the Department and exhort the staff to continue that work.  In any aspect of our society fraud should not be permitted and I want to see scarce resources going where they should go.</P>
        <P>In recent months I have been told of a number of instances of people flying in from Europe as daytrippers to collect their payments.  The suggestion is that these people are not entitled to the money.  If they are then they are entitled to collect it but if not they should be stopped.  It was suggested to me that in the same way that Revenue and other sections are at the airport checking out people coming into the country, the Department of Social Protection should put officials with laptops there who would be allowed to question people coming off aeroplanes in order to establish whether they are coming here on holidays or for what people regard as a rip-off situation.  I make that suggestion to the Minister and his officials so that it might be investigated as we endeavour to cut down on fraudulent payments.  I believe it is worth a try and hope the Minister will consider it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Along with my colleagues in the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party I have had a number of discussions with the Minister and am particularly interested in trying to utilise the skills of self-employed people who, unfortunately, are on dole queues at the moment.  They get no automatic right to benefit at present and, having talked to a number of these people, I am of the opinion they would be willing to contribute to the system and pay a bit more on the basis that they would be allowed to claim benefit if they got into the unfortunate situation of being out of work.  As other speakers have noted, there are a number of activities in all our constituencies around the country at present where work is not being done.  These highly skilled self-employed people, whether carpenters, plumbers, plasterers, bricklayers or whatever they may be, could do invaluable work.  I believe they would be ready, willing and able, as the clich&eacute; has it, to carry out that work if the system permitted.  I would like the Minister to investigate ways whereby some of these people might do 19 and a half hours&rsquo; work, or perhaps longer hours, carrying out works for the benefit of their community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This would have a dual effect.  First, well-needed works could be carried out in localities at no cost to the State in return for the welfare payments.  Equally, it would give some self-respect to those unfortunate people who have no work at present and who feel bad about having to stay at home with nothing to do.  I say to the Minister and his officials this is an issue we should fast-track and whatever laws, rules or regulations need to be changed we should get over them because of the dual benefit, both to the people who are claiming benefit at present and the communities where work is badly needed.  I could speak for the next hour about works all around my constituency which need to be done and which I would like to see done.</P><Col N="649"/>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Costello castigated the Government on this Bill but, again, he has not compared the Irish situation with our European counterparts.  When one examines what is happening throughout Europe, and across the water in the United Kingdom, one sees that the proposals planned by the Government are more than reasonable.  In the UK, to which we are often compared in many respects, from September the benefit for a lone parent will cease when the child reaches the age of seven.  This came about under a socialist Government and I have not heard that the new Tory-Liberal Democrat Government plans to change it.  There is realism, and keeping people at home, unemployed and drawing benefit is not the way forward.  What the Government is planning is reasonable and pragmatic.</P>
        <P>Equally, if one compares Ireland with European countries, Norway, Sweden and Germany cease benefit when the child reaches the age of three.  Our proposal is for the age of 13 and I have an open mind about whether the age should be 15.  However, when one looks at the UK situation which will reduce the age in question to half what we propose, and at Norway, Sweden and Germany which have the age at a quarter of what we propose, it is not unreasonable that we should consider this measure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I say this for two reasons.  First, we need to prioritise upskilling, training and education for single parents.  This is the best way forward in meeting both the needs of these people and those of society.  I have met many single mothers and have a great deal of sympathy for those who find themselves in a situation with a child, no job and without family backup whereby if they could get a job they might take it up.  There is no financial incentive for people to take up a job if, as at present, they are able to claim benefit.  That financial bottom line makes one much better off.  We must consider the needs of society and of the person.  Asking any young mother to get more education and upskill herself in a particular trade or business is for her own benefit and also for the benefit of society in general.  It uses resources to better effect.</P>
        <P>In the overall  welfare situation, carers, pensioners and disabled people need maximum Government support and we must target our resources more effectively.  In this regard I wish to reiterate the great record Fianna F&aacute;il has had with regard to benefits.  If we compare the State benefit of &euro;230 versus that in the UK, it shows we are way ahead of Britain and Europe.  Last year, the Government reduced the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to &euro;150 where those persons would not take up job offers, or would not undergo training and up-skilling.  I welcome that move because people need a financial incentive to make a choice.  Do they stay at home and draw the dole or do they further their education, engage in training and up-skilling to be in a position to obtain a job?</P>
        <P>I welcome the move to bring F&Aacute;S and all its training programmes under this new Department of Social Protection.  Every aspect of welfare, be it payments, training, up-skilling and so on, should be under one umbrella and the Government has made the right decision in bringing the responsibilities under two previous Departments into the Department of Social Protection.  Challenging ourselves to cut down long-term unemployment must be the aim.  It is not good for the individual to have nothing to look forward to when he or she gets up every morning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to make the right decisions to deal with the long-term unemployed.  Incentivising people to up-skill, to educate themselves and to retrain is necessary because if we are not given an incentive to do something, we will take the easy option.  This Bill is going a long way towards that.  The financial penalty is the best way of incentivising a person.  The reduction in the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance from &euro;196 to &euro;150 is one way of giving the person a choice to go out and get retrained or to sit at home and draw the cheque.</P>
        <P>Statistics on poverty show that children from single parent homes are four times more likely to remain in poverty when they reach maturity.  They are likely to fall into the same traps as their predecessors.  That must be a concern of any Government for the future.  The new rules <Col N="650"/>in respect of 13 year old children will come about in 2024.  Thirteen years is a reasonable timeframe for a single parent to re-educate, up-skill and retrain.  If the single parent has gained a qualification in education at the end of the 13 years, then that is good for the parent and for society.  A six year lead in for existing customers is a reasonable timeframe to up-skill and retrain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s plans on the new community child care subvention.  In any situation involving lone parents, child care is a very important facet.  Anything that has a  labour activation focus has to be correct and I welcome that.  Part of the Bill deals with the after school services and the home care clubs.  People need that backup service and it is a particularly important aspect of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Home-Start service is currently available in Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown, and it has recently been introduced to Swords, where one manager and a core number of volunteers help people in need, including single parents.  They work on a minimum budget and they provide excellent value for money to the State.  The salaried manager and the volunteers do fantastic work and the Minister should consider extending the services of these groups, fund the facility in Swords, and we will get value out of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government&rsquo;s claim to be introducing measures to discourage people from defrauding the taxpayer might carry more weight were it not for its actions in other areas.  Only yesterday, the new management at Anglo Irish Bank admitted that we are unlikely ever to see a return on much of the money that has been pumped into repairing the criminal negligence of those who were there before the State had to intervene.  It is ironic that this Government seems to have no problem nationalising banks and having the State pay for the mistakes of incompetent members of the so-called elite but is embarked on a moral crusade against public service workers and those on social welfare, including many who have directly lost their jobs as a consequence of that incompetence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The lesson clearly is that if one was lucky enough to be a member of the so-called golden circle of criminally incompetent financial and property speculators, then one can expect to have one&rsquo;s tab picked up by the taxpayers, but those who directly lost their jobs as a result of the manner in which those people destroyed the economy then will have to do with even less than that to which they are currently entitled in social welfare.</P>
        <P>The former leader of Fianna F&aacute;il was wont every now and again to describe himself as a socialist.  The former Deputy Joe Higgins was quite amusing about that, but perhaps he misunderstood what Deputy Bertie Ahern was referring to.  There are many different types of socialism and clearly what we have here is a socialism of the failed millionaire class.</P>
        <P>I am not arguing that there is no such thing as social welfare fraud, nor that people who are guilty of defrauding the system ought not to be brought to book.  People who defraud the system are committing an offence and directly impacting on those who are genuinely entitled to support.  We have seen many people imprisoned in the past for small amounts of social welfare fraud, but we have not yet seen the bankers, developers or the golden circle of the political elite brought to book for their crimes against the Irish people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill makes cuts to the lone parent payment scheme.  It seems the Government now wants to punish families who have growing teenagers.  The Minister has claimed that the changes are aimed at addressing the high number of lone parent households in poverty.  I would welcome steps to address this level of poverty, but sadly this Bill is not an anti-poverty measure.  It is the opposite.  It is an unscrupulous, penny pinching measure, primarily directed against the less well-off in our society.</P><Col N="651"/>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill is not about moving people off welfare and into paid employment because the job, education and training opportunities simply do not and will not exist on the basis of current Government policy.  It is about moving lone parents from one welfare payment and onto another less flexible, less supportive and unsuitable payment.  This will also have severe and counterproductive consequences for lone parent claimants in low paid part-time employment.  There is no denial that the lone parent payment scheme is in major need of reform.   The Government&rsquo;s own 2006 report, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents<i>,</i> contained a range of recommendations including a recommendation that the age of qualifying children be lowered.  However, that report clearly stated that any such move must be accompanied by ensuring that child care supports are available.  Even the Minister has admitted that the availability of after school and summer supervision support is patchy at best.  The 2006 report also stated that the selection of a particular cut-off age is a matter for decision by Government following a consultation process. Where was the consultation process?  Why pick 13 years as the cut off age?  Research conducted by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice into the cost of a minimum essential standard of living clearly demonstrates that households with adolescents spend more on food, social inclusion and education than households with younger children.  What then is the logic behind this?  Does the Government expect all single parents to rush into marriage before their children reach the age of 13?  Perhaps it envisages a situation where all 13 year olds will, in a few years time, be able to get full-time jobs working for its gombeen friends overcharging people for coffee and breakfast rolls, if and when the economy ever recovers.</P>
        <P>The Minister might think he will make savings with these penny pinching, but he should not kid himself; over the longer term if parents are forced to cut spending on these essentials, he is storing up far more costly problems for society in the future.  However, that thinking seems to be completely absent on the Government side, where the whole focus appears to be on how to take more from those who have the least.  That is what underlies the proposals to cut social welfare, and also what lies behind the earlier signalled intent of the Government to allow employers to opt out of agreed minimum wage rates.</P>
        <P>There seems to be no understanding that by driving people, including more people who are working, further into poverty overall society is damaged, and all for the purpose of ensuring that a small number of people at the top will continue to make money.  It is not just a short-sighted policy, it is an anti-social one, and one that I suggest would not have gone down well with previous Fianna F&aacute;il Cabinets which were attacked not for cutting social welfare payments and programmes but for increasing them.  They were attacked by the very same sort of people whose interests Fianna F&aacute;il now seems to have as its priority.  These were the people who in the 1930s claimed that they could not afford to take their money out of London&rsquo;s Stock Exchange and banks and invest it here because the tenement dwellers of Ireland would have no incentive to work for buttons if they were given outrageous luxuries like proper housing, schools and hospitals.  We now hear the very same arguments from people who are of the opinion that the only way to get the economy working again is to force people to work for a few hundred euro a week and as part of that to reduce social welfare far below what it isnow.</P>
        <P>In theory this may make sense but it overlooks a few important facts.  Do these people realise that low income earners, social welfare recipients and single parent payment recipients spend every cent in the local economy, and by doing so they create employment?  Much of the growth during the Celtic tiger was in highly skilled and well paid employment and a large proportion of that came from overseas investment in technology and other sectors.  The economy did not grow on the basis of employing demoralised brow beaten poorly educated people on low wages, as IBEC and ISME and their cheerleaders in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael would have us believe.</P><Col N="652"/>
        <P>The greatest contribution of some of our native entrepreneurs was to piggyback on the genuine growth in the economy by charging us exorbitant amounts for everything from mortgages to rents to pints of lager and paninis, while being careful at the same time to ensure they paid as little as possible in tax or wages.  These are the patriots whose bacon the so-called republican party proposes to save by imposing a massive drop in living standards on the decent people of this country, whose only crime was to work when there was work only to suffer the indignity of unemployment when the work was gone.  Unlike many of our great elite, they could not avoid the obligations of citizens by departing into tax exile.  Perhaps more of them ought to have followed the elite&rsquo;s example and engaged in the anti-national and criminal activities that have brought this country to its knees.  It seems this is what earns one the respect and help of the Government.</P>
        <P>I call on people to oppose the measures proposed in this Bill.  Not only will they not contribute anything towards the objectives claimed by the Minister, but they will make things much worse by contributing to a further undermining of the social fabric.  The measures also contrast to the manner in which the Government has mollycoddled those responsible for the scale of the current mess in which we find ourselves.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Niall Blaney.  I am pleased to speak today on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.  Yesterday, I listened with interest to my friend and colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, outline the main provisions of this important Bill.  I am very aware of the work of his Department as it impacts on almost every person in the State on a daily basis.  It is a proactive Department, the workings of which I am very familiar with through my constituency office.  The Department administers 50 different schemes and services with more than 1.5 million people benefiting from weekly payments and more than 580,000 families receiving child benefit in respect of 1.1 million children each month.  Fianna F&aacute;il is proud of its record of supporting those most in need in our society.  As the Minister said yesterday in his address, over the past 12 years, we have increased pension rates by approximately 120%, unemployment benefits by almost 130% and child benefit payments by more than 330%.  The cost of living has increased by approximately 40% over the same period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are a number of elements in the Bill which I would like to touch on briefly.  One of the changes which I believe will be tabled as a Committee Stage amendment is a very practical transfer of work schemes across to the Department of Social Protection, so that the Minister can have a focus on job activation.  The Minister will also introduce an amendment to provide him with the necessary statutory powers on the employment services and community services programme of F&Aacute;S.  I welcome this joined-up approach to looking at job activation in its wider context with income support.  There are real and particular provision needs in communities that we could address through these schemes.  One of the great challenges faced at present, not just in my area of Longford-Westmeath but throughout the country, is where families have gone from having two incomes to one, or worse, from one income to none.  It is important that we have work opportunities for people caught in this situation.</P>
        <P>What struck me in particular about the discussion on the one-parent family payment is the fact that statistics show that many lone parents are in poverty.  This is despite significant State spending by successive Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers on one-parent families as well as improvements made to the one-parent family payment over the years.  The latest EU-SILC figures show that in 2008, 17.8% of lone parents experienced consistent poverty compared to 3% of two-parent households and to 4.2% of the population as a whole.  The cost of the one-parent family payment scheme in 2009 was &euro;1.12 billion.  When other supports are taken into account, including <Col N="653"/>child benefit and, where appropriate, rent supplement and family income supplement, total expenditure in this area exceeded &euro;2 billion that year.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>If, after all that investment, lone parents are still in a cycle of poverty then we have to change our way of assisting them and improving their quality of life.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In general, the best route out of poverty is through paid employment.  It is recognised that work, and especially full-time work, may not be an option for parents of young children.  However, it is believed that supporting parents to participate in the labour market once their children have reached an appropriate age will improve their economic situation and their social well-being and that of their families.  The current arrangements, whereby a lone parent can receive the one-parent family payment until his or her child is 18 years of age or 22 years of age if he or she is in full-time education without any requirement for them to engage in employment, education or training, are not in the best interests of the parent, the children or society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the new proposals, the one-parent family payment will be paid until the youngest child in the family reaches 13 years of age.  It was initially proposed in the Government discussion paper on proposals for supporting lone parents in 2006 that a parental allowance would continue until the youngest child reached seven years of age.  For existing recipients, payment will be phased out over a six year period.  I welcome this phasing out period.  It is important to say that this is a phased change and recipients should not have anxiety about this change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the youngest child reaches 13 years of age if the parent is still in need of support he or she will be entitled to claim jobseekers allowance, or if in low-paid employment of 19 hours or more per week, family income supplement.  I welcome also that notification to existing recipients will be put in place advising them of changes to the scheme and a reminder will issue to relevant recipients when their youngest child reaches the age of ten encouraging them to avail of educational, training and back to employment opportunities.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious that many lone parents will need access to education, good quality relevant training and child care to acquire the skills they will need to gain employment.  There are a wide range of education and training opportunities available through the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Education and Skills and F&Aacute;S for lone parents to strengthen their qualifications and skills base and thus maximise their chances of meeting the requirements of our modern labour market.  Currently, all lone parents who use F&Aacute;S employment services are provided with a one-to-one guidance interview with an employment services officer.  As part of this process, lone parents are advised on current job vacancies, suitable training or employment programme places and may be referred to other F&Aacute;S supports.</P>
        <P>A new support approach, the social inclusion model, to help people to overcome barriers and to increase their opportunities to access training, employment programmes and, ultimately the labour market, is currently being tested by F&Aacute;S with lone parents.  This model involves a number of agencies including lone parent organisations and includes outreach information and recruitment and a &ldquo;paving your way to work&rdquo; programme concerned with the provision of information supports regarding welfare to work, budgeting, education and work options.  The programme is aimed at individuals who are parenting alone.  It is eight weeks in duration, is delivered from 9.30 a.m to 1 p.m. and mirrors calendared school holidays.</P>
        <P>I am aware that good progress has been made on the provision of child care.  The Government invested &euro;1 billion over the past decade in developing a child care infrastructure under the national child care investment programme 2006-10 and, prior to that, the European Union co-funded the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-06.  As a result of these programmes, some 65,000 child care places will be available this year.  This investment has made <Col N="654"/>it possible to introduce the free early childhood care and education, ECCE, year for pre-school children.</P>
        <P>In addition, the community child care subvention scheme, CCSS, funds community child care facilities to enable them to charge reduced child care fees to disadvantaged and low-income families.  Almost 1,000 community services are now in the CCSS, the number of full-time equivalent children attending is almost 30,000 and the number of parents using the services is nearly 18,000.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallBlaneyIND"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Blaney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to add my voice to the debate on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.  There is no doubt that we are experiencing changed times which naturally trigger a need for changes to our social welfare payments.  The economic downturn has left people in situations that they never dreamed possible.  Ireland experienced unprecedented levels of employment in recent years, which left us in a situation whereby those on social welfare benefits were truly those that were in need, such as carers, pensioners, people with disabilities and so on.</P>
        <P>During those times this Government dramatically increased levels of social welfare payments, a point which was outlined by the Minister and many of my colleagues.  Over the past 12 years we have increased unemployment benefits by almost 130%, child benefit by more than 330% and pension rates by approximately 120%.  In contrast, the cost of living has increased by about 40% in the same period.  The generosity of our welfare system was demonstrated in recent times when many people from Northern Ireland unlawfully claimed welfare in Border counties such as Donegal.  I very much welcome the measures introduced by the Minister to clamp down on such activity.  It highlighted the enormous variation in welfare payments between here and the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>Many people are now experiencing difficult times for the first time, especially our younger generations.  Others are experiencing difficult times for the first time in quite some time.  Currently we have a situation whereby many people in receipt of social welfare payments truly want to get back into the workforce or education and training.  We have new graduates fresh out of college who cannot obtain work, even though they are eager to put their knowledge to use.  There are solicitors, teachers, accountants, architects and many more professional people finding themselves in need of support.</P>
        <P>This leaves us in a situation where we not only have to consider those that are unable to participate in employment or education but also those that are willing to do so and fail to secure employment, education and training.  We had a situation recently in Letterkenny where a local cafe advertised a job for a dishwasher and received more than 400 applications.  That demonstrates the willingness of our people to work and we must assist them effectively.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are living in difficult times but, given the current signs I am confident of an upturn.  Things are progressing.  Meanwhile, we must assist those in receipt of social welfare payments to prepare to take advantage of employment opportunities when they arise.  Some &euro;20.9 billion will be spent by this Government in 2010 on social welfare provision, an increase of &euro;500 million over 2009.  While we are under pressure in budgetary terms, we are also conscious of the massive increase in numbers of those in need of help at this time.  This Bill is a commendable endeavour to address the requirements of the most needy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are also extremely conscious of discouraging long-term dependence upon social welfare.  This can be a scourge in any country and I commend the Minister&rsquo;s measures to curb it in this Bill.  We are not in the business of making any individual or family suffer hardship or poverty, rather, we are ensuring that our social welfare system takes care of those in need while encour<Col N="655"/>aging people to improve their skill set with a view to securing employment at all times.  This is where the focus must and should lie.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of jobseekers allowance, reductions were announced in last December&rsquo;s budget for younger members of society.  External factors were considered before introducing this measure, such as the comparisons drawn between the rates available here and in other jurisdictions such as Northern Ireland. This issue is very close to my own constituency in Donegal.</P>
        
        <P>Becoming unemployed can have a negative impact on young people&rsquo;s general outlook on life and it is vital that they are encouraged to stay in the labour market.  Idleness among young people is hazardous and for this reason it is credible to increase the financial incentive for participating in education and training.  Young people have an enormous ability to learn new skills.  This must be encouraged because the labour market demands flexibility and one can never learn enough.  Evidence that the reduced rates of social welfare have incentivised young people to participate in education and training vindicates the measures introduced.</P>
        <P>The social welfare payments of people in receipt of jobseekers&rsquo; payments who refuse to participate in activation measures such as education and training will be subject to various financial penalties, with the exception of those who have a plausible reason for not participating.  These measures will work in tandem with the integration of F&Aacute;S functions into the Department of Social Protection and will actively discourage unnecessary long-term dependence upon unemployment payments.  Currently, a full disallowance may be imposed if a recipient is not genuinely seeking work and the Bill strengthens that provision by imposing a full disallowance where a recipient has refused an offer of suitable employment.  Only primary payments are affected and rates for child and adult dependants, where applicable, will remain unchanged if a claimant is subject to a penalty rate.  Furthermore, these reduced rates will only apply where the primary social welfare payment relates to jobseeking activities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Significant changes to the one-parent family payment are also provided for in this Bill.  Considerable thought was given to this issue and it is believed that the availability of the one-parent family payment until a child is 18, or 22 if in full-time education, without a requirement on the recipient to engage in employment or education and training is not in the best interest of anybody involved or, indeed, of society.  The focus should be on encouraging people into employment or education and training at every available opportunity.  Unfortunately, the child of a lone parent is four times more likely to be in consistent poverty than the overall population, in spite of improvements to the one-parent family supports available over the years.  The current payment also encourages long-term dependence on social welfare for many people who are otherwise capable of participating in employment or education and training.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With this in mind, it is sensible to encourage lone parents to participate in education or training in the event that employment will be available.  These new measures aim to improve the economic situation and social well-being of the recipients and their families.  This measure has been criticised from across the floor but let us compare our one-parent family payments with what is available in other jurisdictions.  The Minister is proposing that from 2011 all new customers will receive the one-parent family payment until their youngest children reach 13 years of age.  Existing customers will enjoy a six year phasing out period to enable them to access education and training with a view to securing employment.  In the UK, lone parents are required to seek work when their youngest children reach ten years of age and this limit will be reduced to seven years later this year.  Norway, Sweden, Germany and Italy impose a work obligation when the youngest child is three years of age.  It is generally believed internationally that the provision of long-term lone parent payments prevents the reduction of child poverty.  The countries that are achieving the best outcomes in terms of reducing child poverty are those which combine strategies aimed at facilitating access to employment and enabling services with <Col N="656"/>income support.  That is the direction we must take and it is vital that we do not regard this as a measure to force lone parents out to work when their children are still young.  This measure will increase income, self-belief and financial independence for many families.</P>
        <P>If a lone parent is still in need of income support when his or her child reaches 13 years of age, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or other appropriate income supports payment may be made available or, if the individual is in employment, he or she may qualify for a family income supplement.  Child care provision may also be an issue for many lone parents.</P>
        <P>This Bill is thorough, fair and forward thinking.  We are undergoing changing times and it is vital that we adapt our social welfare provisions accordingly.  I note the Minister&rsquo;s intention to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  Among these is the sensible proposal to transfer the rural social scheme and the community services programme to the Department.  This measure will provides the Minister with the necessary powers in respect of the employment services and community services programme of F&Aacute;S and, subsequently, to transfer the related funding in order to focus more effectively on labour activation measures.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Ring and welcome him to the Chamber given the day that is in it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman.  Important business awaits me across the road but I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, on his appointment.  I have known the Minister for many years and, particularly in his last role as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, he introduced a number of initiatives with the intention of improving the quality of life for people in rural Ireland, encouraging people to return to the workplace and ensuring rural people have the same access to services as their urban counterparts.  I welcome the transfer of the rural social scheme to the Department of Social Protection and I hope the Minister will bring his common sense with him to his new role.</P>
        <P>I will address the good parts first and be critical later.  The rural social scheme was one of the best measures ever introduced because it gave people opportunities on two levels.  People who were unemployed for years or never had an opportunity to join the workforce were enabled to participate while benefiting their communities.  It did not undermine the work programmes of the OPW or local authorities and a great number of projects would never have been completed but for the rural social scheme.  Taxpayers are getting great value for the money they invest in the scheme and, in light of the number of unemployed people in this country, I encourage the Minister to seek further funding in order to expand it.  Community employment schemes have also been transferred to the Department.</P>
        <P>In these extraordinary and difficult times, I urge the Minister and his officials to explore ways of allowing people to rejoin the workforce, whether through community employment, the back-to-education scheme or the rural social scheme.  Rules and regulations should not hold people back.  Several of my constituents will not qualify for the back-to-education scheme until next October or December but they want to start college in September.  They do not qualify because they have not been unemployed for sufficient time but they are being debarred for another year.  I recognise it is not easy to change the rules halfway through the lifetime of a scheme but we are in extraordinary times and discretion should be applied.</P>
        <P>I recently wrote to the Department regarding a girl who applied for two jobs, one of which was on a community employment scheme.  She had a Garda clearance certificate and all the necessary qualifications but because of the notional value of the property she owned, she was <Col N="657"/>unable to qualify for a social welfare payment.  She will qualify for social welfare shortly if her circumstances do not change because she is unable to sell her property and the State will have to support her.  If she cannot get assistance from the Department of Social Protection, she will have to seek the help of the community welfare officer.  Would it not be preferable to investigate ways of allowing this person, who is depending on her savings to survive, into a community employment scheme rather than force her into a social welfare trap further down the road?  If she had qualified for the scheme, she may have done valuable work in the community over a period of years.  An employer will often offer employment to people who find themselves in such circumstances.  Will the Minister examine this matter because there is nothing worse for families?</P>
        <P>I know the family in question well.  Both parents work and the couple have children at college.  Their business collapsed as a result of the economic climate and they did not expect that they would have to apply for social welfare.  The Minister and Acting Chairman, Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor, as practising politicians, will have experience of similar cases.  A large number of those who visit our clinics have never been in a politician&rsquo;s office or social welfare office and do not know their rights and to what benefits they are entitled.  They never sought benefits but now need to draw them down because they do not have a job and are under tremendous pressure.  I ask the Minister to facilitate such people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raise the issue of those who believe community welfare officers have made the wrong decision in their case.  I ask the Minister and his officials to address the appeals mechanism.  It is wrong to deprive people of benefits and have them wait eight or nine months to have their appeals heard.  Will the Minister ensure measures are taken to speed up the appeals process?  I am pleased to note he appears to be indicating that such measures are included in the Bill.  I hope the necessary resources and manpower will be provided to address this issue.  It is wrong that incorrect judgments are made in cases where individuals believe they are entitled to a social welfare payment.</P>
        <P>I am impressed by the number of decisions the social welfare appeals office has overturned in recent years.  I compliment it on adopting an independent view, taking on board all the facts and making the correct decisions in most cases.  I hope the Minister will provide the resources needed to ensure delays in the appeals mechanism are addressed.</P>
        <P>I have discussed the proposal on the rural social scheme and wish to discuss work training.  While I want work training to be effective, there is a small group of individuals who, for one reason or another, are not employable.  I ask the Minister to send out a message to community welfare officers that this group must not be targeted on the ground that they are unable to take up training.  These are lovely, decent people of simple nature, many of whom come to my office, who are unable to work. That is the way life is for them.</P>
        <P>While I have been critical of the manner in which the Department treats some people, it was a highly efficient operation until recently.  I believe matters will improve again now that the industrial relations dispute has been called off.  I am aware that departmental staff are under tremendous pressure, work hard and take a compassionate and reasonable approach.  I compliment them because they treat most people properly.  I hope that will continue in this black economic period.  For this reason, community welfare officers must treat the small group of people who are not employable in a proper manner.  They must not remove &euro;35 or &euro;40 from their social welfare benefits on a pretext.  We do not want more appeals or visits to ourclinics.</P>
        <P>The Minister has made a radical proposal on lone parents, about which I am concerned because I do not want single parents to be targeted.  There is a widespread and incorrect view that lone parents do not work.  Recipients of lone parent benefit are permitted to work a certain <Col N="658"/>number of hours every week and many of them do.  They pay taxes and make a valuable contribution to society and the tax base.  I hope the message goes out loud and clear that it does not pay to be on lone parent benefit but it pays to work.</P>
        <P>We often forget that some one parent households are headed by men who are looking after their children.  Lone parents, particularly women, try to be at home when their children leave for school in the mornings and return from school in the evenings.  They make a major contribution and try hard.</P>
        <P>Something must be done about rent allowance because the current position is untenable.  I have heard it said that rents are falling but that is not always the case.  Landlords must live in the real world.  If they continue to insist that they will not reduce the rents they charge, we must act to ensure they do and, failing that, we must enable tenants to find cheaper accommodation.  In doing so, we must assist tenants rather than pressuring them.</P>
        <P>The Minister must examine the rent allowance scheme on which we spend &euro;600 million every year and about which I have been critical in recent years.  In 75% of cases the allowance is drawn down on a fair basis.  However, a percentage of recipients should not receive it.  The time has come, therefore, to examine the spiralling cost of the scheme because we cannot afford to spend &euro;600 million on it every year.  This money should be spent on the health service, housing and education rather than on paying landlords, some of whom are charging exorbitant rents.  I look forward to having this matter addressed on Committee Stage.  As I am not my party&rsquo;s spokesperson, it may be one of my colleagues who takes Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The Department has not done a bad job on fraud in recent years.  More and more people are becoming angry about people working while drawing social welfare payments.  They are no longer afraid to complain to the Department which has dealt well with such complaints in recent years.  Those who defraud the Department must be dealt with, particularly given the times in which we live and the scarce resources available.  The resources necessary must be provided to those dealing with fraud because it takes money from all our pockets.</P>
        <P>We have a lost generation of young people who have been out of work for the past two or three years.  Some of them are in their 20s and if the current position continues, they will find themselves unemployable.  The National Youth Council of Ireland has called on the Minister to be sympathetic to the plight of young jobless people.  The individuals affected are unemployed through no fault of their own and need help and support.  We must ensure young people do not feel deprived and depressed because we know what follows.  We must encourage, assist and support them and make them feel wanted.  For this reason, I ask the Minister to produce proposals to help young people find job placements and give them some hope and confidence.  It is in all our interests to keep young people in the country and offer them hope.  We cannot allow them to believe there is no hope.  The Department must do everything in its power to give young people opportunities through retraining.</P>
        <P>One cannot expect couples in cases where one or both partners has lost employment to keep two or three young adults in pocket money.  Such couples are under extreme pressure as they try to pay mortgages and bills.  We do not want people to be compromised and doing things they do not want to do, in other words, breaking the law.  I am talking about breaking the law or getting involved in things.  We have had that in the past with people joining organisations when there was nothing else to do.  We do not want to go back to the old days.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have a concern over rent allowance that is not easy to address.  The biggest single complaint the Minister, the Acting Chairman and I get is about anti-social behaviour in rented accommodation.  Some penalty needs to be put in place.  We need to deal with people who are getting rent allowance and are disturbing their next door neighbours who have bought their houses <Col N="659"/>and are paying their mortgages.  There are certain powers which are not being used by the State, the Garda or the local authorities.  Whoever pays the piper calls the tune.  If we are paying rent allowance to these people, there needs to be some accountability on community welfare officers.  They cannot be allowed to hand out rent allowance to criminals and allow them to have parties and to make life a misery for other people.  Somebody needs to support and help them.  Given the amount of rented accommodation we have, people are frustrated and feel they have no support or backup and that there is nobody there for them.  I feel a bit that way, myself, at the moment.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will not want to miss the decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be a while yet before the decision so I will be all right for that.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will be compassionate.  These are difficult times for people.  I do not want to see the weak and poor further disadvantaged.  The social welfare budget is approximately &euro;20 billion.  We have given &euro;22 billion to the banks.  While I accept there needed to be a cut in every Department, it is the Minister&rsquo;s duty and mine to ensure we protect the weak, the sick and others who are in need at this time.  We need to give them the resources to ensure they have some quality of life and are able at least to fend for themselves and their families.</P>
        <P>It is very difficult for single people.  They are not working and are around all day.  There is a cost factor to that in itself.  I hope the Minister will come up with new schemes to retrain people and to keep as many of them as possible on these schemes.</P>
        <P>I cannot say anything more.  I look forward to Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Deputies who have made significant contributions and in the main have been very constructive in their contributions.  Since Deputy Ring is here and he could be in other places, I would like to address some of the very valid issues he has raised.  I have spent a lifetime trying to create employment and a better life for ordinary people in an area the Deputy knows very well because it borders his constituency.  I have become convinced that people have a need to work.  Work is not just about earning money, but is something to which people aspire.  The need to work seems to be inbuilt in us.  The greatest challenge we face is the creation of job opportunities for our people.</P>
        <P>In my experience the majority of people who are unemployed at present are more than willing and able to go to work and they want to work.  If it is offered they will take it.  As the Deputy mentioned, I was involved in the rural social scheme.  Responsibility for the rural social scheme with 2,600 people, the community services scheme with 2,700 people, the community employment scheme with 25,000 people and the jobs initiative with something less than 2,000 on it is transferring into the Department of Social Protection.  We are basically counterpointing the &euro;4.2 billion, which we pay to people on condition that they are available for work but are not working, against the money we spend on activation.  There is no point in talking about <Col N="660"/>doing that if we do not consider the third issue we need to address, an issue the Deputy touched upon, which is the small number of people &mdash; all Deputies complain about this &mdash; who are working and drawing social welfare at the same time.  They are in unfair competition with people who are working legitimately and paying their taxes.  The State must have the ability to question and disqualify people who are not available for work if that is not genuinely the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody is arguing with the Minister on that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am delighted to hear that.  Issues were raised about reasonable offers.  That is an issue we can discuss at length on Committee Stage.  In order to make the activation part possible I need the ability to weed out those who are not entitled to social welfare.  I have great sympathy for the point made by Deputy Ring that there are people who I would define as being unemployable.  There is also a category who people often overlook who are employable in the long term on social schemes but who will never &mdash; regardless of the amount of training they are offered &mdash; get jobs in commercial enterprises.  When we designed the rural social scheme we purposely did not put a finite number of years on the scheme.  As well as training schemes, we need work schemes for those who are unlikely ever to get commercial employment.  My objective is to try to ensure that as many people as possible, who are now on the live register and are very anxious to go to work, will get that opportunity.</P>
        <P>An issue was raised about young people.  I have met parents of young people who have not allowed them to sign on to unemployment assistance because they did not want to get them into the habit of getting money every week and doing nothing for the money.  They are very anxious that those same young people would be given the opportunity to start somewhere with work.  I have great sympathy for those people.  I sometimes find it difficult to ask them to sign on and start to draw so that we can get them into the various schemes.  Many parents are mortally afraid that once a person gets the taste of the cheque every week, it might become an easy way out.  I do not believe many of our young people would succumb to that, but it is a fear that has been expressed to me by parents.  I know parents who discourage their young people from signing on to get their entitlements as a result.</P>
        <P>We should take the Bill as a totality including my proposed Committee Stage amendments to transfer the schemes to the Department of Social Protection.  The purpose of the scheme is to activate people, to weed out those who should be and are not entitled to or for some unspecified reason are not available for work, and to use the savings to activate people and to give places to people who are anxious to work.</P>
        <P>I wish to touch on social welfare appeals.  I accept it is necessary to speed up the appeals process.  We used to have 5,000 appeals outstanding at the end of any year which has now risen dramatically and we are expected to get as many as 30,000 appeals this year.  We need to deal with those.  At the end of last year we had 16,000 appeals on hand.  Everybody knows that if 30,000 and 16,000 are in hand, some 46,000 appeals would have to be dealt with in the year.</P>
        <P>In 2009 18,000 appeals were dealt with, so if we continued last year&rsquo;s rate we would wind up with 28,000 appeals left at the end of the year.  We have taken a number of initiatives and the moment I arrived at the Department I sought to address the issue.  In fairness to my predecessor and those in the Department, they were already working on it.  We have assigned two additional appeals officers and there has been an increase in productivity and better work methods.</P>
        <P>We have looked at how the work is being streamlined; in a simple appeal where somebody has an issue with the number of contributions, which is a black and white issue, there can be streamlining.  More complicated appeals involving means testing and so on can be in a different <Col N="661"/>stream so we can make more decisions on a summary basis, improving the process.  There is also significant investment in IT enhancement.</P>
        <P>These measures have already had an effect.  By the end of April the number of appeals in hand had gone to 20,000 and two and a half months later it has stabilised at that figure and there has been no increase.  We intend to appoint for two days a week eight retired appeals officers, which will give us three full-time equivalents.  As they are experienced these people can get to work immediately.  It is a stop-gap effort and we hope to get back to 16,000 appeals on hand by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>We must go much further to ensure that people do not feel the necessity to appeal the decisions and that where there are appeals, they would be finalised in very good time.  During my time as Minister I will work hard to ensure that the resources and systems exist to reduce waiting times for appeals.  There is a provision in the Bill to deal with that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister get retired people to do this or will he train unemployed people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>In the short term we will employ retired appeals officers because an extraordinary knowledge of social welfare and other laws is required.  It would take too long to train people to work this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>So those people will get their pension and this payment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, in the short term.  It is the lesser of two evils.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department should train people as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We have already appointed two extra appeals officers.  I will work towards a position where in the normal way appeals officers will be promoted from within the system, and we have a sufficient number of trained appeals officers to deal with the backlog.  There is much work to be done on the way the appeals system operates as some are more complicated than others.  There must be a fast-track system for the black and white appeals, allowing us to go through to the oral hearings for more complicated examples.</P>
        <P>I will work on the issue and we can discuss it in further detail on Committee Stage.  We must try to ensure that within Department resources of full-time public servants, we can keep the number of appeals at an acceptable level and deal with appeals expeditiously.  In the context of where we are with the phenomenal growth in the number of appeals, it would take too long to train people and have people waiting in the meantime.  People are entitled to a certain service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister concerned about the number of appeals which are successful?  It is a problem when the wrong decisions were made the first time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  The number of decisions appealed in the first place is approximately 2%, so 98% of decisions are accepted.  However, the figure for successful or partially successful appeals at 40% is high on the face of it.  We must examine the issue.  I have often written appeals for constituents and gone to appeals hearings with them, although this changed when I became a Minister.  I got more information from the client in the appeal than what was in the final information available to the deciding officer in the first place; the appeal might not have been necessary if such information was always available.</P><Col N="662"/>
        <P>This seems to happen with medical certification in particular.  If people are refused a benefit on medical grounds they are told to go to a consultant for a long explanation of the medical condition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That should be considered in the Department and by its medical officers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a definite problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I have discussed it at length with the chief medical officers and there is a system in place.  There may be a way to get the information from medical practitioners as most of the medical examinations are done from desks; the assessor does not see the person and only information is provided.  Methods are being developed to bring in more information, which would make it easier to make a decision based on available medical evidence.</P>
        <P>I do not know if Deputies have found the following to be a problem.  Often people confuse the statement of the medical condition with the issue that the law requires.  For example, this applies in the question of whether a person is capable of working.  Stating that a person has a certain medical condition does not necessarily equate to them being incapable of work, as there are issues such as education and the type of work and so on.  We must consider this system and improve it until the system is streamlined and we reduce, as far as possible, the need to appeal.  Any appeals should be based on giving more information the second time around than the first.</P>
        <P>In some cases people can be reticent about means and they must be encouraged to get bits of paper together.  In rural areas there is an issue with farmers getting receipts together and so on.  Quite a bit of work can be done in this regard and we will work on such issues.</P>
        <P>Deputy Enright raised the issue of the carbon tax and a group is set to make recommendations over the summer.  There appears to be some misunderstanding, although I accept the original speech could be read ambiguously.  It was always the intention for the issue to take in the winter period and that is still very much on the cards.</P>
        <P>An issue was raised about the certificate of death abroad.  I recently met a delegation of people with regard to the issue in consultation with the chief registrar.  There are a number of technical complications and other issues arising but we agreed a timescale.  It is a long process and provisions cannot be made in this or the next Bill.  It is planned to bring in a civil registration Bill at some time and Deputies can rest assured that the issue has not been parked.  A process has been agreed with families on how we will consider the matter and it was a positive meeting.  I was happy that there was good engagement and we agreed how to work on the issue.  I understand the difficulties but there are also challenges from a legal perspective.</P>
        <P>Deputy Costello raised an issue concerning section 23 and I confirm my intention not to proceed with the section.  It involves the publication of names.  The people would be brought into open court anyway and reporters can attend such courts; we have seen reporting of cases of serious fraud of the social welfare system.  It is my intention to propose that the provision be deleted.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shortall raised several interesting issues, although some were more related to tax.  I heard the Deputy&rsquo;s comments.  There are proposals to change the taxation of pensions, for example, but she raised other issues such as tax relief in pensions, employers and the overall tax pot.  I would not know people in that tax position.</P>

	<P>I know but the allegation is often made that we know these people.  I certainly do not know them.  I accept what the Deputy says and, like every aspect of fiscal policy, the issues in question are all worthy of consideration.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also referred to reimbursements being made to the Department by insurance companies in the context of social welfare payments deducted from awards of special damages in respect of loss of earnings.  In 2002, the Law Reform Commission recommended the introduction of a system modelled on that which obtains in the UK.  I am extremely interested in giving consideration to this matter because any source of money would be welcome.  However, quite a number of issues would have to be addressed before such a system could be introduced.</P>
        <P>I was somewhat disappointed when I researched the position with regard to the UK&rsquo;s compensation recovery unit.  The UK operates a slightly different tax year to Ireland but in the 2007-08 and 2008-09 tax years the unit raised between &pound;138 million and &pound;142 million.  Given that the population is approximately ten times the size of Ireland&rsquo;s, it would appear that if we established such a unit we could take in &euro;14 million.  At one stage it was suggested that up to &euro;88 million could be raised here.  In light of the major amount of work that would be involved, I would be much more interested in taking in &euro;88 million rather than &euro;14 million.  I will certainly be giving consideration to this matter.  However, it does not appear to be quite as good a source of revenue as one might have envisaged.</P>

        <P>The position in respect of the one parent family payment is that we have put forward a proposal.  I accept that any such proposed change will not work unless support services are provided.  I return again to the circle I wish to create.  There will be a need for after-school services in order to achieve the proper results.  There will also be a need to encourage young people, regardless of whether they are from one or two-parent families, to become involved in many more activities and to provide them with a greater level of support than that which obtains at present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I reiterate what I said earlier with regard to activation.  We must avail of the services of those whom we currently pay to do nothing but who wish to do something.  We should enable these individuals to work by encouraging them to become involved in providing the required services.  There is an opportunity for parents, including those who are parenting alone, to provide the services to which I refer.  People, particularly those who live in urban disadvantaged areas, like much more comprehensive services to be provided in respect of young people in order that they will not be encouraged around the streets but that they might become involved in art, music, sport and many other activities.  The way to do this is by providing after-school support.</P>
        <P>When I was involved with the RAPID programme, I came to the conclusion that the cycle of disadvantage that affects urban RAPID areas is often related to fact that the extracurricular activities enjoyed &mdash; and almost accepted as a right &mdash; by children brought up in more affluent areas are not available to their counterparts in the areas to which I refer.  I have always believed that the lives of young people can be affected in an extremely positive way by their involvement in extracurricular activities.</P>
        <P>I will be willing to discuss these various issues on Committee Stage.  I reiterate that the changes to which reference has been made have been long discussed and that they relate to considering ways to obtain the best outcomes for diverse groups of people.  There is a need to engage in a mature discussion on these issues rather than trading insults in respect of them.</P>

I listened carefully to many of the points raised in respect of it during this debate.  As already stated, the proposal is part of a much wider package.  I fully accept that if we are going to take this route, what we are doing will not work if we do not provide the necessary support services.</P>
        <P>There is one aspect of this matter to which reference was not made.  As a number of Members indicated, many single parents are in full-time employment.  I accept that these people face a struggle each day.</P>

The process will begin in three or four of the larger branch offices to identify if there are training or other issues that need to be addressed before this is rolled out to all branch offices.  The branch offices will deal with four categories of claims, including JB claims with full contribution histories, unlimited payments between 65 and 66 years of age, credit cases, second and subsequent children where entitlement to full or half rate increased where qualified childhood has already been established.</P>

The refunds will apply in respect of contributions made over a four year period.  On incapacity supplement, there are 114 recipients of incapacity supplement aged 66 years or over.  Of those 114 people, 20 are qualifying adults aged 66 years or over.  Many Members raised issues in regard to the one parent payment and so on.  In an ideal world, were we not where we are, we would have one working age payment.  This matter is being considered in the Department.  There are many challenges in terms of moving from the current system to that type of system.  The challenge is to ensure we do not go backwards.  I am interested in this concept.  I have long criticised the means testing system in the Department.  Now that I am Minister for Social Protection I will be actively examining how we can achieve the type of social welfare system I would have always liked us to have.  There is a huge amount of work to be done on issues such as how we count days in respect of casual work and so on.

        <P Just="Left">The issue of data matching was raised.  Data exchange with the Irish Prison Service commenced in December 2004 and in this respect data are exchanged on a quarterly basis.  Data are received in secure format and are matched to relevant live claims.  Where these matches indicate clients that require investigation the cases are referred for control and follow-up.  I dealt yesterday in the House with the issue of electronic certification.  I am often amazed how when people add one plus one they get three.  In this regard I refer to the notion that people will be able to text the Department from anywhere in the world in respect of signing on for unemployment benefit.  I want to clarify this matter.  What I said was that there will be a certification process by mobile phone.  A mobile phone has many uses, two of which are to speak to or text another person.  What is involved in respect of electronic certification is voice telephony and voice recognition.  If the correct person does not ring the Department the voice recognition technology will pick up on this and discontinue the call.  If a person rings from outside the State the computer system will also recognise this and discontinue the call.</P>

I would like if forms and information systems were dealt with in this way given the frustrations in this regard of which I am sure Members have had experience.  What I find frustrating is when a person applies for OAP and is asked for all his or her employment records.  One would imagine all of this information to be available in the Department.  I have discussed these issues and would like to see much more user-friendly technology being used in this regard.  I believe also that it should be rolled out as fast as possible.  However, we must in rolling it out ensure that existing technology continues to work until the new system is in place.

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>No. It is expected to be ready for initial trial implementation towards the end of this year.  The project has gone way beyond that suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not hold his breath.</P>

	<P>What if a person is at work while making the phone call?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an issue.  I have heard many stories in relation to the existing system of people taking time off work to sign on for benefit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>This brings me back to the other equation in regard to the need to ensure people are genuinely available for work.  I am examining this in the context of activation.  I fully accept what the Deputy is saying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the estimated cost?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The majority of people claiming social welfare payments are not working.  I presume the Deputy accepts that.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It will free up front-line staff, who deal with thousands of people simply signing on, to look at high risk customers and see if they are working.  We will have human resources to track down high risk customers.  </P>
        <P>I believe strongly in activation, by offering people positions in schemes and then tracking those people who suddenly become unavailable.  Every time we engage in the national employment action programme we find that people disappear very fast when they are asked to come for an interview.  We need to put more resources into front-line staff to check on what those people are at and why they disappear when they are asked for an interview.  It is a matter of putting a whole package together.</P>
        <P>It does not make sense to tie up a huge number of officials dealing with the honest, ordinary people in a bureaucratic process.  We should focus their efforts where there is a risk.  It all comes back to risk analysis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister an estimated cost for this new technology?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I can get it for the Deputy.  Any reasonable technology expense is worthwhile if it gives better outcomes.  When I ran community businesses I often said human beings, if not used productively, have a much higher cost than equipment.  In any process, if something is repeated <i>ad nauseam </i> to hundreds of thousands of people it makes sense to invest in the technology to automate the process and use resources to better effect, as Deputy Enright <Col N="669"/>has suggested, in looking at high risk people and ensuring they are not working and drawing at the same time.</P>
        <P>Deputies Mary O&rsquo;Rourke and Ulick Burke raised the issue of the back to education allowance and the higher education maintenance grants.  Those in receipt of the one-parent family payment are entitled to the higher education grant and will continue to be so.  They are not, however, entitled to rent supplement.  On the other hand, those in receipt of the back to education allowance will not, under the new regime, be entitled to two maintenance payments.  They will be entitled to rent supplement.</P>
        <P>An issue has arisen as to why people in receipt of the one-parent family payment cannot get rent supplement.  That warrants examination.  Some people who are in receipt of the back to education allowance are using their higher education grant to pay for child care and travel expenses.  I discussed this issue with the Minister for Education and Skills and I met the Union of Students in Ireland.  I am looking at the issue to see if there is a way of addressing it.</P>
        <P>The issue of mortgage interest supplement is under review.  It is being looked at in the context of personal debt.  A committee, under Mr. Hugh Cooney, is looking at this whole question.  I see the mortgage interest supplement issue being addressed in that context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That report is 15 months overdue.  When does the Minister expect to have it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cooney committee is to report by the end of this month.  It is in that context that I see this review being brought to finality.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What happens in the meantime?  Huge numbers of people are being refused.  People are losing their homes because of this delay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The evidence does not bear that out.  I accept that there is a serious issue.  I am anxious that these issues be brought to a finality.  The committee will issue a report and it will be brought to Government.</P>
        <P>The very valid issue of rent subsidy was also raised.  We are paying &euro;500 million on rent subsidy.  Local authorities must be more proactive with the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and put people into longer term tenancies than is possible under the rent supplement scheme, which was never meant to be a long-term solution to people&rsquo;s housing needs.  I recently met Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Threshold and the Simon Communities and I have offered to meet those groups again before the end of July.  I intend meeting them on a regular basis to examine the whole issue of rent supplement.</P>
        <P>We have no direct relationship with tenants, but the properties being rented must be of an adequate standard.  This is something I would like to do some work on.  It is warranted because the State has a major investment in the rent supplement scheme. I am very anxious to ensure that every landlord would provide a PPS number.  Much work is being done on data matching.  I understand the vast majority of landlords who have had their tax affairs checked were found to be compliant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Those figures are not available. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I have figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The last figures showed that 20% of landlords had provided PPS numbers.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="670"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct in that.  However, we provide all the names and addresses of landlords and they are data matched by the Revenue Commissioners.  Revenue has done a sample survey to see how many landlords are compliant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister make those figures available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I understand we can get those figures for the Deputy, and it is a very high number.  If a person receives a grant of &euro;10,000 and uses it to pay for a service, the person who provides the service, and gets a payment of &euro;10,000 or more, should produce a tax number.  That seems to me to be fundamental.  The Deputy&rsquo;s figure of 20% is correct and it is not satisfactory.  In achieving 100% compliance, I do not want to put tenants in awkward situations.  I will be working with the groups I mentioned to get us from where we are to where everyone would like us to be, without having tenants lose out.  I will work with the various housing groups to ensure that we get there as speedily as possible.  I will not suddenly take action without considering unintended consequences or discussing it with the groups I have mentioned.  That is the proper way to proceed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many issues were raised during the debate.  I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage when, I hope, we can go through many of the points raised in detail in the structured format of a Committee Stage debate.  I will listen carefully to all suggestions.  Despite belonging to different parties there is much agreement in principle as to where we are going, despite argument about how we go there.  There is much more agreement in principle about where we would like to go and the shape of the society we would like to create than might be apparent from debates in the House.</P>

The sections in question, whose purpose I will outline in the course of my speech, will cease to operate after 30 June next.  An identical resolution was debated in the Upper House today.</P>
        <P>Deputies will recall that the 1998 Act was passed in the wake of the Omagh bombing in August of that year.  That atrocity was condemned by all right-thinking people.  The memory of the innocent lives lost on that summer&rsquo;s day is still vivid 12 years on.  Of course, the impact on the families of those killed and injured in Omagh will never fade.  We must always be mindful of the loss suffered by so many families at the hands of hate-filled fanatics.</P>
        <P>The bombing in Omagh was a clear and calculated attempt by these people to undermine the progress which had been made in the Northern Ireland peace process.  Members of the House will be aware that the peace process was the result of long and difficult negotiations.  It was still, in 1998, very much in its infancy and required careful nurturing and continuing commitment on all sides to ensure its survival.  Those who carried out the bombing sought not only to stymie the peace process but to destroy it.  They sought a return to the bleak sterility of the violence which had characterised so much of the previous quarter-century.  However, their greatest weakness was to underestimate the determination of those who wanted to move on and build a better, peaceful society.  They also underestimated the determination of the Government to counter their activities.</P>
        <P>The response to the bombing showed the resilience of communities of all traditions throughout the island.  It showed that their determination for peace, better co-operation and the rule of law would always triumph over hate and destruction.  It must be remembered also that the Government of the day and the Oireachtas showed that they were equal to the challenge and would not allow the wreckers to achieve their aims.  A strong signal was necessary, and part of that signal was the enactment of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, whose main provisions included changes in the rules of evidence for the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation and the creation of new substantive offences.  These provisions gave the Garda the tools necessary to defeat the bombers of Omagh and those who would follow them.</P>
        <P>The threat these people still pose leaves me convinced that these provisions are still necessary today.  It is a matter of regret that no-one has been convicted for the Omagh bombing.  However, the investigation into this atrocity remains open, and Deputies will share my hope that those responsible may yet be convicted in a criminal court.</P>
        <P>The 1998 Act was passed under clearly exceptional circumstances.  It was natural, therefore, that the Oireachtas should want to reconsider certain provisions periodically and decide whether they are still necessary.</P><Col N="673"/>
        <P>This mechanism affords Deputies an opportunity to consider whether the prevailing circumstances justify the continued need for those provisions.</P>
        <P>Before setting out the reasons I am convinced of the need to retain these sections, I refer Deputies to the report on their use during the past year.  The Act requires me to lay before the Oireachtas a report on the operation of the relevant provisions prior to moving the resolutions for renewal.  The current report covers the period from 1 June 2009, the end date of the previous report, to 31 May this year.  The report was laid before the House on 10 June 2010.</P>
        <P>My assessment, as set out in the report, is that the relevant sections of the 1998 Act should remain in force for a further 12 months.  I have come to this view after taking into account the current security situation, both domestic and international, the advice of the Garda Commissioner and the information contained in the report.  I have also had regard to the reports of the International Monitoring Commission, which clearly articulate the continued threat posed by dissident groups.</P>
        <P>The principal threat to the security of the State continues to be posed by individuals and groups associated with so-called dissident republicanism.  As many in the House have commented, it is a strange kind of republicanism that pursues its aims through the murder of fellow Irish men and women.  For some perverted reason, revealed only to themselves, these groups are determined to destroy the peace that so many have worked so hard to achieve.  They wish to drag all of us back into sterile conflict.  We know what that entails because of our experience over so many years.  The Government is determined they will not succeed.  I have no doubt all Members of the House share that determination.</P>
        <P>We must be realistic about matters and recognise, despite our determination, that the threat posed is severe.  The Independent Monitoring Commission has reported on the increase in activity by these groups, especially the Real IRA, over the past year or so.  No one needs reminding of the horrific attacks in Antrim and Craigavon last year when two soldiers and one PSNI officer were killed.</P>
        <P>The most recent IMC report made a particular point of praising the efforts of the two police forces to counter dissident activities.  This is well-deserved praise that I am certain we all echo.  Their actions have, without question, saved lives and we are grateful to them for that.  Some very significant interventions have been made, such as the recent successful Garda operation in respect of a facility in Dundalk used to manufacture explosive devices.</P>
        <P>North-South co-operation in the area of security is vital and I can give the House the reassurance that it has never been better.  Shortly after his appointment I met the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson, MP, to discuss the security situation.  I have kept in close contact with him and with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, MLA, who I will meet again in the next few weeks.  I know the Garda Commissioner maintains close and frequent contact with Chief Constable Baggott.  This is mirrored by contacts between the two forces at every level.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner has made it clear that as far as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is concerned, an attack on the PSNI is an attack on both forces.  We have never let up on our efforts to counteract the threat from dissidents.  In particular, the resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have always been maintained to deal with that threat and that will be the case as long as that threat exists.</P>
        <P>It is time these thugs stopped opposing the democratic will of the Irish people and gave up their guns.  They have little or no support in their communities.  In fact they are reviled by the vast majority of the people on both sides of the Border.  They need to get that message and cease their hate-filled ideology.  I can assure them that until they do, we will never let up in our pursuit of them, in our efforts to prevent their murderous attacks and in our determination to see them apprehended and put in prison.</P><Col N="674"/>
        <P>While countering the threat posed by dissident groups is very important, it is necessary not to lose sight of the threat from international terrorism.  The 1998 Act grew out of domestic troubles.  However, its provisions form an essential element of the State&rsquo;s response to the threat of terrorism from any source.  We cannot ignore the growth in recent years of the international terrorist threat.  Deputies will be aware of the arrests earlier this year in Cork and Waterford in connection with an alleged international terrorist plot.  In co-operation with our EU partners, we must continue to counteract any threat from such sources.  The 1998 Act forms part of the response to that threat also.  It is the firm view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the Act continues to be a most important tool in its ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism.  The Garda authorities have stated that the provisions of the Act are used regularly.  Furthermore, given the considerable threat posed by some dissident groups it is essential the Act&rsquo;s provisions should continue in force to support the ongoing investigation and disruption of terrorist activity.  The perpetrators of the Omagh bombing and other dissident groups continue to pose a substantial threat.  They still aspire to commit serious acts of terrorism, including murder, and to pursue other criminal aims.</P>
        <P>I refer to the provisions of the 1998 Act that are the subject of the resolution.  I have laid before the House a report on the operation of the relevant sections between the relevant dates.  The report demonstrates the value of the relevant sections to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the necessity for their continued availability in tackling the terrorist threat.</P>
        <P>Section 2 allows a court, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organization, to draw appropriate inferences where an accused person fails to answer or gives false or misleading answers to questions.  However, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on the basis of such an inference.  There must be some other evidence that points towards a person&rsquo;s guilt.  The section was used on 23 occasions in the period covered by the report.</P>
        <P>Section 3 requires an accused, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, to give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his behalf.  This section was used on four occasions.  Section 4 provides that evidence of membership of an unlawful organization can be inferred from certain conduct, including matters such as &ldquo;movements, actions, activities, or associations on the part of the accused&rdquo;.  This section was not used in the period covered by the report.</P>
        <P>Section 6 creates the offence of directing the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act 1939.  This section was not used in the period covered by the report.  Section 7 makes it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.  It was used on 30 occasions.  Section 8 makes it an offence to collect, record or possess information likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences.  It was not used in the period covered by the report.</P>
        <P>Section 9 makes it an offence to withhold certain information that might be of material assistance in preventing the commission of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person for such an offence.  It was used on 117 occasions.  Section 10 extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act from 48 hours to 72 hours but only on the express authorisation of a judge of the District Court following an application by a garda of at least superintendent rank.  Furthermore, the person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his behalf.  The section was used on 25 occasions and an extension was granted in 25 cases.  Section 11 allows a judge of the District Court to <Col N="675"/>permit the re-arrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act but released without charge.  This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can only be authorised where the judge is satisfied on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about that person&rsquo;s suspected participation in the offence.  It was used on 16 occasions.</P>
        <P>Section 12 makes it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  It was not used in the period covered by the report.  Section 14 is, in effect, a procedural section that makes the offences created under sections 6 to 9 and section 12 of the 1998 Act scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act.  This means that persons suspected of committing these offences may be arrested under Section 30 of the 1939 Act.</P>
        <P>Section 17 builds on the provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 providing for the forfeiture of property.  Where a person is convicted of offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act the court is required to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.  The section was not used in the period covered by the report.</P>
        <P>We have made tremendous progress and significant advances in the peace process on this island since the Good Friday Agreement.  It is a matter of genuine regret that provisions such as those contained in the 1998 Act are still required.  So-called dissident groups remain a threat to that progress.  They are opposed to the benefits that have flowed from the peace process and are determined to undermine it.  Let there be no mistake about the Government&rsquo;s equal determination to prevent them achieving their objectives.  The State must retain in its laws the capacity to defeat them.  Effective police action, supported by strong legislation, is essential to counter those aims.  In this regard, I commend the work of the Garda, in co-operation with the PSNI, in facing up to these criminal groups.</P>
        <P>On that basis,  on the information set out in the report and the advice of the Garda authorities, I consider the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act should remain in operation for a further 12 months.  I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are here once again to place the Parliament&rsquo;s annual rubber stamp on the Offences against the State legislation.  We in Fine Gael support the legislation and believe it is a crucial element in the State&rsquo;s ongoing struggle against terrorism on this island.  However, as I may have said before, this annual renewal offers Members, in the D&aacute;il and earlier in the Seanad, a forum to have a serious debate on terrorism, about the degree to which the threat exists and the broad steps being taken to combat new and ongoing threats.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a formulaic aspect to the renewal of these provisions which detracts in many respects from their importance.  It is wrong to treat this annual renewal of provisions as &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo;.  We should be having a more detailed debate on security in which the Minister for Justice and Law Reform would brief a full House on the situation the State now faces.  The various legislative sections we are renewing today are controversial and I would like the Minister to inform us in his reply as to how often these provisions have been used in the past while and whether he believes they still prove effective.  Does he receive from his security briefings any information to suggest there may be deficiencies and, if so, is there any manner by which these deficiencies might be addressed?  For example, the Minister refuses to reveal how many garda&iacute; are dedicated in the area of combating terrorism.  We are told this is for operational reasons.  I can understand why identifying which garda&iacute;  deal with terrorism would be dangerous <Col N="676"/>but refusing to reveal how many are dedicated to this area suggests that as a State we might be less than confident about the numbers dedicated and whether there are sufficient resources to meet that dedication.</P>
        <P>The cutting of Garda overtime by &euro;30 million must be having an impact.  The enormous brain drain in the senior echelons of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which last year saw the loss of 12 chief superintendents, 26 superintendents, 31 inspectors, 166 sergeants and 466 rank and file garda&iacute;, must also be having an impact.  I acknowledge the Minister has authorised and made provision for some appointments but the unprecedented deluge of retirements was created, in part, by the Government&rsquo;s economic policies and, in part, by the failure of the Minister to engage with the garda&iacute; in order that their concerns might be addressed.  The security of the State is not something that can be put at risk by penny pinching.  Reports suggest that the present situation is critical.  The most recent report of the Independent Monitoring Commission, its 23rd to date, warns that the Real IRA is what is described as &ldquo;uninhibited&rdquo; in its use of violence and that it is determined to boost its terrorist capability.  The commission documents murder and attempted murders carried out by the Real IRA during the six month period in which the commission reviewed the situation.  As well as developing improvised weapons, the Real IRA is held responsible for a planned mortar attack on the PSNI station in Keady, County Armagh, and the recent discovery of bomb factory near the Minister, Deputy Ahern&rsquo;s home town of Dundalk is indicative of just how active dissident republicans are in this Republic.  They are thought to be most active in the constituency of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The independent monitoring commission notes that the Real IRA lacks the resources, personnel, money, organisation and cohesion of the Provisional IRA but this does not in any way mean we should be otherwise than gravely concerned.  The Provisional IRA built up personnel, money, organisation and cohesion over many years and unless dissident groups such as the Real and Continuity IRA are stamped out by the State they still have the capacity to grow.  It is already clear their activities extend far beyond what in the past we might have accepted under the umbrella or definition of terrorism.  Like their forebears in the Provisional IRA they remain staunch capitalists, irrespective of whatever left-wing credentials they pretend to have.  The drug trade is obviously a favourite among terrorists, with regular reports that dissident republicans are the main importers and distributors of drugs in the State.  We know how much the State and our capital city in particular have been plagued by the drug activities of the INLA.</P>
        <P>When I made reference to the constituency of the Minister, of course I refer also to the esteemed constituency of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Flanagan forgot about his own constituency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall talk about that too.  Dealing with the link between drugs and terrorists, while the State continues to be half-hearted in its efforts to stem the tide of drugs in this jurisdiction, we are, in effect, playing into the hands of terrorists.  This allows them to thrive, make money, build organisations, gain influence and acolytes.  Our current customs regime is woefully inadequate in the context of the battle against drug smuggling the State currently has on its hands.  We have only two X-Ray container scanners at our ports.  The absence of a scanner at every major sea port means the two existing scanners are moved from port to port.  It is not difficult for criminals to ascertain where the scanner will be and use the information as a basis for choosing their preferred and favoured smuggling route.</P>
        <P>At our airports it is open season for smugglers all year round, a situation to which I have referred before.  The Government&rsquo;s own figures reveal that customs checks at airports for 2009 plummeted compared to the previous year despite an open sore of drug and gangland problems <Col N="677"/>continuing to fester.  Comparing 2009 to previous years, the figures show that customs checks at airports fell by 73% at Waterford Airport, 50% at Weston Airport, 40% at Shannon Airport, 33% at Kerry Airport, 27% at Galway Airport, 21% at Cork Airport, 15% at Donegal Airport&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is because there are fewer aeroplanes flying.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and 11% at the major airport, not half an hour&rsquo;s run from where we stand.  As the Minister will concede, customs checks fell by 500,000 at Dublin Airport compared to the previous year and by a whopping 68,100 at Cork Airport.  The fact is that checks at Weston Airport fell by 50% in the same year that Mr. Justice Anthony Hunt warned about the dangers of private airports being used to smuggle drugs.  The judge spoke on this as he sentenced John Kinsella for conspiring to import heroin worth &euro;7 million and cocaine through Weston Airport in 2007.  It is clear that many smaller and-or private airports received no customs checks whatever.  The Government&rsquo;s belief is that this is too cost inefficient.  This shows a very narrow-minded approach to calculating cost.  What is the cost to the State of the death and destruction wrought on communities by drugs?  What is the cost of facilitating the permanence of terrorists who peddle drugs across this State, whose principal role and function is to undermine the democratic institutions of this State?  </P>
        <P>The narrow view of the Government is reflected in the customs presence around our coastline.  The Minister knows that at present we have only two patrol boats to patrol 4,300 km of coastline.  Accordingly, the Navy plays a key role in supplementing an under-resourced customs service.  Therefore, the recent decision of the Government to slash naval patrols by 200 days is another boost to the drug smugglers.</P>
    
        <P>The bottom line is that defeating terrorists in this State is not solely about finding bomb factories.  It also involves examining how terrorist activity is funded and ensuring that terrorist organisations are not given a free run in importing drugs and empire-building.</P>
        <P>I was very surprised this morning to hear Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in demand that the Offences Against the State Acts be removed from the Statute Book.  I wonder if the Deputy has read the report of the Independent Monitoring Commission and its conclusion that &ldquo;the range and nature of RIRA&rsquo;s activities in the six months were, by any yardstick, a very serious matter&rdquo;, that &ldquo;its threat was dangerously lethal&rdquo; and that the Continuity IRA remained &ldquo;a major threat&rdquo;.  Of course, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s party also wants the Independent Monitoring Commission to be wound down.  How is this justifiable, given the amount of terrorist activity in recent months?  In an ideal world, we would not have need for strong anti-terrorist legislation, but we do not live in an ideal world.  We cannot turn a blind eye while bomb factories in the Republic are set up to murder citizens in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s stance on the Offences Against the State Acts and the continuance of the Independent Monitoring Commission may be put in context by recent reports that the defunct IRA, along with members of Sinn F&eacute;in, were responsible for an enormous counterfeiting operation recently uncovered in my home county of Laois.  Europol described the operation as one of the biggest and most sophisticated counterfeiting operations ever uncovered in Europe.  When garda&iacute; raided a bunker a couple of weeks ago in a quiet and peaceful part of rural Laois, they found enough ink and specialist paper to produce &euro;200 million worth of &euro;50 and &euro;100 notes.  It is thought that the counterfeiting factory produced tens of millions of euro for the republican movement before the Garda raid, and the notes have spread right across Europe.  Reports suggest the counterfeiting operation was established to counteract the IRA&rsquo;s losses when Lehman Brothers collapsed.  The grotesque greed and unbridled capitalist appetite of many in the <Col N="678"/>republican movement makes a farce of the pious posturing of Sinn F&eacute;in.  I congratulate the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Europol for their successes in bringing the counterfeiting operation to an end.</P>
        <P>We cannot preserve the fragile peace for which we have long campaigned if the Government is complacent.  Eternal vigilance in this House is the price of peace on this island.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister for Justice and Law Reform of the day solemnly tells D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that it is necessary for the House to continue in force the relevant sections of the 1998 Act for a further period of 12 months, then the Labour Party is not minded to dispute that assessment.  I say that with a somewhat heavy heart because in a peace-time democracy there are issues of human rights and of compliance with our international commitments that arise.  However, if the intelligence available to the Minister concludes that there is an ongoing significant threat posed by so-called dissident groups, then I accept that it is our duty to take all necessary steps to protect human life and the security of the State.</P>
        <P>We are provided only with the flimsiest of justification for this and only then at the last minute.  I do not know if it is necessary for the Minister to interpret the legislation so that we do not get this report until the day of the debate itself.  I tried to get it last night and I was told that it had not been laid before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It has been in the Oireachtas Library since last Thursday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I stand corrected, but I was told by staff in the library that notice of it was laid before the House, but not the report itself.  I do not want to make a big issue of it.</P>
        <P>The figures show that 880 people were arrested under section 30 and 192 persons were detained for offences contrary to the provisions of the 1998 Act.  There were 35 convictions and a further 127 people are awaiting trial.  These are serious things to be concerned about, and it is my job to take the words of the Minister to the House on matters like this as seriously as they are intended, and as a justification for having to continue the term.  I join with the Minister and Deputy Flanagan in the words of congratulations to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its vigilance.</P>
        <P>Having put a criminal justice Bill through the House that allows for gangs and gang leaders to be arraigned before the Special Criminal Court, I wonder whether we have not reached a stage all these years after the Good Friday Agreement where the gangs to which the Minister refers ought to be treated in the same fashion, and that the political label ought no longer to apply.  Deputy Flanagan sought to extend that argument.  He did not make that point, but he linked the so-called dissident groups to the criminal fraternity and the use of some of the activities that are going on to generate the wherewithal for them to function in this jurisdiction and the neighbouring jurisdiction.  I wonder whether we have reached that stage all these years after Omagh and the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
        <P>There are serious questions that should by now have been addressed about the annual renewal since the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  Instead of going through this lacklustre and <i>pro forma </i>exercise every June, the Government should by now have decided which, if any, of the sections we are asked to renew every year should become part of the permanent law of the State.  I want to take just one example.  Section 9 of the Act makes it an offence to withhold information concerning serious offences.  Specifically, section 9 states that a person is guilty of an offence if he or she has information which he or she knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by any other person of a serious offence, or in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any other person for a <Col N="679"/>serious offence, and fails without reasonable excuse to disclose that information as soon as practicable to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>This is an important section. In particular, it is important to stress that it has application far wider than offences against the State or the sort of offences we might expect to see tried in the Special Criminal Court.  The section makes it a crime to withhold information about the commission of any offence punishable by five years or more in prison that involves the actual or serious risk of loss of human life, serious personal injury, false imprisonment or serious loss of or damage to property.  In the context of the ongoing revelations of systematic child abuse in religious institutions and dioceses, and the systematic cover-up by the authorities of abuse they were aware of, an offence along these lines clearly could have important potential application.</P>
        <P>The least we should expect, by way of lessons learned from the Ryan and Murphy reports, is that our statute book is now up to date and is equipped to take action against and to criminalise a policy &mdash; a conspiracy &mdash; of non-disclosure of physical and sexual abuse that continued in place for decades.   However, section 9 has one serious defect. Presumably because it is part of a package passed in September 1998 as a reaction to the dreadful atrocity at Omagh, the section states that it applies to all forms of serious personal injury except &ldquo;injury that constitutes an offence of a sexual nature&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Probably the most serious, corrosive, systematic and sustained system of <i>omerta </i>to have undermined the integrity of an otherwise law-abiding institution in this State is outside the reach of the law because &mdash; and only because &mdash; it involved withholding information about the commission of sexual offences.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Burton, asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 25 March whether he had any plans for new legislation of general application to deal with withholding information about crime.  The Minister outlined several existing provisions, including section 9 of this Act, one of the sections we are being asked to renew today.  There are existing offences of active interference in a way that impedes the prosecution of crime; accepting  money or other consideration in return for concealing a crime; administering  an oath requiring a person not to give information; and section 9 of the 1998 Act, which I have just outlined.</P>
        <P>Section 176 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 deals with a more specific situation.  It creates an offence of reckless endangerment of a child.  The offence arises where a person is in a position of authority in respect of a child or in respect of an &ldquo;abuser&rdquo;, and where that person knows that a child is at risk of harm or abuse but fails to take reasonable steps to protect the child from that risk.</P>
        <P>My problem is that none of these five provisions deals adequately with the phenomenon of failure by a superior to disclose information about child abuse.  None of them deals adequately with a decision to say nothing and simply to move the abuser elsewhere.  A religious superior who made such a decision could not be accused of taking active steps to impede a prosecution; accepting consideration in return for concealing an offence; so far as we know administering an oath requiring a person not to give information; child endangerment, unless a particular child is exposed to particular risk by the superior&rsquo;s decision; or withholding information under section 9 of the 1998 Act because the offence being concealed is a sexual offence and so that section does not apply.</P>
        <P>However, the Minister told my colleague, &ldquo;Having regard to the statutory provisions already in place, I have no immediate plans for legislation in this area&rdquo;.  There seems to me, on the contrary, to be a compelling argument for extending section 9 to include sexual offences and to extract the section from the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and make it part of the permanent law of the land.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ar dt&uacute;s ba mhaith liom freagra a thabhairt ar an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; ag an Teachta Charles Flanagan tamall &oacute; shin.  I will not allow the accusation of pious posturing by a blueshirt muckraker to go unchallenged in the House.  Since my election, I have stood here and defended human rights time and again.  I wish to state categorically that Deputy Charles Flanagan&rsquo;s assertion of Sinn F&eacute;in links to a counterfeit operation in his constituency is complete rubbish and falls into the same category of much of the rubbish from his favoured source for the justification of renewing these provision we are discussing today.  It is the IMC &mdash; three spooks and a lord &mdash; and includes hearsay, gossip and untruths.</P>
        <P>The Minister is seeking the renewal of the Offences Against the State Act and we need to deal with facts.  My party believes, and when signing the Good Friday agreement the Government and the British Government also believed, that the Offences Against the State Act should be repealed in its entirety.  The powers and provisions that exist in the criminal law are more than sufficient to deal with the crimes and activities of organisations the length and breadth of the State.  Once again I implore all Deputies to consider the highly detrimental effects of this legislation on human rights, democratic life and the safety and well-being of citizens in this State before the vote on the motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party, Fine Gael and the Labour Party all need to start respecting international law.  The UN fundamental human rights instruments to which this State has signed up make it very clear that fundamental rights protections may be derogated from only in times of emergency.  I will repeat what I stated when this motion was debated year in and year out since 2002, namely that I do not believe that an emergency exists in this State that warrants these draconian measures.  While Sinn F&eacute;in has been alone in the House in recent years in rightly opposing the Act, this was not always the case.  We had been joined by others in our opposition.  We had been joined by the Green Party until it threw in its lot and all of its principles to prop-up the Government.  We were also joined in our opposition to the Act by the late Tony Gregory, who truly valued the concepts of democracy and human rights.</P>
        <P>Whether we stand alone here today or not we are not alone internationally because the UN Human Rights Committee agrees with us and has called year in year out for an end to the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court.  It is not only our international commitments that necessitate opposition to the motion before us today but also the Government&rsquo;s obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  The Agreement places an onus on the Government to deliver security normalisation.  Hence, the scrapping of the Offences Against the State Acts is a pressing goalpost for all in this House.  The provisions up for renewal, and the Offences Against the State Acts in their entirety,  have no place in the present or future of the island.</P>
        <P>I will state again, as I have in the past, that the illegal activities of groups in the State which are opposed to the Good Friday agreement must be stamped out.  The most effective way to do so is to live up the commitments of the Good Friday Agreement and ensure progress towards the reunification of Ireland, and proving that democracy can and does work.</P>
        <P>This year again, the report was laid before the House at a very late stage and Deputy Rabbitte mentioned this.  To my knowledge, it was done late last week.  I do not understand why the report is not circulated to all Deputies when it is laid before the House.  The Minister intends us to suspend normal rights and each year reintroduce draconian measures.  At a minimum every Deputy and Senator should have a copy of the report sent to him or her so he or she has some understanding of what they are being asked to vote on.  Year in year out it is the same Deputies who contribute to the debate and most of the backbenchers in all the parties, bar my own, would not have a clue what was contained in the report, and have probably never accessed it.</P><Col N="681"/>
        <P>Simply listing in the report the number of occasions on which the various provisions have been used does not allow us an opportunity for informed democratic scrutiny of its operation.  I have stated time and again that the report is grossly insufficient for the purposes of scrutiny.  There is not time available to me to discuss all the various sections and others have mentioned what are their intentions and how they fundamentally breach human rights.</P>
        <P>Sparse as the report is, taken together with each preceding report since the enactment of the provisions in 1999, it demonstrates that sections 4 and 6 were not used in the past year, section 6 has only been used a total of three times since the provisions were brought in, section 12 has not been used since 2001 and section 17 has never been used.  This again brings into question any argument around necessity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the period of 1 June 2009 to 31 May 2010 the number of persons arrested under the Act was 880.  Yet the total number of convictions secured under the Act for the same period was just 35.  There is a huge discrepancy between the annual arrest rates and the annual conviction rates which strongly suggests the possibility that the provisions are being used for trawling purposes or are being abused by garda&iacute; engaged in harassment in circumstances similar to those uncovered in Donegal by the Morris tribunal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the Government really wanted to promote and protect the safety of the public then it would financially and practically resource the Garda, build the forensic laboratory, and resource the DPP and the courts to enforce ordinary criminal justice legislation in a timely fashion.  Instead, the Minister is proposing the lazy and unsafe continuation of emergency legislation today to deal with a problem which can be dealt with through normal procedures.  In fact the Government is actively doing the opposite of what is needed.  The recruitment moratorium has resulted in the reversal of the Garda civilianisation programme which is needed to free up fully trained garda&iacute; from desk duties. It has also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of probation officers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I and my party have consistently called on the Minister to introduce a robust package of realistic and effective measures to tackle serious crime.  Instead the Government has imposed restrictions on Garda overtime and a ban on recruitment and promotions.  The force is to remain dependent on outdated and inadequate equipment.  Instead of addressing the real reasons that gangland criminals seem to enjoy impunity for their crimes and introducing and resourcing practical and sustainable measures to protect individuals, families and whole communities from intimidation, this Government lazily slashes fundamental justice rights like those suspended by the Offences against the State Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I and my party last year produced a document, policing with the community, which set out a number of measures which are urgently required to tackle serious crime.  I will mention a few.  They include an expedited and far-reaching process of civilianisation, which is on hold; the increased funding of Garda drugs units with enhanced community input and the independent oversight of informer handling practices to prevent situations developing where individuals with a relationship with garda&iacute; are allowed to amass a criminal empire.</P>
        <P>We also need to ensure there is a properly resourced witness protection programme which can help the Garda and the DPP in trying to deliver convictions.  We need enhanced Garda visibility and activity in areas experiencing chronic drug problems and more sniffer dogs.  I heard the reference to X-ray machines.  I have called for a number of them at ports around the country.  We also fully recognise that the vast majority of serious crime is drug-related, therefore we have also compiled and submitted to the Government detailed proposals aimed at maximising both demand reduction and supply reduction.</P><Col N="682"/>
        <P>I again urge the house to vote against the renewal motion and demand the Government properly resource the agencies involved in the fight against serious crime because it can be done without this type of emergency legislation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On the procedural issue, the Garda authorities provided a report which brings the issue up to 31 May 2010.  The report was received from the Garda authorities on 10 June and was laid before the House on that day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said the Irish and British Governments are of the view that this type of legislation should not be required.  It is the case that we thought when the Good Friday Agreement was accepted in a vote by the people that paramilitary activity on this island would cease forthwith but unfortunately that has not happened and it has continued.  I accept that some of the information made available in the report is perhaps not as specific as we would like, given the nature of the types of operations that must be kept from the public view but we would like to provide more information.</P>
        <P>I accept that the Deputies who support the motion take on face value to a certain extent what the Minister says on behalf of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the various authorities.  I am aware that Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and his party have a problem with the IMC but equally, the IMC has produced report after report which clearly indicates that activity has emanated from dissident republicans in order to fill their coffers to allow them continue in operation.</P>
        <P>The issue of resources was raised by Deputy Flanagan.  He used the term &ldquo;penny-pinching&rdquo; by the Government.  We have recently debated what went wrong during the Celtic tiger years.  Deputy Flanagen again calls for more resources when his party tried to suggest it was on the road to fiscal rectitude.  To say the Government is penny-pinching is nonsense because the amount of money that goes to the Garda Vote is &euro;1.5 billion, a substantial sum.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The reality is that there has been a huge reduction in the number of flights in and out of this country and I would hazard a guess that is part, if not all, of the reason that there has been a reduction in activity in this area.  The Department of Justice and Law Reform is not directly responsible for this but the Garda work very closely with the Revenue Commissioners and Customs and Excise to make sure that even the small airports and ports are reasonably well monitored.  As I said many times, we are working with our European Union and international counterparts which has been very fruitful.</P>
        <P>In a perfect world, we would not have this type of legislation on our Statute Book but unfortunately we do not operate in a perfect world and we have the remnants of very severe paramilitarism in this country.  We thought we would have rooted them out after the Good Friday Agreement but unfortunately they continue to operate and pose a serious threat to this State.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputies who supported the renewal of these provisions every year.  I understand we dropped section 5 two years ago on the basis that it was not being used.  We will review that situation over the coming months.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  his views on the findings of the report by Professor Honohan that the Irish bank guarantee was cast too wide and took the question of loss-sharing with professional risk investors off the table; his further views on whether he did not obtain a sufficiently broad range of advice in formulating the guarantee; and if he will outline the approach he will adopt in the future. </Quest>
        <QRef>[25944/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In his report on the banking crisis the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, is very clear that an extensive guarantee needed to be put in place.  The Governor raises some questions regarding the scope of the guarantee relating to existing longer-term senior bonds and dated subordinated debt.</P>
        <P>I have on a number of occasions discussed the question of the inclusion of dated subordinated debt in the guarantee and have been clear on the basis the decision was made.  This was, in particular, the requirement to maintain access to wholesale capital markets and guard against the risk of a default for any of these liabilities which could arise from the non-payment of either principal or interest that would have had the effect of triggering the entire guarantee.  It is important to note that none of the guaranteed subordinated debt in Anglo Irish Bank or Irish Nationwide Building Society matured for repayment during the period of the guarantee.</P>
        <P>As far as opportunities for risk-sharing are concerned, I understand that holders of subordinated debt in the three largest banks have suffered losses of more than &euro;5 billion so far.  In addition, credit rating agencies have downgraded subordinated debt in some of the Irish institutions on the basis that they expect further costs to be imposed on these bondholders.  I have consistently made clear there is no question of the guarantee for existing dated subordinated debt being extended beyond 29 September 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Turning to the inclusion of the guarantee provided for existing senior debt on 30 September 2008, it is not straightforward to assess what options were available for burden sharing and how that burden sharing could be achieved in practice.  Moreover, there were significant risks from excluding existing senior bonds from the guarantee, which could have resulted in the guarantee being called on other guaranteed securities with severe consequences for financial stability.</P>
        <P>Apart from these issues, the fact remains that a comprehensive guarantee of bank liabilities was an established part of the standard toolkit for responding to systemic banking crises internationally.  Sweden, which is often regarded as the template for successfully dealing with its banking crisis, provided a blanket guarantee of bank liabilities in the 1990s.  In the current crisis Denmark, another small EU member state, provided an extensive guarantee, including existing <Col N="684"/>bonds early in October 2008.  The Deputy may wish to note that the UK authorities provided a broad guarantee to existing senior bondholders in Northern Rock.</P>
        <P>In overall terms, as is evident from Professor Honohan&rsquo;s report, the guarantee preserved the stability of the entire banking system at a time that it was at serious risk of collapse.  In the circumstances of September-October 2008, with markets characterised in the Governor&rsquo;s report as hysterical, it was essential that the commitment provided by the Government to stand behind the banking system was entirely credible, clear and consistent.  In those circumstances, there were significant risks in an approach which sought to discriminate between different types of bank liabilities which resulted in the financial markets concluding that the guarantee was not market acceptable or indeed credible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Very significant volumes of both short-term and longer-term funding were secured by the banks from wholesale capital markets in the weeks following the introduction of the guarantee.  This has subsequently provided an important foundation to the funding of the banks and a bulwark against funding pressures that have arisen at various times since.</P>
        <P>I am, therefore, satisfied that the Government&rsquo;s decision in this matter was at that time informed by a sufficiently broad range of advice on the formulation of the guarantee.  It will be a priority for me to ensure that it remains the case that Government decision-making on returning our banking system to health is fully informed by expert advice from the Governor of the Central Bank, Financial Regulator and National Treasury Management Agency to which I have delegated significant roles in the restructuring of the banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The report by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, indicates that advisers to the Department from Merrill Lynch explicitly envisaged the exclusion of dated subordinated debt from the coverage of the guarantee.  However, the two main banks requested that subordinated debt be included in the guarantee.  Why, when advisers indicated to the Department that dated subordinated debt should be excluded, did the Department decide to accede to the request by the two main banks?</P>
        <P>Professor Honohan&rsquo;s report states that notes were extremely sketchy at the time the bank guarantee was introduced.  Will the Minister elaborate on the contradiction between the advice given by Merrill Lynch and the advice the Government eventually took?  Will he make the Merrill Lynch report available to the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify, there is not a Merrill Lynch report but a particular note referred to by the Governor of the Central Bank in his report.  As I outlined earlier in the week, I would like to make available the entire file of the Department where the particular advice can be placed in an overall context.  This context will show, in terms of the written record, that the note was but one element of the overall factors which were taken into account on the issue of subordinated debt.</P>
        <P>It is fundamental to emphasise that when the Governor refers to the possible loss on foot of subordinated debt, it is not a loss which has materialised to date because no such subordinated bonds have been paid in Anglo Irish Bank or Irish Nationwide, the two institutions which, in the Governor&rsquo;s report, were failed institutions.  I appreciate that the Fine Gael Party last year took the view that Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks were also failed institutions and wanted their bondholders of various descriptions to participate in some unspecified pain from next September.  Markets have since judged otherwise.  As far as subordinated debt of a dated character in the two institutions in question is concerned, the bonds and the principal in them have not fallen due for payment in the intervening period.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="685"/>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister made the decision to include in the guarantee dated subordinated debt &mdash; lower tier 2 &mdash; why did he go against the advice given in the note to which the Governor of the Central Bank refers in his report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated, the note to which the Deputy refers was given at a particular stage of the discussions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>It was given several days before the guarantee was announced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Oireachtas committee avails of the opportunity, as I am sure it will, to examine the file as a whole and read the various notes on file, it will become clear that the note was but one element of the advice received on the evening in question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>It was an important element of the advice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is of no importance because there has been no liability on foot of it.  Let us be clear about this matter, no dated subordinated bonds have been repaid in Anglo Irish Bank or Irish Nationwide.  I cannot see any reason it is of importance because there has been no actual exposure to the State on foot of these bonds since September 2008.  I have made clear that guarantee cover in respect of these bonds will not take place after September next.  The only question to which the Deputy may like an answer is whether any such bonds will be paid in the intervening period and the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 5 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, since 29 September 2008, the State has guaranteed certain liabilities of credit institutions in Ireland, initially under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme, known as the CIFS scheme, which was on foot of the 2008 legislation, and more recently under the more targeted Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme, known as the ELG scheme.  The ELG scheme allows the participating institutions issue debt liabilities and take deposits under guarantee from the date the institution joins the scheme until 29 September 2010 subject to EU state aid approval.  The duration of the guarantee under the eligible liabilities guarantee corresponds to the term of the relevant guaranteed liability, subject to a maximum term of five years.  In contrast to the credit institutions financial support scheme, the existing liability scheme allows institutions to issue unguaranteed debt and take unguaranteed deposits.</P>
        <P>The existing liability guarantee scheme was approved by the EU Commission under state aid rules from 1 December 2009.  The scheme, in line with all schemes approved under state aid rules, is subject to ongoing six-monthly approval by the European Commission.  The scheme was scheduled for review by the Commission before 1 June 2010 and in order to bring the review date in line with other European guarantee schemes, the Commission has approved the <Col N="686"/>continuation of the scheme under existing terms to 30 June 2010.  This means the formal review of the scheme by the Commission will now be completed before the end of this month.</P>
        <P>Regarding the position after 30 June, discussions with the Commission are progressing and are close to conclusion.  The terms of the prolongation of the ELG scheme being finalised with the Commission would see the scheme being extended under the currently applicable terms and conditions to 29 September 2010 as is provided for in national law.  Beyond this, the guarantee would be modified to provide for a prolongation from end September to 31 December 2010 as an issuance window for liabilities of between three months and five years&rsquo; duration.  In addition the current provisions applicable to retail deposits would continue in their current form to 31 December 2010.  That is an extension of slightly more than three months.</P>
        <P>It is likely that the pricing of the guarantee will also change in line with the pricing structure outlined in the European Commission&rsquo;s staff working document on the application of state aid rules on government guarantee schemes covering bank debt to be issued after 30 June 2010.</P>
        <P>Progress on the phasing out of the guarantee will be achieved consistent with any requirement for continued support of the funding conditions of the banks and the maintenance of financial stability overall.  In my reply I made clear that the discussions and the decision by the Commission will be concluded by the end of this month and I have tried to give the House a sense of the direction of the discussions with the Commission at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister is setting out a proposal to extend the two-year guarantee to 31 December, if he can get the European Union to agree.  If the European Union agrees to an extension of the guarantee to 31 December, will that require further legislation coming before the House or can the Minister do that by order under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act?  Ordinary people understand that the guarantee ends at the end of September, but the Government has already taken two steps, an application to the European Commission to extend the guarantee to the end of December or as long as the Commission is willing to extend it, and to have what is called the eligible liabilities guarantee which allows new debt to be issued for a further five years under a Government guarantee.  In that context can the Minister confirm the figure he gave me approximately two weeks ago that some &euro;74 billion in guaranteed bank liabilities will mature before the end of September, when the original end of September guarantee comes up?  Does the Minister propose to roll over the &euro;74 billion into new debt at that time or does he propose to try to go to the end of the year?  These are very important issues for Ireland because in many ways it will crystallise in the minds of international bond markets the level of the total indebtedness on the part of the Government regarding the guarantee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for her questions which assist in clarifying these matters.  I understand the matter can be dealt with by statutory instrument.  However, that statutory instrument would be required to be brought before the House.  In the event that changes are required to the terms of the current ELG scheme, the draft statutory instrument introducing any changes to the ELG scheme after 29 September 2010 will require Oireachtas approval under section 6 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.  I can, of course, implement any increase in guarantee fees from 1 July on an administrative basis under the current ELG schemes.  However, changes in the terms of the ELG scheme would require approval in both Houses, but not fresh legislation.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also asked about the precise sums and the difficulty of the cliff on 29 September.  I understand that in terms of guaranteed issuance under the CIFS scheme &mdash; the old scheme if one likes as announced in 2008 &mdash; some &euro;29 billion of longer-tem bank debt is due to be <Col N="687"/>refinanced by the end of September 2010.  Obviously a prolongation of the ELG scheme would provide a good basis for the refinancing of these liabilities.  That said, Deputy Burton used a different figure.  I will arrange for my Department to examine&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will arrange to write to the Deputy about that figure.  The information at my disposal this afternoon is that in terms of guaranteed issuance under the CIFS, some &euro;29 billion of longer-term bank debt is due to be refinanced by the end of 2010.  However, I will revert to the Deputy about the wider figure she mentioned,</P>

      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Professor Honohan appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service earlier in the week.  He stated that any renewal or extension of the bank guarantee scheme should only be in respect of new senior debt issued and not in respect of existing senior or subordinated debt or new subordinated debt.  I ask the Minister to outline his views on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I made clear the position on subordinated debt in reply to a previous question.  There is no proposal under discussion with the Commission and there is no intention to provide coverage for any class of subordinated debt after the guarantee period up to 29 September.</P>

	<P>The guarantee in respect of senior debt is due to lapse on 29 September but we are in discussion with the Commission on an extension to the end of the year.  Regarding existing senior debt, the purpose of the ELG scheme is to provide its refinancing on a different basis.</P>

	<P>For how long will existing senior debt be guaranteed under what the Minister now proposes?  Does he envisage it just being guaranteed to the end of December?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>

	<P>What will happen thereafter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Thereafter the ELG scheme will provide, and the ELG scheme already provides, for the possibility of refinancing under guarantee.  Of course the banks are free to finance on an unguaranteed basis also.  Deputies must appreciate the very difficult conditions that obtain in world markets at present in respect of which Ireland is not being singled out to any extent, but is participating as all other European states are participating in a very difficult international context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Contrary to what Fianna F&aacute;il claimed at the time, this guarantee is not the shortest, cheapest no-cost guarantee in the world.  All of our banks remain on life support from the guarantee and continue to require that support.  We were told yesterday that &euro;14 billion of the &euro;22 billion had already gone into Anglo Irish Bank.  Mr. Anysley said that we need to face the fact that it is just gone.</P>
     
        <P>There is nearly &euro;60 billion of senior debt due for renewal on 1 October and there is a total of &euro;141 billion, according to a reply given by the Minister, of wholesale funding.  That is demand deposits, inter-bank lending and the senior debt.  The sub-debt is very small for the reasons outlined by the Minister.</P><Col N="688"/>
        <P>The promises made by the Minister and Fianna F&aacute;il that this would be the cheapest, easiest, cleanest and quickest guarantee in the world is simply not true.  It needs to be extended and &euro;60 billion of debt is needed on 1 October to either be rolled over, extended or included in the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  Along with the Honohan and Regling and Watson reports, that tells us everything.</P>
        <P>When debts are rolled over &mdash; which is good in a way &mdash; the fact is that despite the austerity measures in Ireland, the bond spreads of Ireland compared to Germany and countries like Spain, which are also experiencing difficulties, remain awesomely high.  At least &euro;4 billion in this year&rsquo;s budget will need to be paid to cover the cost of servicing all these different debt requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton is confusing a number of different markets.  As far as the guarantee is concerned, the Government will receive substantial moneys from the banks.  It will be shy of the &euro;1 billion envisaged because the banks received substantial collateral support from the European Central Bank in respect of which the relevant fees could not be charged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>They would be dead except for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The bankers are not acting like that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not on foot of the guarantee that steps were taken to capitalise Anglo Irish Bank, and that is an entirely separate matter.  I do not quite understand the Deputy&rsquo;s argument in that respect.  I understood the Deputy as saying recently that the reason the Labour Party opposed the guarantee was because of subordinated debt, which I dealt with today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>

	<P>The Deputies were present.  I was not present at the committee hearing because I would not be present at a hearing when the author of a report I commissioned <Col N="689"/>was there.  I read the transcript and my understanding is that Professor Honohan was extremely coy on the subject of senior debt and how any question of senior debt could have arisen in 2008 or 2009.  He made it clear that to even mention such an idea in 2008 and 2009 could have accelerated a catastrophe.</P>

       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I pointed out in the banking statement on 30 March, the unavoidable reality is that the bank has incurred losses from its large-scale property lending and needs substantial further capital.  I also made clear that unpalatable as it is, only the taxpayer can provide this capital and in view of the significant costs of an immediate liquidation or wind-down of the bank, which I set out in my statement, this was the least worst option in light of the imperative of continuing to maintain overall financial stability.  I made it clear that there is simply no alternative that meets Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s unavoidable obligations at a lower cost consistent with the maintenance of the hard-won stability of the banking system in Ireland.</P>
        <P>For that reason, in addition to the promissory note provided to the bank at that time, to take account of the bank&rsquo;s losses to date I confirmed that the bank will need further capital to cover future losses and accomplish the restructuring of the bank and its balance sheet and this was estimated at that time to be of the order of the figure referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  In my statement I drew attention to the fact that notwithstanding very substantial work under way on the bank&rsquo;s restructuring plan, there are still significant uncertainties about this figure, including the size of the discount on all of its loans transferring to NAMA, the scale of future losses on its loans that are not transferred to NAMA and the exact nature and the scope of any split of the bank under its plans and the EU Commission decision on the plan.</P>
        <P>I advise the Deputy that the estimate provided at end of March remains the bank&rsquo;s base case estimate of the additional capital required, taking into account the further capital support provided at the end of May.  The figure was included as part of the bank&rsquo;s restructuring plan submitted to the European Commission at the end of May.  Work is continuing with the bank involving the NTMA, the Financial Regulator and my Department to refine this estimate in the context of ongoing discussions with the Commission on the restructuring plan.  However, the uncertainties I referred to in my banking statement remain with regard to, for example, the loan-by-loan assessment of the bank&rsquo;s loans transferred into NAMA.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that whereas the sums required to rescue the bank are enormous, the costs of winding it down are even greater.  The current bank strategy of seeking to devise a way to realise value for the taxpayer out of the remains of the old bank means the State could at least get some return, in time, recouping some of its assistance.  I can again assure the House that the bank shares my overriding objective to maximise the potential return for the taxpayer in recognition of the State support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>We had the chairman and management of Anglo Irish Bank before the finance committee yesterday.  The source of the &euro;10 billion figure is the discounts <Col N="690"/>provided by the bank itself on the NAMA-directed loans, with &euro;36.4 billion at 28%.  The first tranche went into NAMA at 55%, leading to the differential of &euro;10 billion.</P>
        <P>If between subordinated and senior debt in Anglo Irish Bank there is approximately &euro;7 billion available, the bank has proposed a good bank to recapitalise in the order of &euro;2.5 billion.  An extra &euro;8 billion is needed because &euro;2 billion of the &euro;10 billion has already gone into Anglo Irish Bank.  May I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s response to the previous question that he feels that a case of existing senior debt would not be guaranteed?  In the scenario of a good bank and bad bank in Anglo, are we effectively looking at &euro;8 billion, with &euro;2.5 billion of that going to the recapitalisation of the good bank, with &euro;5.5 billion going to the bad bank?  Should the bondholders take the pain rather than the taxpayer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not willing at this stage to make a definitive statement on how that would be approached.  Matters are with the Commission in Brussels and there are detailed and intensive discussions between the authorities at the Commission and my Department.  Officials from the Department are also in liaison with the Central Bank and the NTMA with regard to these matters.  It is important that the taxpayer be protected but I am not prepared to announce this afternoon in this House a default on senior debt.</P>
        <P>It has clearly been an accepted feature of the Government&rsquo;s approach to this financial and banking crisis that subordinated bondholders have to share the pain and take appreciable discounts.  With regard to that aspect of the question, I have made it clear that such debt will not be guaranteed after 29 September.  The markets are making their own judgments in these matters and I will not speculate on how the question will be approached other than to set out the general approach taken to date.</P>
        <P>With regard to senior debt and bonds, it is a far-reaching step for this country, given the amount of funding we require at the NTMA to fund the State and the amount of funding that Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and the other financial institutions require, to signal at this stage that in any sense the State envisages a default on the repayment of the principal sums of the senior debt in any institution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Some &euro;14 billion has already gone into Anglo Irish Bank, which is effectively a black hole.  The taxpayer will never again see that money.  There is a strong argument that Anglo Irish Bank falls into a completely different category.  With regard to opportunity cost for the taxpayer, I ask the Minister to look at the senior debt within Anglo Irish Bank in the context of saving &euro;5.5 billion for the Irish taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell has made the proposal, it will naturally be examined.  I will arrange for that and a reply will issue to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>However, as a small country which is dependent on international funding, Ireland must be extremely wary about any suggestion regarding a default on senior bonds.  Under Irish law, those who hold such bonds rank equally with depositors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Anglo Irish Bank is no longer of systemic importance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>If he will allow me to conclude, the Deputy will then be in a position to ask as many supplementary questions as he sees fit about this matter.  However, I make the point that these payments rank equal in status with those relating to all classes of ordinary depositors.  They relate to bonds which issue not just to some class of people which the Deputy&rsquo;s party chooses to characterise in a generic way but also to pension funds, credit unions and many other institutions, to which and in respect of which they provide a crucial source of finance.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  if he intends to introduce a new approach to the presentation of budget 2011 to allow independent assessment of the proposed fiscal stance and an informed debate about the choices he proposes and the consideration of alternatives.</Quest>
        <QRef>[25946/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, there have been many improvements in recent years to the budgetary process, including the publication of a pre-budget outlook, usually in October, a more multi-annual focus, including the introduction of capital expenditure envelopes, and the presentation of a unified budget, whereby expenditure and taxation measures are announced together, thus ensuring a more coherent approach to budgeting.  There are already a number of independent bodies, including the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Central Bank, which assess and comment on the economic and fiscal situation in Ireland.  Assessment is also carried out by international bodies such as the European Commission, the OECD and the IMF.  All of these contribute and help to inform the debate in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have worked to ensure more information is made publicly available than has been the case previously.  The report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes is one example in this regard.  In effect, it amounted to the early publication of expenditure plans and proposals well in advance of the budget.  The interest shown in it was remarkable and well in excess of 1 million people accessed it on the Department&rsquo;s website.  This is an example of how placing information in the public domain can induce a more realistic approach to the problems associated with public expenditure.  The position on the report of the Commission on Taxation which was the subject of early and prompt publication is similar.  Both reports will be important in identifying the future measures required to align more closely our tax revenues and expenditures in order that we can place the public finances on a more sustainable footing.</P>
        <P>The work of the National Economic and Social Council and its publications have also added considerably to the information available and the discussions relating to the choices to be made.  In November last year, following publication of the pre-budget outlook, the House engaged in a debate on budgetary options.  There have also been numerous discussions in the D&aacute;il on the economic and fiscal challenges we face and the very difficult choices that must be made. </P>
<P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">I am open to discussing further enhancements to the process of budget reform which I see as an evolving one.  In the context of the recent publication of the preliminary scoping reports into the causes of Ireland&rsquo;s banking crisis, the Government has asked the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to examine the key policy lessons in respect of macro-economic management as set out in the report by Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson.  One of the areas on which the committee&rsquo;s views have been sought is the case for independent institutional sources for economic and fiscal projections.</P>
        <P>There are also developments at EU level which are relevant.  In the light of the financial and economic difficulties being experienced in virtually all European countries, there is widespread acknowledgement of the need for a strengthening of budgetary and economic surveillance and co-ordination so as to reduce the likelihood of future budgetary crises.  A task force on improving budgetary discipline was mandated by the European Council in March to advance work on this issue.  The recent European Commission&rsquo;s communication on reinforcing economic policy co-ordination is informing the discussion taking place at the task force which is chaired by the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy.  The mandate of the task force is, <Col N="692"/><i>inter alia</i>, to propose measures for better budgetary discipline and an improved crisis resolution framework, particularly within the euro area.  The President will present an interim report to the European Council today and present a final report in October.</P>
        <P>I have attended the meetings of President Van Rompuy&rsquo;s task force and welcome its constructive work in this important area.  We will need to see its specific recommendations in due course, but it is clear that closer economic governance and broader and deeper examination of budgetary policies, without prejudice to the role of national parliaments, are now being sought at EU level, particularly within the euro area.  This will have implications for all member states, not just Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The UK Government recently established the Office for Budgetary Responsibility which has clearly bolstered confidence in the bond markets.  Fine Gael has suggested an independent fiscal council, similar to the office in the United Kingdom to which I refer, should be established in this country.  The same suggestion was contained in the Regling and Watson report.  Will the Minister give consideration to establishing such a council?  If a body of this nature had been in place previously, certain tax incentive schemes might have been curbed much earlier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am giving consideration to the establishment of such a body.  That is one of the reasons the Government requested the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to engage in further arduous labour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is keeping us busy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that the joint committee has a sizeable work schedule, but I felt obliged to ask it to examine the three general economic questions posed by Messrs Regling and Watson in their report and revert to the Government with its views in this regard as soon as possible.  We need to examine the possibility of establishing such a council.</P>
        <P>I disagree, however, with the Deputy on one aspect of this matter.  I am not sure whether we should pursue the United Kingdom&rsquo;s example in this regard.  By virtue of our membership of the eurozone and the European Union, we are already under a surveillance obligation in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact.  It is true that the United Kingdom is under a similar obligation.  However, it is interesting that during the discussions engaged in by the Van Rompuy task force the UK representatives made clear their position that they did not perceive a need for intensification of that surveillance.</P>
        <P>While, in formal terms, the Stability and Growth Pact may not distinguish between members of the eurozone and other member states, in the light of our experience in the past year, it is clear that there is a fundamental difference in respect of the appraisal that takes place on the fiscal front.  The title &ldquo;fiscal council&rdquo;, used by many people, borrows a view of the English language common in other EU member states.  However, I remain open to suggestions regarding what might be the appropriate title for such a council.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  his projections for the growth of interest payments on Government debt as a proportion of taxes collected by 2011 and by 2013.</Quest>
        <QRef>[24747/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on the projections for the Exchequer borrowing requirement for the years to 2014 set out in budget 2010, the estimated cost of interest on the national debt will be approximately &euro;5.75 billion in 2011 and &euro;7.5 billion in 2013.  The National Treasury Management Agency has advised that, as is usual, these estimates were prepared on the basis of the prevailing market conditions for Irish Government bonds.  Based on these estimates and the projections for tax revenue for the years to 2014 as set out in budget 2010, it is forecast that the proportion of tax revenue that will be accounted for by interest payments on the national debt will amount to 17.5% in 2011 and 20% in 2013.</P>
        <P>Borrowing at current levels is not a sustainable long-term option.  As debt servicing costs have first call on resources, an increasing debt interest burden will lead to higher interest costs, thereby reducing the resources available for the provision of public services in the future.  This underlines the importance of continuing to take the necessary action to restore stability to the public finances.  That is why, since mid-2008, the Government has been taking the decisive action that will help restore sustainability to the budgetary position.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to restoring order to the public finances through reducing the deficit to below 3% of GDP by the end of 2014.  Recent market developments highlight the importance of continuing to take firm and decisive action in this regard.  The Government&rsquo;s plan to reduce its general deficit to less than 3% of GDP by the end of 2014 has met with the approval of many, including the European Commission, the ECB, the OECD and the IMF.  Considerable progress has already been made towards achieving this target.  Fiscal adjustments designed to yield 5% of GDP in 2009 were implemented between July 2008 and April 2009.  Budget 2010 implemented a further set of adjustments &mdash; mainly on the expenditure side &mdash; amounting to 2.5% of GDP.   The most recent Exchequer returns to the end of May show that <Col N="694"/>the Government&rsquo;s actions are having a positive effect and that we are on track to meet our budgetary targets for 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s focus now is on securing the necessary adjustments for budget 2011 and work is under way in that regard.  In terms of the amount involved, &euro;3 billion was set out in budget 2010 as the necessary adjustment for 2011 and, contrary to much recent speculation, the European Commission has agreed that this is the correct amount.  Some &euro;1 billion of this sum will come from the capital expenditure side and the balance of &euro;2 billion will come from the current side of the budget and involve a mix of expenditure and taxation measures.  The precise breakdown of this adjustment is a matter for ongoing determination in the context of the formulation of budget 2011.  At this stage, I cannot comment on the specifics of the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister will, in respect of the &euro;3 billion mentioned, provide the House with a broad breakdown between expenditure and taxation.  Perhaps also he will comment on the fact that relative to other countries our bond spreads are and have been consistently high.  Does he agree with the view that we continue to have a credibility issue with which to deal in terms of the budget measures introduced in 2007 and 2008 which were a little too late and how does he intend to address the bonds crisis in terms of borrowing on the international markets?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the broad breakdown of the figure, I have already outlined the position in respect of the &euro;1 billion on the capital side.  On the other &euro;2 billion and the breakdown as between day-to-day expenditure and taxation, I am not in a position at this stage to give a definitive figure in that regard.  I cannot give a definitive figure because at end June we will have the mid-year returns in respect of taxation and expenditure at which stage the Government will begin its consideration of the broad thrust of budgetary policy.  I am not in a position at this stage in advance of that Government deliberation to give a precise figure in respect of the breakdown between taxation and expenditure.  Even after the Government commences its consideration of that issue, it will be considerably later in the year, in the context of the budgetary figures, before a final determination of those figures can be given.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year, we collected &euro;32 billion in taxes.  The Minister is saying that commencing next year at least &euro;5 billion will be spent on paying down interest.  This means that one in every six euro collected in taxes will be used to pay off interest on the debt, including the bailout of Anglo Irish Bank.  As the Minister stated, the Government is hoping the European Union will allow it to write off the promissory note.  It is a shocking indictment of the Government&rsquo;s approach that one in every six euro of all taxes will go to pay down the debt.  That is what the Minister is effectively saying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The bulk of that debt has accumulated as a result of the gap between Government receipts and expenditure, current and capital.  The total overall cost of the bank rescue package in relation to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society will be, as Deputy Bruton knows, spread over a long period and will be offset by gains which the State has made in respect of payments on foot of the guarantee, payments from Bank of Ireland, prospective payments from Allied Irish Banks and other results of the State&rsquo;s investments in the banking sector.  The core crucial central issue which must be addressed, which the Labour Party has singularly abstained from addressing in the past two years, is the gap that exists between the current and capital expenditures by State and the receipts and revenues available to it.  That is the central issue that must be addressed by any occupant of this office.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  if he is satisfied that the top level appointments committee gives reasonable scope for appointments from outside the public service and outside the appointing Departments. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24775/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, holds competitions for and advises Ministers and the Government on appointments to Civil Service posts at Secretary General, Deputy Secretary, Assistant Secretary and equivalent levels.  Since early 2007 the policy has been that open competitions are held for Assistant Secretary, Deputy Secretary and equivalent posts.  This policy has been recently extended to Secretary General posts, with the exception of a limited number of Secretary General posts which are filled by the Government without a TLAC competition.  Where open competitions are held the normal practice is that the Public Appointments Service holds a preliminary competition and selects a shortlist of candidates for interview by the Top Level Appoints Committee, TLAC.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the committee and the preliminary interview boards under the Public Appointments Service carry out their functions in a fair and objective manner.  In any industry or business where posts are filled by an open recruitment process, one would expect candidates with experience of the business or industry to have an advantage and there is no reason the Civil Service should be any different.  Some very credible external candidates, successful and unsuccessful, have come forward in competitions held to date but overall the proportion of external candidates with the levels of management experience and competencies that would make them suitable for appointment has been lower than one might have hoped for.</P>
        <P>I will shortly be bringing proposals to the Government to restructure the Top Level Appointments Committee as provided for in the renewed programme for Government.  However, I would stress that I do not consider that the composition of the committee is the main reason so few external candidates have been successful.  I will also be proposing that the committee needs to consider new approaches to attract stronger external fields, including in appropriate cases an element of &ldquo;head-hunting&rdquo;, while recognising that even where suitable candidates are identified in this way they would still have too undergo a competitive process.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his reply.  By way of clarification, I have not been given any new appointment in the past few minutes. I am merely here to assist my colleague who had to go to vote in a different room.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister will inform the House of what percentage of appointments to the type of jobs outlined by him have in the past two years come from outside of the public service.  The Minister stated that there has been a disappointing lack of management skills from some of the applicants outside the public sector.  I find that difficult to believe in the current environment when there are many people out of work who have significant management skills.  Perhaps the Minister will assure the House he will ensure that when we are filling high level posts through a process of competition and selection that it will be a meritocracy and that people from the private sector will have as good a chance of securing those posts as have people coming from within the public sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not have exact figures in that regard.  However, as I understand it, the number of outside appointments has been limited.  I do not have the figures before me but will arrange to have them sent to the Deputy.  The Government has decided that Secretary General posts must be filled by open competition with the exception of those posts to which appointments are made by the Government without competition, including Secretary General to the Government and the Department of the Taoiseach, Secretary General to the Department of Finance, Secretary General for public service management and development, Department of Finance, Secretary General to the Department of Foreign Affairs, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and Secretary General at the Office of the President.</P>
        <P>Ten posts were circulated in 2009, seven of which were at Assistant Secretary level, of which four were open to applicants from outside the public sector; three were at Secretary General, of which one was open to applicants outside the public sector.  Taking 2010 statistics for the Civil Service as a whole, 16 posts have been posted so far, 11 of which were at Assistant Secretary level, all of which were open to applicants from outside the public sector; two were at Secretary General level, one of which at the Department of Social Protection, was open to applicants from outside the public sector, the other at the Office of the Attorney General being open only to applicants from within the public sector given it is specialised in character; one was at Second Secretary General level and was open to applicants outside the public sector; two were at Deputy Secretary level, one of which was open to applicants from outside the public sector, the other being open only to applicants from within the Civil Service.</P>

	<P>I will allow a supplementary question from Deputy Burton.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Regling and Watson and Honohan reports identify an appalling lack of expertise in the Department of Finance.  Maybe the Department has accountants and I believe it has economists, but they did not seem to be in a position to contribute to warding off the collapse, particularly the collapse in Irish Nationwide and Anglo Irish Bank.  I recall civil servants from the Department of Finance advising me that the senior management of those institutions were extraordinarily knowledgeable and well placed to command the affairs of the institutions and were, pretty much, irreplaceable.  I found that notion extraordinary and still find it so.  The Department of Finance needs people with specific professional skill sets, which they have practised in areas such as accountancy.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of the one person who came into the Minister&rsquo;s Department as an assistant secretary and was referred to in <i>The Sunday Business Post  </i>last weekend.  That person was at a senior level in the Department, left to go to a consulting position and then returned.  Someone who goes out, gets experience and comes back is valuable but that is hardly a revolution.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="697"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s more general point is correct.  Much of the focus in the question has been on senior positions.  It is quite difficult to obtain private interest in those senior positions.  Some of this is bound up with the question of pension provision and there are wider remuneration questions.  It is not simply a matter of an administrative culture refusing to accept outsiders although, in the context of the review of the top level appointments committee arrangements, I am conscious of the need to ensure there are adequate safeguards against that.  There is a wider pension provision issue, which militates against outside applications. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Burton&rsquo;s point is of particular importance.  I agree with her and I am  examining this matter with my officials at present.  It is extremely important that the necessary skills sets exist in the Department of Finance.  That is not a question that relates to top level appointments.  It arises at middle range qualifications and appointments.  We have arranged for the appointment of a banking analyst in the Department and the necessary procedures to recruit this individual had to take place outside the normal Civil Service recruitment procedures.  There is, clearly, a need to complement that approach in the fields of accountancy and other areas, although there is a wealth of economic expertise in my Department.</P>

	<P>The Regling and Watson and Honohan reports both express amazement at the failure to identify the level of risk at an earlier period in the banks.  It appears that the risk was in front of their faces but they could not see it.  Furthermore, the issue of solvency was never addressed.  The focus was all on liquidity.  Was that due to a lack of expertise or a lack of procedures in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s office and the Department of Finance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is answered in the reports and in Professor Honohan&rsquo;s comments the other day to the joint committee.

        <asker>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>  his views on the end of May Exchequer returns which showed a tax revenue shortfall of more than &euro;1.4 billion compared to the same period in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[25608/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">At the end of May, &euro;12.1 billion in tax revenue receipts had been collected.  As Deputy Lynch points out in her question, this is a drop of approximately &euro;1.4 billion on the amount collected in the first five months of 2009, which represents a year-on-year decline of 10.4%.  However, the monthly profiles for tax revenue published in early February, anticipated a significant year-on-year decline in the initial months of 2010, with receipts expected to recover during the course of the year to finish the year 6% down on 2009 in overall terms. This would represent a fall of just under &euro;2 billion for the year as a whole.</P>
        <P>In terms of the Government&rsquo;s budgetary targets, it is more appropriate to look at the performance of tax revenues against the monthly profiles.  Overall, tax receipts in the first five months of the year were just &euro;148 million below the target of &euro;12.3 billion.  This represents a shortfall of just 1%.  While this is a slight worsening of the position at end-April, when receipts were on target, it should be noted that the amount scheduled for collection in May was large, representing the second highest monthly target for 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the individual taxheads, receipts from VAT, corporation tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and customs were all above target at the end of May, while income tax, excise duties and stamp duties were all below profile. The overall shortfall was largely driven by income tax receipts, which were &euro;219 million below target for the first five months of the year.  While the weakness evident in income tax receipts may be seen as a cause for some concern, it is too early to draw any conclusions for the outcome for the year as a whole.  There has been considerable movement in the months to date, with income tax receipts hitting target in the months of March and April but falling short in the month of May.  This performance has been echoed in other tax heads, most notably VAT and corporation tax, where shortfalls in some months have been offset by surpluses in other months.  While there are significant targets to meet in the months ahead, and no clear trend has emerged as yet, the budget 2010 forecast for tax revenues of just over &euro;31 billion remains valid.  We will assess the position further in light of the end of June Exchequer returns.</P>

        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">On the expenditure side, the end-May Exchequer returns also showed that the expenditure control decisions taken by Government are having an effect.  Total net voted expenditure was down by &euro;1.7 billion or 9% on the same period in 2009.</P>
        <P>The overall Exchequer deficit at end-May was &euro;7.9 billion, down from the &euro;10.6 billion recorded in the same period last year.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government has long acknowledged that the gap between revenues and expenditure is unsustainable.  A multi-annual framework to restore stability to the public finances and to reduce the general Government deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2014 has been set out.  The European Commission, the ECB, the IMF, the OECD and respected international economic commentators are among those who have welcomed the plan.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="699"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister concerned that the structural deficit and the huge loss in revenue from the construction industry are gone forever?  They will now be down at a very modest level.  Has the Minister identified the ongoing loss from that deficit?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept that if he can get people back to work &mdash;  including work experience, graduate interneeship and apprenticeships, which the Labour Party has proposed &mdash; a couple of things can happen relatively quickly?  When someone returns to work there is a saving in social welfare payments and, slowly but surely, the person&rsquo;s spending increases and they become a contributor to the income tax receipts.  In addition, every time someone loses his or her job the cost to the State is about &euro;10,000 per year in social welfare benefits.  The debt spiral of deflation, as Ben Bernanke has described it in the United States, is not a good idea.  More severe cutting causes job losses.  The Minister&rsquo;s preference for cutting capital causes the deflationary spiral to get worse.</P>
        <P>How does the Minister think EUROSTAT will treat the extra billions going to Anglo Irish Bank?  Last year, the Minister disagreed with me when I said the &euro;4 billion would count in our deficit, and it did.  It now looks as though the &euro;10 billion extra will not be &euro;1 billion per year but rather &euro;10 billion in one year.  Can the Minister give a view on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course I am concerned.  I have been concerned for a considerable period about the structural loss in our tax base occasioned by the property bust.  The effect of it has been a substantial depletion in the amount the State received in capital gains tax and stamp duty receipts.  I agree that has been a very serious problem.  Any Government would be concerned about it, naturally.  That is why the Commission on Taxation has made proposals for broadening the tax base and ensuring it is less elastic in the future.  Clearly, one of the lessons highlighted in the reports is that a tax base which is subject to rapid upward and downward changes in tax receipts, because of the elastic character of certain receipts, is not structurally viable for the future.  The Government is examining the proposals in that regard.  I will bring proposals to the Cabinet in the context of this year&rsquo;s budget to ensure our tax base is more reliable in the years ahead.  I agree that both factors &mdash; employment measures and general confidence in the economy &mdash; have to be attended to if we are to generate a viable revenue base.</P>
        <P>Initiatives of the type mentioned by the Deputy &mdash; graduate internships and back to work arrangements, etc. &mdash; can be brought into operation now that final agreement has been reached on the Croke Park deal.  It is disappointing that it took so long for that to happen.  Now that agreement has been arrived at, we have an opportunity to make progress with these issues.  Proposals that would generate confidence, in terms of income tax and employment numbers, can be pursued.  I place considerable emphasis on the importance of sustaining general confidence in the economy so that individuals spend money and make investment decisions.  Fiscal correction is necessary as part of the climate of sustaining confidence.  Many people have called for a stimulus package.  Our level of borrowing is such that it amounts, in itself, to the only stimulus package &mdash; and a substantial one at that &mdash; in which the Government can engage, with the exception of supply side stimulus measures that can be considered in specific sectors.</P>
        <P>Having agreed with the first two points made by Deputy Burton, I would like to take issue with her third point.  I do not have a preference for cutting the public capital programme.  We have maintained capital investment at a very high level.  Many of the reductions in the total volume of capital expenditure can be justified in terms of the cheaper tendering prices for elements of physical infrastructure that now exist.  The question of how EUROSTAT will treat the capital sums that are required in connection with Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, with which the Deputy concluded, is a matter for EUROSTAT.  Clearly, the Department of Finance will liaise with EUROSTAT on the appropriate treatment of these matters.  It is fair <Col N="700"/>to indicate, as the Deputy did in her question, that a precedent that may have to be followed in relation to further payments has been set.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to ask the Minister about the mechanism for forecasting the tax revenue shortfall.  Will he make available to me his current estimates in relation to the interest costs for this year?  It seems to me that we are not getting the full picture when it comes to the costs that apply to Anglo Irish Bank and the treatment of that bank.  I was surprised to hear of the amounts of money the Minister has committed to the smaller institutions, such the as the EBS and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  I do not know whether the Minister was surprised to have to do so.  We all know the Irish Nationwide Building Society would be another dead duck if it was not for its deposit book.  Can the Minister give us an updated figure for the total amounts involved in the Government bank recapitalisation programme and the interests costs arising therefrom?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The interest costs arise from Exchequer borrowing, which is arranged by the NTMA.  I can arrange for the NTMA to make an estimate.  That estimate would be subject to revision at the end of the year.  That is normally done before the budget.  A final definitive figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That has a very limited impact this year.  The figure for this year will be drawn up by the NTMA towards the close of the year.  On the separate question of bank capitalisation, I will arrange for Deputy Burton to be given the information she has sought on the institutions as a whole.  The State now owns a controlling share in the EBS.  The Oireachtas committee may well wish to make investigations with regard to the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The figure for the amount of the loss is far more definitive in the case of a smaller society like that than in the case of Anglo Irish Bank.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Acting Chairman is well acquainted with the issues I propose to address during this debate.  The difficulties that were experienced last September, when the swimming pool at the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Centre was closed due to a lack of funding for its refurbishment, represented a major setback for the Daughters of Charity, who run the centre.  Swimming pools are of wonderful value &mdash; for rehabilitation purposes, for example &mdash; in centres where many people receive services on a residential or day care basis.  The swimming pool has been closed for some time now.  It was one of the first serious cutbacks in the services being provided to intellectually challenged people at the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Centre.  As the Acting Chairman knows, the Daughters of Charity have been providing an excellent service at the centre, which is based on the Navan Road in Dublin, for a long period of time.  Approximately 300 people are catered for there on a residential or day care basis.  The centre is a well respected institution in the community.</P>
        <P>A bombshell landed on the Daughters of Charity last month when the HSE indicated they would have to pare &euro;4 million from their services by the end of the year.  If they had been given that information six months ago, it would have been easier for them to adjust.  The cuts will be exacerbated because they will have to be made in the remaining half of the year.  They will be sharper in the areas in which they fall.  The first requirement indicated by the HSE is that 56 staff members will have to be taken off the payroll.  Overall staff numbers will have to be reduced from 1,046 to 990.  A sanction in the form of a 5% cut has been threatened if quarterly targets are not achieved.  These measures will affect the services being provided at the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Centre.  The HSE has already instructed the closure of the Ard Cuan respite care centre on the Old Cabra Road by 30 June next.  All service users, including their families, were only told about this on 8 June, which was very short notice.  The entire service provided off-campus is closing down entirely.</P>
        <P>On top of this, the respite care service at the Sancta Maria unit, on-campus at the Navan Road centre, will be reduced to being provided four nights, Monday to Thursday.  The number of family support hours provided for will also be significantly reduced.  The opening hours of Connect, the after-school club, will also be significantly reduced, while the annual summer camp will not be able to function because there is no money to provide support.  Parents will have to pay for the transport of their children to Deck, another service provided in the summer, if it will be able to function, which is unlikely.  The skills development programme will have to close for four weeks instead of the usual three in the summer.  Staff members have been informed that they will have to take an extra week&rsquo;s holidays at their own expense or be redeployed to some other area.  These are severe cutbacks which are being implemented in the middle of the summer.  The management of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Centre is endeavouring to ensure <Col N="702"/>residential and day care services will be maintained as well as possible for the remainder of the year.</P>
        <P>As I said, the centre has already had to close its swimming pool owing to lack of funding for refurbishment.  One would expect services provided for one of the most vulnerable sectors of the community &mdash; people with intellectual disabilities &mdash; would be the last to be hit, but they have been targeted in this case.  I urge the Minister to consider what can be done to reverse these cutbacks.  The cutbacks to funding for librarians in disadvantaged areas who were to be given the chop in August last year were reversed last week.  This service was important, particularly in terms of promoting literacy and numeracy, and I am thankful the Minister saw fit to reverse that decision because much good work has been done.  I now ask the Minister to consider reversing this &euro;4 million cutback in the service provided by the Daughters of Charity in Dublin.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  I thank the Deputy for raising it and I am pleased to take the opportunity to outline the position on funding for the Daughters of Charity services at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Centre, Navan Road, Dublin 7.</P>
        <P>I reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing high quality services for all people with a disability under the national disability strategy which has the objective of putting in place the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for people with disabilities.  The strategy is the framework being used to achieve positive and active measures to support the participation of people with disabilities in society.  Government policy and best practice recognise that clients and service users need to be at the centre of service delivery.  On an ongoing basis, we are examining the way in which services are delivered to ensure people with disabilities are provided with the best possible services in an efficient and appropriate manner.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment in the area of disability and mental health is consistent.  Overall, approximately &euro;1.6 billion is spent annually by the health service on disability programmes, including residential, day care, respite, assessments and rehabilitation services.  In recent years significant additional resources have been provided for services and supports in this area.  The multi-annual investment programme 2006-09, a key component of the Government&rsquo;s disability strategy, had by the end of 2008 provided for approximately 804 new residential places, 307 new respite places and 1,863 new day places for the intellectual disability service and 275 new residential places and 911,626 extra home care or personal assistance hours for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised the Minister for Health and Children that it is very much aware of the valuable contribution of the services provided by the Daughters of Charity for people with intellectual disabilities in Dublin.  During the period of the multi-annual investment programme the Daughters of Charity services received funding from the HSE in the region of &euro;85.126 million in 2005, &euro;94.748 million in 2006, &euro;101.301 million in 2007, &euro;106.790 million in 2008 and &euro;110.542 million in 2009.  This sustained level of additional investment reflected the significant growth and development of the Daughters of Charity services throughout this period.</P>
        <P>The HSE is aware of the challenges service providers, including the Daughters of Charity, are experiencing and the particular difficulties facing all health services in 2010.  In this context, it is vital that all providers work creatively and co-operatively to ensure the maximum level of service is maintained for service users within the funding resources available.  The HSE plans to maintain access to appropriate treatments and services for clients during 2010, despite the <Col N="703"/>current resource pressures.  It is aware of the challenges which this reduction in allocation will present to organisations in ensuring they meet the needs of service users and in planning for emergencies that arise throughout the year.  It is recognised that the maintaining of service levels within available resources will require significant levels of co-operation, change, flexibility and creativity.  The HSE will continue to work in partnership with the voluntary service providers in dealing with issues that arise from funding allocations to ensure the needs of service users are prioritised and addressed.</P>
        <P>Disability service providers have been requested to submit their plans for the maintenance of service levels within available resources.  They have been asked to review all items of expenditure which do not immediately and directly affect front-line services and consider where rationalisation can be effected in other areas; review the manner in which services are delivered; identify any opportunities to reduce costs by sharing services and-or activities with other statutory or non-statutory agencies; reduce the cost of back office administration functions and all other unnecessary costs; and consider rationalising general management structures.  The HSE will continue to work with voluntary service providers to streamline costs and identify areas in which efficiencies can be achieved without affecting front-line service delivery.</P>

	<P>In July 2006, 37 staff from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs moved to new advance offices in Tubbercurry, County Sligo.  The plan was that the staff would be based there temporarily pending construction of a new headquarters at Knock Airport in County Mayo.  Later other sections of the Department transferred to Tubbercurry.  For the past six years the staff in question have been working effectively at the Tubbercurry location and, by all accounts, have settled into a successful and happy lifestyle.</P>
        <P>The former Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, for whom I have tremendous respect and who was committed to rural regeneration during his time as Minister, had originally planned for the relocation of the Department to Knock Airport.  This move never happened, as the proposed office building at Knock Airport did not receive planning permission.  It was then proposed that the staff would move to Charlestown.  When that option was rejected, a facility in Kiltimagh was examined, but it has now been rejected.  It is clear that there are no suitable premises at Knock Airport and that the premises identified in Charlestown and Kiltimagh have been established as being unsuitable.  Planning for an eventual move by staff to a County Mayo location is no longer feasible or practical.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is now an air of unreality about the commitment of the former Minister to move staff to County Mayo.  I accept that he made his original commitment in good faith; however, six years on, it is time for the current Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey, to re-evaluate the situation.  The staff working and living in Tubbercurry are uncertain about their long-term work and living locations.  All of the staff who transferred to Tubbercurry are well settled into the local community and do not wish to uproot and move again.  For their part, the local Tubbercurry community has made them welcome and did everything possible to ensure the new arrivals were integrated smoothly.  Tubbercurry and the wider south Sligo area have benefited economically and socially from the arrival of the departmental staff.  In addition, some new jobs have been created in business support and related activities.</P>
        <P>I fully support the broad decentralisation programme.  The Western Development Commission carried out a study of the beneficial impact of decentralised offices in various parts of the country, particularly the west, and noted that the economic impact of the relocation of jobs to the western region had been positive and significant.</P><Col N="704"/>
      
        <P>Public sector employees have taken up opportunities to relocate to the western region for quality of life reasons.  I refer to the many benefits realised by easier commuting to work.  The western region offers many advantages, some of which we heard yesterday in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, in terms of cost savings and benefits from living in a close community, being closer to family and living in a rural location.  Eventually the western rail track will come to Tubbercurry.</P>
        <P>The relocation of Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs public sector jobs to Tubbercurry brought major benefits to south Sligo.  Will the Minister confirm that staff will remain in Tubbercurry, and will he confirm that any necessary work to ensure the best working conditions for staff will be carried out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the decentralisation programme, 140 staff of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs were due to decentralise to Knock Airport.  However, following a decision in 2008 by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to refuse planning permission for the development of the Department&rsquo;s headquarters at Knock Airport, the Government decided in October 2008 to proceed with the decentralisation of the Department&rsquo;s headquarters to Charlestown, County Mayo.</P>
        <P>Following the announcement of Government to decentralise the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, it was decided to relocate an advance party to temporary accommodation in Tubbercurry, County Sligo.  From the total of the 140 staff due to decentralise to Charlestown, County Mayo, a total of 100 staff have now relocated to Tubbercurry, County Sligo.  A significant number of the business units of the Department, including the full rural, community and financial business units, are operating successfully in Tubbercurry, where two properties are being rented to accommodate the staff concerned.</P>
        <P>The two properties in Tubbercurry, County Sligo, which the Department are currently occupying, were selected for the Department by the Office of Public Works, which is responsible for the acquisition and rental of State property.  These properties meet all the requirements of the Office of Public Works.  The Office of Public Works is currently leasing the two properties in question and has leases on the premises until July 2012.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s statement that new proposals that the staff transfer to Kiltimagh have been examined and rejected, I confirm that in May 2009 the Government was approached regarding the suitability of a building in Kiltimagh as a headquarters for the Department.  The Government requested the OPW to carry out a review of this accommodation and to assess whether it was suitable for the Department&rsquo;s headquarters.  The advice received from the OPW was that the building at Kiltimagh was not suitable for the Department&rsquo;s headquarters and did not meet the physical requirements of the Department.</P>
        <P>It is not the case that new proposals that the staff transfer to Charlestown have been examined and rejected.  The position is that in light of budgetary constraints and affordability issues, the Government decided to defer proceeding with permanent accommodation in Charlestown at this time.  This location, along with four other deferred projects &mdash; Drogheda, The Curragh, Mullingar and Carlow &mdash; will be considered as part of the overall review of the decentralisation programme in 2011.</P>

      <sTitle>Local Authority Housing</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="ChrisAndrews"><NameTxt>Deputy Chris Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>In Dublin South East over the past 18 months I have noticed an increasing number of flats being left vacant even though there is a massive demand for social housing.  Social housing lists are under severe strain.  In Dublin 2, Dublin 4, Dublin 6 and Dublin 8 there are more than 240 flats lying idle.  At a conservative estimate, that would accommodate <Col N="705"/>500 people.  This would cater for a significant number of individuals and families who could live in more suitable accommodation.  At present, there are adults with two or three children living in a one-bedroom flat while they see a vacant two-bedroom flat next door.  It appears that nothing is done with these properties.  The people are obviously frustrated.</P>
        <P>A person came to me recently and told me he was considering squatting.  I cannot blame people for this.  I would probably do the same if I was in his shoes.  However, that will not solve the Minister&rsquo;s difficulties.  The Minister has done a major job and allocated considerable funding.  Some &euro;7 million has been allocated to retrofitting voids and energy ratings, &euro;2 million has been allocated to compliance with new rental standards and &euro;1.7 million has been allocated for improvement works on flats.  Under section 58 of the Housing Act 1966, the management and maintenance of local authority housing stock, which is largely financed from internal resources, is a matter of for each housing authority.  During the boom years, Dublin City Council used to employ contractors to improve the flats and subsequently allocate them.  Now, times are different.  BER statements are taking a considerable length of time and the local authorities are failing to certify flats.  If the prospective tenant is willing to accept a flat in its current condition, it should be allocated on that basis.  This would allow the accommodation and the housing stock to be used up.  The Minister has developed initiatives to ease the pressure on the social housing list.  I am not sure how much support he is getting from the local authorities.  He has drawn up a range of measures to tackle the difficulties and challenges of the social housing lists.</P>
        <P>It is not acceptable that some 240 flats in a very small area are lying idle and this matter should not be left to the council.  That accommodation should be allocated as a matter of urgency.  The Government should intervene and tell the manager that the job is not being done.  I am not sure where the council spends money or whether it has been allocated enough money.  However, a scheme should be set up so that an emergency fund is provided and Dublin City Council must meet certain targets before money is allocated to the council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Andrews for giving me an opportunity to outline the significant funding and progress on refurbishment of vacant Dublin City Council flats in Dublin South-East and elsewhere.  My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and local services, Deputy Michael Finneran, supports an ambitious social housing programme with new and ongoing projects under way throughout the country.  It is a matter for Dublin City Council to determine the content of their programmes including any plans for social housing refurbishment in Dublin South-East, taking into account existing commitments, priority projects and any related co-funding and timescale considerations subject to compliance with any necessary departmental sanction, terms and conditions.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;179.085 million was allocated to the city council for its social housing programme in 2010, including &euro;94.340 million for housing supply and &euro;75.745 million for housing improvement.  The housing improvement allocation included &euro;62.295 million for regeneration, &euro;2.7 million for remedial works, &euro;7 million for retrofitting voids and energy upgrades, &euro;2 million for compliance with new rental standards and &euro;1.75 million for improvement works, such as extensions and conversions to meet special needs.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and local services is also committed to a multi-annual regeneration programme in Dublin city to help to improve the lives and conditions of the communities involved.  Over the past decade, the Government has invested more than &euro;100 million in the Dublin City Council inner city flats regeneration programme and the Minister has allocated a further &euro;11.5 million in 2010 to support regeneration and improvement works in the inner city area.</P>
        <P>The number of vacant local authority units nationwide is reported on in the annual local authority service indicators report.</P><Col N="706"/>
        <P>The end 2007 report showed that a total of 5,090 dwellings, excluding those that were subject to major refurbishment programmes, were empty across the country. This represented 4.3% of the total stock of 118,000 dwellings.  The 2008 report shows a decrease of 1,231 on the 2007 total &mdash; a 24% improvement &mdash; bringing the number of vacant units down nationally to 3,859, or 3.15% of total stock.</P>
        <P>In order to achieve further improvements, especially energy efficiency improvements, a fund of &euro;40 million was set aside in 2010 to provide co-funding for the retrofitting of vacant properties, both casual and planned, across local authority housing stock.  The allocation to Dublin City Council of &euro;7 million for retrofitting voids and energy upgrades, &euro;2.7 million for remedial works and &euro;2 million for compliance with new rented standards will have a very positive impact on improving vacant houses and flats across the city, to facilitate the early re-letting of such properties.</P>
        <P>I point out that under section 58 of the Housing Act 1966, the management and maintenance of local authority housing stock is a matter for individual authorities.  I am happy to say that Dublin City Council has the full support from the Minister of State with responsibility for housing for its social housing investment programme and, in particular, for its delivery of a range of housing responses to meet additional housing needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important issue.  Rural Ireland requires the services of various Departments and, from a rural perspective, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food offices have been an absolute requirement for the dispersed farming and rural community.  A Government decision was taken in line with budgetary and economic matters to control spending in that Department, which I can understand.  However, at the time an effort was made to undermine to some extent the work that is carried out in those offices.  Some sought to suggest that much of the work could be dealt with over the telephone or on the Internet.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  </P>
        <P>It is an absolute requirement that a number of satellite or part-time offices be established in those counties affected by the closure of their central district veterinary office.  In the case of County Clare, a workable solution would be to have a satellite or temporary office within the confines of Ennis Mart, a location where farmers congregate on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  This would provide an adequate and appropriate location for the services of the Department, especially in regard to veterinary matters, and would ensure that farmers had easy access to those services.  In recent weeks farmers have found considerable difficulty in getting through the office in Limerick, now the designated office for County Clare farmers, despite their consistent efforts to reach or make contact with that office by telephone.  This is creating great levels of frustration, especially for those farmers who require services for getting permits to have diseased animals slaughtered and many other regular interactions they would have with Department offices.</P>
        <P>The suggestion that much of this business is transacted now over the Internet is a fallacy.  Some larger farmers may have business of a kind that enables them to conduct it over the Internet but for the vast majority, especially smaller farmers, of whom there are many in County Clare, it is not acceptable to suggest they can transact their business in this way.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to give serious consideration to this.  I do not believe there would be any &mdash;  or at least, not many &mdash; additional costs associated with having a member of departmental personnel located on a site within the mart complex in Ennis a number of days <Col N="707"/>a week.  There would be no increase in staff complement arising from such a decision and it would show a very strong commitment by the Department to service the farming community.</P>
        <P>It is important this be dealt with now because there is a considerable amount of hardship as a result of the inability of some to make telephone contact with the Department.  In addition, it is a complex journey to reach the office in Limerick, particularly from the north and west of the county.  For that reason, I appeal again to the Minister of State to review this matter at the earliest opportunity.  I do not ask him to incur any additional expense on behalf of the Department but to utilise existing services in an efficient manner that provides the best available service to the farming community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Timmy Dooley for raising this matter with me.  On 15 July last year, the Government approved a plan for a reorganisation of my Department&rsquo;s local office network.  The plan involves reducing, from 57 to 16, the number of offices from which my Department will operate district veterinary, forestry and agricultural environment and structures support services.  To this end nine new regional offices have been established at Castlebar, Drumshanbo, Enniscorthy, Navan, Limerick, Roscommon town, Tipperary town, Tralee and Waterford city.  Seven further new regional offices are soon to be established at Cavan, Clonakilty, Fermoy, Galway, Naas, Raphoe and Tullamore.  More than half of the 41 local offices planned to close have closed to the public and the remainder are to close shortly.</P>
        <P>The local office network reorganisation plan is an important phase in the ongoing overall reorganisation of my Department, which has seen staff numbers in my Department reduced by over 750 including the transfer of approximately 400 staff to other Departments, mainly the Department of Justice and Law Reform, for the operation of the PULSE system in Castlebar, and local offices of the Department of Social Protection and other Departments.  In addition, some 600 staff were redeployed internally to new and expanding work areas including the single payment scheme and the implementation of new environmental, food safety and animal health controls required by the EU.  These savings reflect changes in my Department&rsquo;s work practices, improved business processes, the greater use of computerisation and the wind up of livestock offices and takes account of the changes arising from CAP reform, the continued implementation of the Department&rsquo;s decentralisation plan, the findings of the organisational review programme and the objectives set out in the Government&rsquo;s transforming public services programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Internal reviews of my Department&rsquo;s operations have highlighted changes in the workload of the local office network arising from significant decreases in the incidence of animal diseases; CAP reform giving rise to changes in the delivery of schemes and services; investment in information technology, especially in the areas of animal health and welfare, customer management, animal movement identification and the management of field inspections; adjustments to schemes and programmes; reduced footfall in local offices; and advances in the broader areas of transport and communications.</P>
        <P>Bearing these changes in mind the aim of the local office network reorganisation is to rationalise the overall number of locations across the country to facilitate the more efficient management of schemes, services and disease levels.  Providing satellite agriculture offices on any basis outside of the 16 new regional offices does not feature in the reorganisation process.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the 16 chosen locations for the new regional offices will provide an improved customer service in all regions of the country while at the same time reducing the cost of delivering the services provided for the Department&rsquo;s many customers and stakeholders.  In addition, the new regional structure will facilitate the retention of the appropriate number of staff required in each location, while at the same time maintaining a very high quality of services across the country.</P><Col N="708"/>
        <P>This decision, when fully implemented, will result in financial savings in the Department&rsquo;s running costs of some &euro;30 million annually, and the reduction of over 400 staff.  By rationalising our local office network we can improve services to our clients by concentrating the remaining staff resources of approximately 1,000 people at the newly developed centres.  This initiative is part of a continual process of modernisation of the Department.  The various staff associations have been consulted in relation to the redeployment of staff within the Department and to other Departments.</P>
        <P>I wish to express my appreciation to the staff in our local offices for their contribution to the work of the Department over the years and to their continued commitment to providing a quality service to our stakeholders.  I would also like to assure this House and our key stakeholders of my continued commitment to providing an exemplary support service across all areas of Departmental activities and I strongly believe that this will be best delivered through the new regional office structure now being implemented.</P>

        <Quest> if the policy of curtailing performance bonuses in all financial institutions covered under the Government guarantee, as outlined in section 5.16 of the Covered Institutions Remuneration Oversight Committee report, is being adhered to; if he will confirm that no bonuses have been sanctioned in 2009 or to date in 2010; if he will further confirm that he does not propose to sanction any bonuses in these institutions while the Government guarantee is in place, as recommended by CIROC; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[25643/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Covered Institutions Remuneration Oversight Committee (CIROC), which was set up under the terms of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme, reported to me on 27 February 2009.  Its remit was to oversee all remuneration plans of senior executives of the covered institutions. For this purpose, remuneration included total salary, bonuses, pension payments and any other benefits received from a covered institution and its group entities, or otherwise received by a director or executive arising from the performance of his or her functions as a director or executive. </P>
        <P>Specifically regarding bonuses at section 5.15 of its Report, CIROC recommended that no performance-related bonus awards should be made to chief executives and executive directors for 2008 or 2009 and for the period of the Government guarantee.</P>
        <P>I wrote to the chairpersons of each of the covered institutions on foot of the publication of the CIROC report seeking immediate action from the Boards to revise remuneration plans, which included the recommendations on bonuses. These recommendations were then to be incorporated in revised remuneration plans of the covered institutions to reflect compliance with the Act. The responsibility for ensuring that the recommendations of CIROC are implemented is a matter for the individual covered institutions and, in particular, their respective remuneration committees.</P>
        <P>It can be seen from the publication of the respective 2009 financial statements of the covered institutions that the recommendations of CIROC regarding executive bonuses are been <Col N="710"/>implemented. There has been no change in Government policy on this issue and the prohibition of the payment of performance awards to senior executives continues in force.</P>
        <P>The financial landscape of the covered institutions has changed considerably since February 2009.  The State now has taken effective control or made substantial investment in 5 of the covered institutions and all of the covered institutions continue to obtain the advantage and benefits of the Government Guarantee. This effectively means that through the terms of the respective subscription agreements and/or relationship frameworks the Government has implemented further controls on remuneration policy, including performance awards for senior executive, at the respective covered institutions beyond the provisions of CIROC.</P>
        <P>I should point out that performance awards in respect of previous years for some senior executives have been paid on the basis that a legal entitlement in accordance with employment conditions existed.  Also, a small number of bonus awards to other cadres of employees, below senior executive level, at respective covered institutions have been made, and will continue to be made, due to particular circumstances.  For example, I authorised payment of performance awards to some call centre staff where the award was an integral feature of their overall remuneration.  In other cases, on the basis of legal advice, that pre-existing contractual rights had been established to bonus awards approval has been provided &mdash; and I stress only on this basis &mdash; to allow these liabilities to be met.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the EU Commission&rsquo;s Communication on Bank Resolution Funds, published on 26 May 2010; if and when he intends to introduce legislation providing for a bank resolution mechanism or living will for insolvent banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>In my dealing with the banks I have clearly maintained the principle that the banks will contribute to the cost of State&rsquo;s support &mdash; the banks have been charged for the Government&rsquo;s guarantee of their liabilities and the NAMA Act provides for a levy on the banks should NAMA result in a loss for the taxpayer. In the context of the enhancement of supervision and the restructuring of the banking sector underway in Ireland, due consideration is of course being given to maintaining this principle, ensuring that the sector contributes its appropriate share, minimising as much as possible taxpayers&rsquo; exposure to potential costs arising from State support of the banking sector. </P>
        <P>One possible mechanism for ensuring that the financial sector bears these costs is set out in the European Commission&rsquo;s recent Communication on Bank Resolution Funds. The Commission&rsquo;s Communication supports the establishment of ex ante resolution funds, funded by a levy on the banks to facilitate the managed failure of ailing banks in an orderly manner. The Communication noted the importance of linkages between any resolution fund and a special resolution regime &mdash; suggesting that a resolution fund should form part of the toolbox of measures available to Member States in an EU crisis management framework for resolving institutions in difficulty.</P>
        <P>I have indicated previously that I am examining options for the introduction of a legislative regime to deal in a systematic way with distressed financial institutions, to ensure the State has in place a range of tools to address problem institutions effectively in the interests of maintaining financial stability, minimising reliance on public moneys and ensuring continuity of key banking activities.</P>
        <P>In view of the central role performed by central banks in resolution frameworks for financial institutions my Department is in consultation with the Central Bank and the Financial Regu<Col N="711"/>lator with a view to the development of draft legislative proposals, which I will consider in due course.</P>
        <P>Work is also underway at the EU level in this area, and the Commission is expected to bring forward legislative proposals on the use of resolution frameworks for cross border institutions in early 2011. Included in the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for discussion are additional powers for supervisors to require the preparation by systemically important institutions of firm-specific contingency and resolution plans. Ireland is, of course, participating fully in the work at EU level to examine this and other possible elements of bank resolution tool-kits in a cross-border context.</P>

	<P>Given the scale of our economic and financial difficulties, debate on the economy and the financial system has naturally dominated proceedings in the D&aacute;il over the past two years.  This week alone, the debate on the confidence motion was essentially a debate on the Government&rsquo;s economic policy. </P>
        <P>The arrangement of a debate such as the Deputy suggests in his question is a matter for the party whips. If the D&aacute;il Schedule allows it, I would have no difficulty with such a debate. Indeed, I would be particularly interested to hear the Deputy&rsquo;s proposals for stabilising the public finances so as to restore domestic and international confidence in our economy; regaining competitiveness to create jobs; and repairing our banking system to provide credit for viable businesses.</P>
        <P>These are the key pillars of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to return our economy to a sustainable growth path.</P>
        <P>Most of the latest data suggest that the economy is stabilising and many commentators now expect growth to resume in the second half of this year.  So the measures we have taken are beginning to bear fruit. We cannot be complacent, however. We still have many challenges ahead, particularly in relation to the public finances so that we can reduce the General Government Deficit below 3 per cent by end 2014.</P>
        <P>We also continue to advance our strategy to repair the banking system. A key objective of recent Government actions in relation to the stabilisation of the financial sector has been the promotion of a stable and active banking system which supports the real economy. At a fundamental level the banking system is at the very core of a functioning economy and needs to be maintained in the interests of the economy and society at large.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s entire economic strategy is ultimately about creating sustainable jobs.  We are working to position Ireland as a global innovation hub &mdash; the best place for both multinational and Irish companies to start, grow and transform. These initiatives introduced by this Government will lay the foundations for future employment growth. We are also developing opportunities in the green economy, renewable energy and clean technology.</P>
        <P>A key component of the Government&rsquo;s jobs strategy is to regain our competitive position which is critical to our future economic prospects. Our economy is flexible and resilient. Price levels and wages &mdash; including those for the public service &mdash; are all adjusting rapidly to the new circumstances and are contributing to an improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness. We have also made significant investment in areas such as productive infrastructure which will <Col N="712"/>enhance our competitiveness and capacity to grow. A high level of capital investment in critical infrastructure is being maintained which will help support the economy and jobs. </P>

	<P>The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts, 2009 under which the pension related deduction and pay reductions were applied to public servants make provision for a review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of both Acts before 30 June 2011. In addition to the criteria set out in the Acts, the Public Service Agreement, which has now been ratified by the Public Service Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, provides that the reviews will take account of sustainable savings generated from the implementation of the Agreement in the public service. Those savings will be independently verified by an Implementation Body which is provided for under the Agreement. A report of the findings of the reviews must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The Implementation Body provided for under the Agreement will oversee progress on the implementation of the agreed transformation measures across the Public Service with a view to achieving early, sustainable and verifiable outcomes to the process. The Body will comprise an independent chair with 3 nominees each from Public Service Management and the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions respectively. The Government will engage immediately with the Public Services Committee to finalise arrangements for the implementation of the Agreement.</P>
        <P>The sectoral agreements which form part of the overall Agreement set out a clear agenda for change within each sector. The measures provided for vary across each sector and it is not possible at this point to be prescriptive as to what measures of progress will be adopted in each case by the Implementation Body.</P>
        <P>The Government is determined that public service management will be proactive and ambitious in delivering on the full range of productivity and change measures envisaged in the Agreement, and accepted as necessary by all parties to it.  Strong oversight by the Implementation Body will be an important factor in this.</P>

	<P>The transfer of the first tranche of loans, totalling &euro;15.3 billion in loan balances, from the five participating institutions concluded on 31 May 2010. NAMA issued bonds to a value of &euro;7.7 billion to the institutions, of which 5% are subordinated securities. The senior bonds mature in March 2011 and are extendible at the option of NAMA. They are Government-guaranteed Floating Rate Notes and pay interest at a rate of 6 month Euribor or 6 month GBP Libor. The subordinated bonds are callable perpetual fixed rate bonds which may be redeemed from March 2020 onwards. Interest is payable annually on the subordinated bonds if NAMA is considered to be achieving its objectives.</P>
        <P>NAMA expects to acquire some &euro;81 billion in loans from the five participating institutions by February 2011. It is not possible as yet to estimate the amount of bonds that will be issued as consideration for these loans given that a very thorough due diligence process must take place before the final acquisition values have been determined.</P>

	<P>The Irish public finances, in particular tax receipts, have been very severely impacted by the sharp deterioration in our economy. Tax revenue in 2010 is expected to be in the region of &euro;31 billion, a decline of nearly 35 per cent on the level of taxes received in 2007. The Government recognised early on that the gap that had emerged between revenues and expenditure was not sustainable. A multi-annual framework has been put in place to restore stability to the public finances and to reduce the General Government Deficit to below the 3 per cent of GDP Stability and Growth Pact limit by 2014. The European Commission, the ECB, the IMF, the OECD and respected international economic commentators are amongst those who have welcomed the plan. </P>
        <P>The Government has already implemented significant measures to restore order to the public finances over the past two years. Beginning in July 2008, revenue raising and expenditure reducing measures designed to yield some &euro;8 billion or 5 per cent of GDP in 2009 were intro<Col N="715"/>duced. In addition, Budget 2010 delivered further expenditure adjustments amounting to &euro;4 billion or 2&frac12; per cent of GDP.</P>
        <P>As a result of the significant corrective action taken, Budget 2010 forecast the stabilisation of the underlying deficit in 2010, notwithstanding declining economic activity. Encouragingly, there are now signs that economic conditions are stabilising and positive growth is expected in the second half of the year. The latest Exchequer figures, for the period to end-May 2010, show that the budgetary plan is on target. Recent international developments highlight the importance of continuing along the path of fiscal consolidation and, while substantial progress has already been made, further measures will be required in the years out to 2014 in order to keep the corrective process on track.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s focus now is on securing the necessary adjustments for Budget 2011 and work is underway in that regard. In terms of the amount involved, &euro;3 billion was set out in Budget 2010 as the necessary adjustment for 2011. &euro;1 billion of that is to come from the capital expenditure side. The balance of &euro;2 billion will come from the current side of the Budget and will be a mix of expenditure and taxation measures. The precise breakdown of this adjustment is a matter for ongoing determination in the context of my formulation of Budget 2011 and at this stage of the year I do not intend to comment on the specifics of the 2011 Budget. </P>

        <P>The transfer of the first tranche of loans, totalling &euro;15.3 billion in loan balances, from the five participating institutions concluded on 31 May 2010. NAMA issued bonds to a value of &euro;7.7 billion to the institutions, of which 95% was senior debt and 5% was in the form of subordinated securities.</P>
        <P>The Chairman of NAMA recently stated that a weighted-average LEV (long-term economic value) uplift of 11% was applied to the current market value of property underlying loans which were acquired as part of the first tranche.  The first tranche weighted average uplift for loans was about 28%. The differential between the CMV and the LEV for loans is greater than that for property because the value for loans is dependent not just on the value of the property but also on the cash flows on the loans and the discount rate applicable to those cash flows and many of these loans have little or no cash flow.</P>
        <P>Section 55 of the NAMA Act 2009 provides that NAMA will submit reports to the Minister for Finance every three months and that these will then be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  These reports are to include information on NAMA borrowings and bond issues. </P>

        <Quest> his views on the most recent monthly Private Sector Credit Statistics published by the Central Bank; his views on whether the decline in household and commercial debt is a function of weak demand for credit or weak supply of credit; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Private sector credit growth and debt levels are monitored by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and details are published by the Bank in their monthly and quarterly bulletins.  The most recent monthly statistics were published on 31 May 2010 with figures to the end of April 2010.</P>
        <P>These showed the headline level of private sector credit outstanding to be &euro;352.8 billion at the end of April 2010. This is a 12.7 per cent decline in the stock of private sector credit since the peak level of &euro;403.9 billion in November 2008. The annual rate of change was minus 9.3 per cent, following a similar decline in March and minus 8.9 per cent in February.  The decline reflects both valuation effects and repayments exceeding new lending.</P>
        <P>Survey evidence from the main credit providers suggests both reduced demand for credit and continued tightening of credit standards by lenders for business lending during the first quarter of 2010. Credit standards on loans to households tightened for both lending for house purchase and consumer loans during the first quarter of 2010 and this was attributed to increased risk perception.</P>
        <P>It is important from a policy perspective to ensure that viable businesses have access to credit. In this context, on 30 March I announced specific lending targets on the main business banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland.  They will make available for targeted lending not less than &euro;3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011.  The two banks have each submitted SME lending plans for 2010 and 2011 in light of the &euro;3 billion target.  These plans are being reviewed by my officials and Mr. John Trethowan, the Credit Reviewer.</P>
        <P>Additionally, the Deputy will be aware that the Credit Review Office is available to review banks&rsquo; decisions to refuse or withdraw credit to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It will provide an independent opinion of the banks&rsquo; decisions on whether the credit should have been granted or not. In addition to dealing with individual cases, the credit review system will examine the credit policies and practices of the banks in respect of SMEs. This will help me to decide what further action might be necessary to secure the flow of credit. I intend to publish the analysis from the review process so that the performance of the banks participating in NAMA will be clear to all.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that, under EU State-aid rules, financial institutions in receipt of State aid must submit restructuring plans to the European Commission. To-date, plans have been submitted to the Commission in respect of Anglo-Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and the EBS Building Society. A restructuring plan in respect of Irish Nationwide Building Society is due to be submitted to the EU in the near future. Irish Life and Permanent will also have to submit a viability plan to the Commission by 30 September, 2010. </P>
        <P>Pending the European Commission&rsquo;s final decisions on the various plans, it is not possible at this stage to be definitive as regards possible realignments or development of the domestic banking sector. Any decision on the future of the domestic banking sector will be subject to the approval of the European Commission in the context of the restructuring process. These decisions will also be informed by the views of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the NTMA. In that regard, the NTMA has been assigned responsibility to lead discussions, in consultation with my Department, with all interested parties on the restructuring of the financial system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In his report on the banking crisis Governor Honohan is very clear that an extensive guarantee needed to be put in place.  The Governor does raise some questions regarding the scope of the guarantee relating to existing longer-term senior bonds and dated subordinated debt.</P>
        <P>I have on a number of occasions discussed the question of the inclusion of dated subordinated debt in the guarantee and have been clear on the basis the decision was made.  This was, in particular, the requirement to maintain access to wholesale capital markets and guard against the risk of a default for any of these liabilities which could arise from the non-payment of either principal of interest that would have had the effect of triggering the entire guarantee.</P>
        <P>As far as opportunities for risk-sharing are concerned I understand that holders of subordinated debt in the three largest banks have suffered losses of more than &euro;5 billion so far.  In addition, credit rating agencies have downgraded subordinated debt in some of the Irish institutions on the basis that they expect further costs to be imposed on these bondholders.  I have consistently made clear that there is no question of the guarantee for existing dated subordinated debt being extended beyond 29 September 2010 next.</P>
        <P>Turning to the inclusion of the guarantee provided for existing senior debt on the 30 September 2008, it is not straightforward to assess what options were available for burden sharing and how that burden sharing could be achieved in practice.  Moreover, there were significant risks from excluding existing senior bonds from the guarantee which could have resulted in the guarantee being called on other guaranteed securities with severe consequences for financial stability overall.</P>
        <P>Apart from these issues, the fact remains that a comprehensive guarantee of bank liabilities was an established part of the standard toolkit for responding to systemic banking crises internationally.  Sweden, which is often regarded as the template for successfully dealing with its banking crisis, provided a blanket guarantee of bank liabilities in the 1990s.  In the current crisis Denmark, another small EU Member State, provided a very extensive guarantee including existing bonds early in October 2008.  The Deputy may wish to note that the UK authorities provided a broad guarantee to existing senior bondholders in Northern Rock.</P>
        <P>In overall terms as is evident from Governor Honohan&rsquo;s report, the guarantee preserved the stability of the entire banking system at a time that it was at serious risk of collapse.  In the circumstances of September / October 2008, with markets characterised in the Governor&rsquo;s Report as hysterical, it was essential that the commitment provided by the Irish Government to stand behind our banking system was entirely credible, clear and consistent.  In those circumstances, there were significant risks in an approach which sought to discriminate between differ<Col N="719"/>ent types of bank liabilities which resulted in the financial markets concluding that the guarantee was not market acceptable or indeed credible.</P>
        <P>Very significant volumes of both short-term and longer-term funding were secured by the banks from wholesale capital markets in the weeks following the introduction of the guarantee.  This has subsequently provided an important foundation to the funding of the banks and a bulwark against funding pressures that have arisen at various times since.</P>
        <P>I am, therefore, fully satisfied that the Government&rsquo;s Decision in this matter was at that time informed by a sufficiently broad range of advice on the formulation of the guarantee and it will be a priority for me to ensure that it remains the case that Government decision-making on returning our banking system to health is fully informed by expert advice from the Governor of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and indeed the NTMA to which I have delegated significant roles in relation to the restructuring of the banks.</P>

	<P>The Registrar of Credit Unions is responsible for the regulation and supervision of credit unions under the Credit Union Act 1997.  The Registrar&rsquo;s statutory role under the Act relates to the supervision and oversight of the financial position and activities of credit unions on an ongoing basis.  The Registrar reports to the Regulatory Authority in order to ensure that there is an early identification and response to any significant issues relating to the credit union movement or any individual credit union. </P><Col N="720"/>
        <P>As the Deputy will recognise, the current economic downturn is adversely affecting the loan books of all financial institutions.  Credit unions have withstood the financial crisis better than most financial institutions.  The Registrar of Credit Unions has, however, indicated a sharp rise in arrears levels in the sector and a significant increase in the levels of loans being rescheduled as more members come under financial stress.  The Registrar is working with individual credit unions to build reserves and provisions to strengthen their balance sheets and thereby protect members&rsquo; savings.   I am advised by the Registrar that there are around 20 credit unions with particularly high levels of arrears which the Registrar is monitoring closely due to regulatory concerns about the impact of high levels of arrears on their solvency positions.</P>
        <P>The challenge at this time is for credit unions to be sensible and prudent while continuing to assist their members as far as possible.  They should trust that the regulatory requirements and guidelines issued by the Registrar of Credit Unions are for their benefit and they should revert to the Registrar at an early stage should they encounter difficulties.  The Registrar has issued requirements, circulars and guidance notes to credit unions in an effort to build a sector with adequate reserves and liquidity, with sensible and prudent credit policies and accounting practices that ensure a true and fair view of the books of the credit union is presented.  Many credit unions are operated by non-professionals and volunteers and it is most important that the guidelines issued are followed and that the Registrar is consulted if there are any difficulties in this regard.  The Registrar will assist any credit union in working through their difficulties over time.</P>
        <P>I am examining options for the introduction of a legislative regime to deal in a systematic way with distressed financial institutions, to ensure the State has in place a range of tools to address problem institutions effectively in the interests of maintaining financial stability, minimising reliance on public moneys and ensuring continuity of key banking activities. In the context of work underway by my Department and the Central Bank in this area the appropriate treatment of Credit Unions is under consideration.</P>

	<P>The European Council has taken a number of steps in recent weeks and months to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area. There is also a broad understanding that economic governance within the euro area needs to be improved. The Commission recently issued a Communication (2010) 250 on reinforcing economic policy coordination. The President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy has established a Task Force to look more closely at reform and is considering many of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals.</P>
        <P>The Task Force &mdash; of which I am a member &mdash; has met twice already and is looking at a number of issues, including a crisis resolution mechanism for the euro area, addressing macroeconomic imbalances, reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact and enhanced budgetary coordination. In discussing these issues, a general view is emerging that all avenues for improvements that could be advanced quickly should be considered, while taking account of national budgetary procedures and the role of national parliaments. The President will provide an interim oral report to the European Council today, Thursday 17 June. A final report will be made to the European Council in October.   I look forward to further engagement with this important process.</P><Col N="721"/>
        <P>In relation to the European stabilisation fund, in the wake of the crisis in Greece, the Ecofin Council decided at an Extraordinary meeting on 9 May 2010 to establish a comprehensive package of measures in order, if needed, to financially support Member States in difficulties caused by exceptional circumstances beyond their control and to safeguard financial stability in Europe.</P>
        <P>The support measures which amount in total to &euro;750bn consist of:</P>
        <P>The <b>European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM)</b> based on Article 122 of the Treaty providing up to &euro;60 billion in loans or credit lines which could be very rapidly mobilised, if needed. The Regulation setting up the EFSM has already been enacted by the Ecofin Council. The Mechanism will be administered by the Commission and be guaranteed by Member States through the EU Budget.</P>
        <P>The <b>European Financial Stability Facility, </b>an inter-governmental agreement by euro area Member States to provide up to &euro;440 billion in additional loans or credit lines, if required, via a special purpose vehicle (SPV).   Member states would guarantee the funding raised by the SPV to finance loans under the Facility.  Guarantees issued by Member States would be in the same proportion as their ECB capital shares, similar to the case of the Euro Area Loan Facility for Greece.   Ireland&rsquo;s share of the guarantees would amount to just over &euro;7bn.</P>
        <P>The funding costs including principal and interest repayment will be the responsibility of the beneficiary member state. Financial assistance is in all cases to be subject to strong policy conditionality.</P>
        <P>The IMF have also committed to provide up to a maximum of &euro;250 billion in loans to euro area Member States on a country by country basis, in the manner that the IMF recently agreed a package with the Greek Government.</P>
        <P>I welcome all of these measures.  They are important for the EU, the euro area and for Ireland.  Their overriding purpose is to safeguard financial stability.  Legislation is required to provide for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the European Financial Stability Facility.</P>
        <P>On 25 May 2010 the Government approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation, along with other euro area Member States, in the intergovernmental agreement setting up a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), a necessary step in creating the Facility.  The Government also agreed to the issuing of guarantees associated with the SPV, if needed, on a joint and pro-rata basis with the other shareholders in the SPV.</P>
        <P>The SPV which will raise funds, if needed, to provide loans to beneficiary Member States was established on 7 June 2010 as a limited liability company under Luxembourg law (Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme) and it will be known as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).  At present Luxembourg is the only shareholder but shares will be distributed in due course to all Euro Area Member States including Ireland.</P>
        <P>On 15 June 2010, the Government approved the publication of the European Financial Stability Facility Bill 2010 and subject to agreement with the Whips Office, I propose to introduce it in the D&aacute;il towards the end of next week.   The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Facility and to issue guarantees, if required, subject to the terms of the related Framework Agreement which I signed last week.  The Agreement, which will be scheduled to the Bill, sets out the parameters for the Facility and the relationships between the participating Member States.  The Articles of Association for the SPV will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas at the same time as the Bill.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s strategy for change in the Public Service is set out in its statement, <i>Transforming Public Services</i>.   <i>Transforming Public Services </i>built on the recommendations of the OECD Review of the Irish Public Service and report of the Task Force on the Public Service.  Its overall theme is a more integrated Public Service having greater connectivity and linkages across Departments and agencies to deliver an improved level of performance for customers together with greater connectivity.  The Transformation agenda is being headed by a Cabinet Committee chaired by the Taoiseach, and Minister of State Calleary has been given responsibility for driving the Transformation Agenda.</P>
        <P><i>Transforming Public Services</i> puts the citizen and the delivery of front line services at the centre of our public services.  It presents a blueprint for a cohesive Public Service, focused on common goals, with greater co-operation and reduced boundaries between sectors, organisations and professions. The focus is on a much greater integration of services around user needs and far greater efficiency in internal data sharing and administration through shared service models aimed at achieving significant savings.  <i>Transforming Public Services</i> also envisages a more flexible labour market and talent pool with a facility to redeploy staff across sectoral boundaries to areas of greatest priority.</P>
        <P>The Croke Park Agreement provides a shared vision of how the Transformation agenda will be implemented.  Like <i>Transforming Public Services</i>, the Agreement recognises that a more integrated Public Service that is leaner, more effective and more focused on the needs of the citizen is required to contribute to the process of returning Ireland to economic growth and prosperity.  In the context of reduced numbers and resources, the Public Service will be reorganised and Public Servants will show greater flexibility and mobility in working across traditional boundaries.</P>

	<P>Under EU State aid requirements the financial institutions which were recapitalised by the State; Allied Irish Banks, Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, were obliged to submit restructuring plans to the European Commission within six-months of receiving Government assistance. The Bank of Ireland Plan was submitted to the Commission on 30 September 2009, the Allied Irish Banks Plan was submitted on 13 November 2009, and the Anglo Irish Bank Plan was submitted on 30 November 2009.</P>
        <P>Considerable discussion, dialogue and exchange of information is continuing in respect of the restructuring plans that have already been submitted as the Commission undertake their assessment of the plans in line with the applicable state aid rules. Negotiations in respect of the Bank of Ireland plan are at an advanced stage, and a decision is expected from the European Commission by mid-2010. AIB has adjusted the content of its plan to reflect the new capital requirements announced by the Financial Regulator in March, while Anglo Irish Bank, on foot of a request by the Commission, submitted a revised plan on 31 May 2010. It is too early to assess when final approval of the restructuring plans for these institutions will be granted by the Commission.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 46 together.</P>
        <P>As I emphasised in my Banking Statement on 30 March, finding a long-term solution for Anglo Irish Bank is by far the biggest challenge in resolving the banking crisis.  The sheer size of the bank means there are no easy or low cost options.</P>
        <P>As set out in the statement the bank&rsquo;s new management and board have estimated, an immediate wind-up would lead to a fire-sale of assets resulting in a permanent additional and unnecessary loss of upwards of &euro;30 billion.  In addition, the State would have to provide a large sum of cash &mdash; in the order of &euro;70 billion &mdash; up-front to meet the deposits, bondholders and the liabilities due to the Eurosystem.</P>
        <P>This assessment carried out by the bank in the context of the preparation of its restructuring plan makes clear that a longer term wind-down is not in the taxpayers&rsquo; interest.  In addition to the capital losses that would be sustained, a long-term wind-down of the bank over ten years could expose the State to funding obligations approaching &euro;30 billion.</P>
        <P>The realisation of the costs involved under these scenarios and the wider disruption to the financial system would generate enormous instability for the State with unforeseeable but potentially long-lasting damage to the overall economy.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the bank&rsquo;s revised restructuring plan prepared by its new senior management team was submitted to the European Commission at the end of May.  Following a very comprehensive and detailed evaluation of strategic restructuring options, the bank has identified as its preferred option, in terms of minimizing the future cost to the taxpayer, to carve out a smaller and stronger bank, leaving the remainder in the form of an asset management and recovery company.  It is envisaged that the new going concern entity would be prepared for sale in due course.  This option holds out the prospect of reducing the impact on the taxpayer and yielding some value in the future when the bank is sold out of State hands.</P>
        <P>The Chair and the CEO of the bank provided further details on the bank&rsquo;s restructuring plan and the various options presented in the plan at their appearance at the Finance and Public Service Committee yesterday.  As the plan remains under consideration by the European Commission and in light of the commercial sensitivity of much of the information contained in the plan, it is not possible to present full details of the costs of maintaining the bank as a going concern as compared to the orderly wind down of the bank.</P>
        <P>As I have consistently reiterated, the sums required to rescue the bank are enormous but the costs of winding it down are even greater.  The current bank strategy of seeking to devise a way to realise value for the taxpayer out of the remains of the old bank means the State could at least get some return, in time, recouping some of its assistance.</P>

	<P>The Government has a multi-annual plan to restore order to the public finances by reducing the General Government deficit to below 3 <Col N="725"/>per cent of GDP by 2014.  Budget 2010 was the latest phase in that plan, delivering corrective measures totalling &euro;4 billion, the majority of which were on the spending side.  The end-May Exchequer Returns are broadly in line with our budgetary targets and the Budget targets for the year as a whole remain valid.  My Department will assess the position further in light of the end-June Exchequer Returns.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s budget strategy has been welcomed, by the European Commission amongst others, and has earned Ireland significant credibility, something of immense importance given developments internationally in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s focus now is on securing the necessary adjustments for Budget 2011 and work is under way in that regard.  In terms of the amount involved, &euro;3 billion was set out in Budget 2010 as the necessary adjustment for 2011.  &euro;1 billion of that is to come from the capital expenditure side.  The balance of &euro;2 billion will come from the current side of the Budget and will be a mix of expenditure and taxation measures.  The precise breakdown of this adjustment is a matter for ongoing determination in the context of my formulation of Budget 2011 and at this stage of the year I do not intend to comment on the specifics of the 2011 Budget.</P>

        <Quest> if the EUROSTAT classification of the recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank in 2009 has implications for the projected general deficit in 2010 and later years; and if the EU Commission has confirmed that the existing deficit correction over the period to 2014 is still acceptable under the eurozone obligations. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Initially the Irish authorities, with regard to Eurostat guidelines, classified the investment of &euro;4bn by the Government in Anglo Irish Bank in 2009 as a financial transaction and, as such, it did not affect the general government balance.  However, since then the Irish authorities have reviewed the matter in light of later information and concluded that the transaction should be considered a capital injection rather than a financial transaction.  In the course of making the Maastricht returns this information was relayed to Eurostat.</P>
        <P>This resulted in the general government deficit being re-calculated to be 14.3% of GDP.  The underlying General Government Balance excluding this technical reclassification is 11.8% of GDP, which is broadly in line with the Budget day estimate.</P>
        <P>This reclassification is a once-off adjustment that only impacts on 2009 and does not affect the forecast for a General Government Balance of around 11 &frac12; % of GDP for 2010, nor does it impact on later years.</P>
        <P>In April of this year the EU Commission issued its opinion on Ireland&rsquo;s Stability Programme Update.  This, along with the other Member States programmes, was considered at Ecofin.  Our Programme, which sets out our plan to have a General Government deficit below 3% of GDP by 2014, was welcomed.  The Ecofin Council endorsed the substantial consolidation measures which we have undertaken and called on us to rigorously implement the budget for 2010.</P>
        <P>Therefore, the target of 2014 to reduce the general government deficit below 3% of GDP remains valid.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, since 29 September 2008, the State has guaranteed certain liabilities of credit institutions in Ireland initially under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme (the &lsquo;CIFS&rsquo; Scheme) but more recently under the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme (the &lsquo;ELG&rsquo; Scheme).</P>
        <P>The Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) Scheme, which commenced on 9 December 2009 following Oireachtas and EU State aid approval introduced important changes to the Guarantee for financial institutions bringing it more into line with the mainstream approach to similar guarantees in other EU Member States.</P>
        <P>The ELG Scheme is intended to facilitate the ability of credit institutions in Ireland to issue debt securities and take term deposits with a maturity post-September 2010 of up to five years, on either a guaranteed or unguaranteed basis.</P>
        <P>The ECB pricing recommendations on government guarantees for bank debt apply to liabilities guaranteed under the ELG Scheme.  This is the standard pricing arrangements which now applies to all Guarantee schemes securing approval of the European Commission in line with the applicable State aid rules.  The exact remuneration payable to the State is dependent on a range of factors such as the maturity profile of the liabilities and the extent to which institutions chose to make unguaranteed issuances, however the fee will be charged at a higher rate than under CIFS.  The average fee for short-term bank debt now stands at 0.5% under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>The yield to the Exchequer in respect of guarantee fees as remuneration from the institutions for the availability of the State Guarantee is expected to amount to at least &euro;1 billion over two years from September 2008.  To date &euro;718 million in respect of the CIFS scheme and &euro;90.5m in respect of the ELG scheme has been collected from the covered institutions.</P>
        <P>The fees charged to guaranteed institutions have been approved by the European Commission and help ensure the compatibility of the guarantee schemes with EC state aid requirements.  Other than in relation to the payment of these fees by the institutions participating in the guarantee schemes the issue of recouping the state aid provided under the schemes does not arise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 64 and 69 together.</P>
        <P>On 30 March 2009, I directed the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to invest &euro;3.5 billion in preference shares issued by Bank of Ireland and on 12 May 2009 I directed the Commission to invest &euro;3.5 billion in preference shares issued by Allied Irish Banks plc (AIB).  I gave these directions under the Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009 (&ldquo;the 2009 Act&rdquo;), having consulted the Governor of the Central Bank and the Regulatory Authority and having decided that the investments were required in the public interest to prevent potential serious damage to the financial system in the State and to ensure the continued stability of that system.</P>
        <P>These investments were in perpetual preference shares with an annual non-cumulative fixed dividend of 8% payable in cash or, in the case of non-payment by either bank of the cash dividend, ordinary shares in lieu.  The preference shares could be repurchased at par up to the fifth anniversary of the issue and at 125% of face value thereafter.  Warrants issued with, but detachable from, the preference shares gave an option to purchase up to 25% of the enlarged ordinary share capital of each bank (following exercise of the warrants).  The warrants were exercisable at any time from the fifth to tenth anniversary of issue of the preference shares or immediately prior to any takeover or merger of the bank concerned, whichever is earlier.  The number of ordinary shares which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the warrants was subject to anti-dilution protection in line with market norms for warrants.  Accordingly, the warrants will be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of ordinary shares in issue resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of units of ordinary shares.  The warrants will also be proportionately adjusted for any capital distributions by the bank and for certain bonus issues or rights issues by the bank.</P>
        <P>In February and May 2010, the Fund received ordinary shares in Bank of Ireland and AIB in lieu of cash as payment of the first dividend on its preference share investments.  The payment was made in the form of ordinary shares as the European Commission has requested that discretionary coupon payments on Tier 1 and Upper Tier 2 capital instruments in Bank of Ireland and AIB not be paid while it considers each bank&rsquo;s restructuring plan.  The number of shares issued in each case represents the amount of the annual preference share dividend divided by the average share price in the 30 trading days prior to the date of issue.</P>
        <P>On 30 March 2010 I gave details to the House of the further capital needs of the banks in order to meet the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s requirement of a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8%, of which 7% must be equity.</P>
        <P>As regards Bank of Ireland, on 25 April 2010, again having consulted the Governor of the Central Bank and the Regulatory Authority and, having decided that it was required in the public interest to prevent potential serious damage to the financial system in the State and to ensure the continued stability of that system, I issued directions to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission under the 2009 Act to convert part of its &euro;3.5 billion holding of Bank of Ireland preference stock into ordinary stock as part of the capital raising exercise announced by the bank on 26 April.  The details of the transaction are as follows:</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Placing/ Conversion (Step 1)</i></P>
        <P el="0">The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) subscribed for 576 million units of ordinary stock.  In exchange for this stock the NPRF converted 1,036 million units of preference stock at their issue price of &euro;1.00 into ordinary stock.</P><Col N="728"/>

        <P><i>Warrant cancellation</i></P>
        <P el="0">The NPRF received &euro;491 million in cash in return for the cancellation of the warrants issued in conjunction with the preference stock.</P>

        <P el="10"><i>Rights Issue (Step 2)</i></P>
        <P el="0">The NPRF participated in the Bank of Ireland rights issue taking up the full allocation to which it is entitled at a price of &euro;0.55 per unit of ordinary stock.  In order to exercise the rights, the NPRF converted a further 627 million units of its preference stock into ordinary stock.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Fees</i></P>
        <P el="0">The NPRF received &euro;52 million in fees for its participation in the transaction.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Change in dividend rate on preference stock</i></P>
        <P el="0">The dividend rate on the remaining preference stock increases from 8.00% to 10.25%.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The transaction involved no new investment by the NPRF in Bank of Ireland and was funded entirely via conversion of preference stock.  Including the cancellation of the warrants issued in conjunction with the preference stock and fees, the NPRF has received total cash income of &euro;543 million from Bank of Ireland for participation in the transaction.</P>
        <P>The NPRF&rsquo;s directed investment in Bank of Ireland now consists of:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />1,900 million units of ordinary stock valued at their current market price (36% of the bank&rsquo;s ordinary stock in issue); and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />1,837 million units of preference stock held at their issue price of &euro;1.00 paying an annual dividend of 10.25%.</P>
        <P>As regards AIB, the NPRF&rsquo;s directed investment in AIB now consists of:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />3,500 million units of preference shares held at their issue price of &euro;1.00 paying an annual dividend of 8.00%;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />198 million ordinary shares valued at their current market price (18% of the bank&rsquo;s ordinary stock in issue)</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In my statement to the House on 30 March, I said that the Regulator had determined that AIB must raise additional equity capital of at least &euro;7.4 billion by the end of the year to meet the new base case capital standards and that, as the first step in meeting its capital needs, AIB would immediately commence the process of sale of overseas assets.  The disposal proceeds will provide significant capital but may not be sufficient to address the full requirement.  To the extent that the gap is not filled by the private sector, the State is willing to convert some or all of its preference shares as required on terms to be agreed that will provide full value for the State.  Depending on the structure of the capital raising and the extent of private participation, no new Exchequer funding may be required.  But if additional money is required, it will be provided by way of ordinary equity. Any additional capital requirement will be met from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</P>
        <P>The NPRF Commission will continue to publish information on the overall return on and value of the investments it holds in credit institutions at my direction in its quarterly Performance and Portfolio Updates.</P><Col N="729"/>
        <P>As regards the treatment of changes in the value of the NPRF, the contribution of the NPRF to the General Government Balance is made up of the interest and dividends which it earns on its investments, less any costs associated with the administration of the fund.  Any changes in the nominal values of investments held by the NPRF are not considered to be income or expenditure, as they affect the value of the stock of NPRF assets and do not have an impact on the General Government Balance.  The payment to Government of ordinary shares in lieu of a dividend is considered as income in national accounting terms and, therefore, improves the General Government Balance by the same amount as if the Fund had received the dividend payment.</P>

	<P>Consideration of how to ensure that the financial sector contributes to the cost of dealing with crises is under way in various fora internationally.  In addition to the Communication from the European Commission referred to by the Deputy, the IMF is also examining this issue, at the request of the G20 and is due to present its final report to the G20 summit later this month.  The Communiqu&eacute; from the recent G20 Finance Ministers meeting on 5 June 2010 in Busan recognised that there is a range of policy approaches, and agreed to the development of principles reflecting the need to protect taxpayers, reduce risks from the financial system, protect the flow of credit in good times and bad, taking into account individual country&rsquo;s circumstances and options, and helping promote level playing field.</P>
        <P>One possible mechanism for ensuring that the financial sector bears the costs is a bank levy, as set out in the Commission&rsquo;s Communication on Bank Resolution Funds.  The Commission&rsquo;s Communication supports the establishment of ex ante resolution funds, funded by a levy on the banks to facilitate the managed failure of ailing banks in an orderly manner and suggests that a resolution fund should form part of the toolbox of measures available to Member States in an EU crisis management framework.  It is important to note that an objective of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, in conjunction with its wider proposals on a crisis management system, is to mitigate the burden on the taxpayer arising from financial crises.  As acknowledged in the Commission Communication, it would be difficult at present to initiate a single pan European resolution fund.</P>
        <P>In my dealing with the banks I have clearly maintained the principle that the banks will contribute to the cost of State&rsquo;s support &mdash; the banks have been charged for the Government&rsquo;s guarantee of their liabilities and the NAMA Act provides for a levy on the banks should NAMA result in a loss for the taxpayer.  In the context of the enhancement of supervision and the restructuring of the banking sector under way in Ireland it is my intention to ensure that the sector contributes its appropriate share, thereby minimising as much as possible taxpayers&rsquo; exposure to potential costs arising from State support of the banking sector.</P>

	<P>Studies indicate that in smaller Member States, small and medium enterprises tend to win a high percentage of public contracts.  EU studies indicate that about 65% of Ireland&rsquo;s public contracts, by value, is won by SMEs.  This compares to between 30% and 35% for bigger Member States such as the UK, France, Germany and Spain.  The figures relate to larger contracts advertised in the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU). Such contracts comprise between 25% and 30% of the total public procurement market.</P>
        <P>Smaller contracts, generally between &euro;50,000 and the OJEU publication threshold, are advertised on the national public procurement website (www.<i>etenders.gov.ie </i>) or, if of lower value, awarded following competition between an adequate number of suitable companies directly invited to tender.  Indicative figures show a very high proportion of this market segment is won by domestic enterprises.</P>
        <P>Government recognises the important business opportunities that public service contracts represent for business enterprises in the local and national economy and encourages participation to the greatest extent possible.  Significant measures have been introduced which make it easier for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to bid for public contracts.  Among these are:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the wide advertising of public procurement opportunities via the national public procurement website (<i>etenders</i>)<i> </i>which is now the established reference point for all procurement opportunities;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the issue of email &ldquo;alerts&rdquo; directly to registered suppliers when contracts that might be of interest to them are advertised;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /> the simplification of the tendering process through the <i>etenders</i> website having a facility to pre-qualify tenderers and to submit tenders online;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the provision of more training for the &ldquo;professionalisation&rdquo; of public purchasers.  In recent years, sixty officials from forty organisations have undergone training in spend profiling and corporate procurement planning.  A two year Masters qualification in Strategic Procurement is being offered by Dublin City University since September 2006 and an IPA Course is also available.  Such initiatives are providing key public purchasers with the skills to appropriately promote whole of Government objectives and policies through the State&rsquo;s purchasing power.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">More recently, the National Procurement Service (NPS) was established within the Office of Public Works.  The Service is working closely with all areas of the public sector to promote <Col N="732"/>efficiencies and economies in public procurement expenditure.  It is acutely aware of the issues for SMEs and has commenced the process of:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />encouraging organisations to advertise low value contracts on<i> etenders</i> in order to promote SME participation in association with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office (CSSO), standardising contract and tender documents;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />educating SMEs through up-skilling by means of seminars/workshops/website;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />in association with the Department of Finance, reviewing appropriate levels of financial capacity required for public contracts;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />working with the CSSO and the State Claims Agency in examining the levels of public liability insurance required;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />working with Enterprise Ireland to encourage SMEs to tender for as many public contracts as possible;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />encouraging SMEs in the use of electronic tendering on<i> etenders</i> which requires no more than a personal computer and Internet access and does not involve the expense of specialist software</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />encouraging early advertising upcoming procurement opportunities.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Finally, my Department, in consultation with the NPS, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and other stakeholders in the public procurement market, has developed guidance for contracting authorities on measures to facilitate SME participation in the public procurement market.  This will be published shortly.</P>

	<P>NAMA has a commercial remit and generating a return for the taxpayer is a key objective.  However, within this context NAMA will seek to facilitate public bodies seeking the creation of desirable developments that encourage vibrant sustainable communities.  I have previously indicated that such bodies could be given first option for a limited period on properties which NAMA has acquired.  Where it can be shown that providing units for social and affordable housing needs can create a commercial proposition for NAMA, then NAMA may play a role in the provision of social and affordable housing.  I understand that officials of NAMA have had some contact with officials of the Department of Environment Heritage and Local Government, local authorities and other public bodies to explore the scope for such arrangements.</P>

        <P>In mid-April 2010, the Office of Public Works (OPW) convened the first meeting of the Working Group set up to develop a structured and coherent approach to the further management and development of the site at Haulbowline.  The Terms of Reference for this Working Group are as follows:</P>
        <P el="5">1. to consult with the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces with regard to their future requirements for the site, and any security issues, which need to be considered;</P>

        <P el="5">3. to develop, following local consultation, a comprehensive list of possible future uses;</P>
        <P el="5">4. to assess the likely cost/benefit scenario for any likely proposal, and to ensure that the preferred option shows good value for money;</P>
        <P el="5">5. to endeavour to report to government within a six month timeframe.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is important to note that the Terms of Reference of the Working Group are confined to looking at possible future uses for Haulbowline Island.  The Terms of Reference do not include matters relating to contamination or matters relating to remediation or containment measures on the site.  Such matters will be considered in light of the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the recommendations of the Group as to the future use of the site.</P>

	<P>The Government agreed at its meeting on Wednesday 9 June that the preliminary reports, The Irish banking crisis: regulatory and financial stability policy 2003 &mdash; 2008, by the Governor of the Central Bank, and A preliminary <Col N="734"/>report on the sources of Ireland&rsquo;s banking crisis, by Klaus Regling and Max Watson, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>These reports are preliminary, scoping reports, which are intended to point the way to more detailed examination of specific issues by a statutory Commission of Investigation.  The Government has, in addition, published draft terms of reference for the Commission of Investigation, for consideration by the Oireachtas.  It is proposed that the final terms of reference be included in a Government Order to be voted on by both Houses of the Oireachtas before being signed by the Taoiseach.  It will be a matter for the Commission, when established, to investigate those issues set out in the terms of reference, in accordance with its powers under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 and, in this regard, I do not wish to pre-empt any findings the Commission may make.</P>
        <P>It might also be noted that the report by Messrs Regling and Watson distinguishes between issues that lend themselves to a formal process of investigation and issues that are, in general, less amenable to a legally-oriented process of investigation and may be more appropriate to policy review.</P>
        <P>The Government has published a draft terms of reference for a statutory Commission of Investigation having regard to the recommendations of both preliminary reports.  The Oireachtas will be invited to vote on a resolution approving a draft Government Order to establish a Commission in due course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, following a review of the Disabled Drivers scheme, some changes in the administrative arrangements have been gradually introduced to achieve efficiencies and to simplify the process for disabled claimants, so that claiming is easier and more customer-friendly.  The changes included dispensing with the submission of receipts with every fuel repayment claim and, more recently, moving to one claim per annum rather than up to 3 claims a year as had been the practice previously.</P>
        <P>The volume of fuel repayment claims had been very high.  During 2009, 29,410 claims were processed involving a total repayment of &euro;6.9 million.  The average repayment on each claim was therefore just &euro;234.  The reduction in the claim period from four monthly (max of 3 claims per annum) to one claim per annum was aimed at reducing the volume of paperwork being dealt with under the scheme and thereby achieving efficiencies.  The change will reduce the amount of claims being processed by at least half and allows for the provision of a more efficient and responsive service across all aspects of the Disabled Drivers schemes.  It is also in line with the generality of tax repayments.  In view of the low average value of claims, the change was considered feasible and should not cause undue difficulty for claimants.  In fact, the change has been welcomed by many claimants.</P>
        <P>Where particular difficulty is being experienced by a disabled claimant, Revenue will give favourable consideration to making an interim repayment, as an exception, on a case by case basis.</P>

He has a B. Comm degree, and is also a qualified accountant.  Finally, the Department has also engaged, on secondment from the Office of the Attorney General, a Senior Legal Advisor to the Department solely on financial services matters.

	<P>As indicated in my Banking Statement on 30 March 2010 Anglo Irish Bank will need further capital which could be of the order of &euro;10bn.  On 31 May 2010 an additional &euro;2bn in capital support was provided to Anglo Irish Bank.  This took place by way of an adjustment to the existing Promissory Note of &euro;8.3bn which issued to the Bank on the 31 March 2010.  This brings the total value of the Promissory Note to &euro;10.3bn.  As set out in my Banking Statement, it is clear that the bank will have a further capital requirement in 2010, which it is expected will be met by increasing the value of the Promissory Note.  The bank&rsquo;s assessment is that an additional capital requirement of approximately &euro;10bn is projected to arise in respect of the bank reflecting such factors as the need to cover additional capital requirements depending on the haircut on forthcoming transfer of assets to NAMA, the scale of the losses arising on the remainder of Anglo&rsquo;s loan book, and any capital costs arising under a restructuring of the bank.  As the Deputy will appreciate, EU State aid approval would be required as appropriate for any amount above that approved by the European Commission thus far.</P>

        <P>In the context of NAMA and the associated recapitalisations I sought further contributions to economic recovery from the banks.  In my statement on 30 March I announced further specific lending targets on the main business banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland.  They will make available for targeted lending not less than &euro;3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011.  The two banks have each submitted SME lending plans for 2010 and 2011 in light of the &euro;3 billion target.  These plans are being reviewed by my officials and Mr. John Trethowan, the Credit Reviewer and are the subject of ongoing discussions.  Banks are expected to make the credit available immediately and not to wait until the plans are finalised.  In the context of last year&rsquo;s recapitalisation, both my officials and the Financial Regulator receive quarterly reports in relation to the lending commitments made by AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The most recent report I have covers the first quarter of 2010 and it shows that AIB lent &euro;618m to SMEs while Bank of Ireland advanced &euro;582m.</P>

	<P>In accordance with EU State aid requirements, my officials formally notified the European Commission of the recapitalisation of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks on 11 March 2009 and 22 April 2009, respectively.  In both cases the Commission concluded that the measures in question constituted State aid pursuant to the relevant state aid articles of the EC Treaty. Consequently, both banks were required to submit restructuring plans to the European Commission within six-months of receiving Government assistance.  The Bank of Ireland Plan was submitted to the Commission on 30 September 2009 and the Allied Irish Banks Plan was submitted on 13 November 2009.  </P><Col N="737"/>

In the context of the six month review of the charge under the CIFS Scheme, which was undertaken by my Department in September 2009, and given the shortfall in monies raised from the charge to that date, the charge factor levied on each institution was reviewed and new, higher rates were applied over the remainder of the Scheme.  It remains my intention that &euro;1bn will be raised under CIFS and ELG by end September 2010 and it is expected that this target will be reached.</P>
        <P>I introduced a revised guarantee scheme, the ELG Scheme, in December 2009. Any new debt issued or new deposits taken after the date that participating institutions joined that scheme are guaranteed under ELG.  The formula for calculating the guarantee fees paid under ELG is based on European Central Bank recommendations on government guarantees for bank debt dated 20 October 2008, available at <i>http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/recommendations_ on_guaranteesen.pdf .  </i>In line with the ECB recommendations above, the fee structure is differentiated for institutions based on their credit ratings for liabilities with a maturity of greater than one year.  A flat rate fee of 50bp applies to all liabilities of less than or equal to one year.</P>
        <P>On the future arrangements for fees, the European Commission last month published a staff working document on the application of State Aid rules on Government Guarantee Schemes covering bank debt to be issued after 30 June 2010.  The pricing structure outlined in the document is being taken into account in ongoing discussions between the Department and the European Commission on the prolongation of the ELG Scheme which are expected to be concluded shortly.  This will be dependent on the exact phasing of the exit strategy for the guarantee.  It is not possible to make any assessment of the level of possible guarantee fees that may be collected for 2011 and 2012 as this will depend on the availability and scope of any guarantees and the level of guarantee fees approved under EU State aid rules.</P>

	<P>My Department made an application to the EU Commission on 27th January 2010 for funding under the EU Solidarity Fund based on estimates of damage received from Departments and local authorities.  The application was formally acknowledged by the Commission on 24th February 2010.  The EU Solidarity Fund does not fund full reconstruction nor does it fund prevention works.  It funds emergency operations to allow a rapid return to normal living conditions.  A regional application was made as the estimate of the extent of the damage does not meet the Solidarity Fund&rsquo;s threshold of 0.6% of GNI or 935.5m euro for a national disaster.  There are specific criteria which must be met to ensure a successful regional application to the EU Solidarity Fund.  These criteria include the majority of the population of the region being affected by the disaster and serious and long lasting effects on the region&rsquo;s economic stability and living conditions.  My Department, with the assistance of other Departments and agencies, has finalised the costs underpinning the application.  The finalised application was sent to the Commission on 15th June 2010.  The Commission will now assess the application, in light of the eligibility criteria, to determine if aid from the Solidarity Fund will be made available.</P>

	<P>The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI) is governed by the Central Bank Act 1942 (as amended), the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and the Treaty of Rome and is not directly responsible to me for the cost of financial regulation.  However, the Central Bank Act 1942 requires my approval for an annual statement by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority (IFSRA) of proposed income and expenditure specifying the amounts to be raised by levies in respect of financial regulation.  Once I have approved it, the statement is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In addition, the annual report of the IFSRA which shows the outcome of income and expenditure in the previous year is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas each year.</P>
        <P>The CBFSAI has advised me that over the three-year period from 2007 to 2009 some 50 per cent of the total costs of the Financial Regulator have been met by the imposition of levies on the industry.  The balance of the total annual costs is provided by the CBFSAI in accordance with Section 33(L) of the Central Bank Act 1942. In 2009, the CBFSAI bore the full cost of certain securities market supervision activities carried out within the Financial Regulator.  These costs, totalling &euro;3.4 million, were excluded from the Net Industry Funding levies issued to the industry in 2009.  In addition, under the provisions of the Central Bank Act 1942 (Section 33J) Regulations 2009, a supplementary levy was imposed on credit institutions covered by the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 which is designed to recoup 100 per cent of the costs of the more intensive level of supervision necessary to ensure compliance by relevant credit institutions with the provisions of the Scheme.  There is also a cap on the amount of the levy payable by Credit Unions equivalent to 0.01% of a credit union&rsquo;s total assets.</P>
        <P>The Budget of the Financial Regulator for the year ended 31 December 2009 amounted to &euro;63.59 million of which &euro;34.5 million was to be funded by way of a subvention from the CBFSAI.  The following table shows the contribution from each industry category.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I pointed out in my Banking Statement on 30 March, the unavoidable reality is that the bank has incurred losses from its large-scale property lending and needs substantial further capital.  I also made clear that unpalatable as it is, only the taxpayer can provide this capital and in view of the huge costs of an immediate liquidation or wind-down of the bank which I set out in my statement this was the least worst option in light of the imperative of continuing to maintain overall financial stability.  I made clear that there is simply no alternative that meets the bank&rsquo;s unavoidable obligations at a lower cost consistent with the maintenance of the hard-won stability of the banking system in Ireland.</P>
        <P>For that reason in addition to the promissory note provided to the bank at that time, to take account of the bank&rsquo;s losses to date, I confirmed that the bank will need further capital to cover future losses and accomplish the restructuring of the bank and its balance sheet and this was estimated at that time to be of the order of the figure referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  In my statement I drew attention to the fact that notwithstanding very substantial work underway on the bank&rsquo;s restructuring Plan, there are still significant uncertainties about this figure including; the size of the discount on all of its loans transferring to NAMA, the scale of future losses on its loans that are not transferred to NAMA and the exact nature and the scope of any split of the bank under its plans and the EU Commission Decision on the plan.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the estimate provided at end-March remains the bank&rsquo;s base case estimate of the additional capital required, taking into account the further capital <Col N="740"/>support provided at the end of May.  The figure was included as part of the bank&rsquo;s restructuring plan submitted to the European Commission at the end of May.  Work is continuing with the bank involving the NTMA, the Financial Regulator and my Department to refine this estimate in the context of ongoing discussions with the Commission on the restructuring plan.  However, the uncertainties I referred to in my banking statement remain, in relation to for example the loan-by-loan assessment of the bank&rsquo;s loans transferred into NAMA.</P>
        <P>I wish to reiterate that while the sums required to rescue the bank are enormous the costs of winding it down are even greater.  The current bank strategy of seeking to devise a way to realise value for the taxpayer out of the remains of the old bank means the State could at least get some return, in time, recouping some of its assistance.  I can again assure the House that the bank shares my overriding objective to maximise the potential return for the taxpayer in recognition of the State support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the latest Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS), released earlier this week, the number of people in employment in Ireland fell by 108,000 (-5.5 per cent) in the year to the first quarter of 2010.  While there is no doubt that this is a disappointing figure, it should be noted that the rate of employment loss is slowing compared to last year, when employment fell by 8.1%. A total of 275,000 people were classified as unemployed in the QNHS for the first quarter of 2010.  The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 12.9% in Q1 2010, down from 13.3% in Q4 2009.  Labour force participation rates have declined, falling by 1.3 percentage points, year-on-year, in the first quarter of 2010.  The decline was more pronounced for males, declining by 2.0 percentage points, reflecting the strong difficulties in the male-dominated construction sector and the challenges of re-skilling this group.  </P>
        <P>The numbers of non-Irish nationals in the labour force is estimated to have declined by an annual 53,500, or 15.9 per cent, in the first quarter of 2010.  A significant amount of this is due to outward migration.  Considerable anecdotal evidence would point towards the outward migration of Irish nationals also.  While firm data are not yet available, the annual CSO release, Population and Migration Estimates, will be available in the Autumn, and will provide more comprehensive data on current migration trends.  As our economy improves, and employment growth returns, I would hope that much of the short-term outward migration by Irish nationals will be reversed.  In terms of the public finances, I would point out that labour market trends are broadly in line with expectations, and these developments have been taken into consideration in terms of the forecasts for Government revenue and expenditure.</P>

	<P>To date in 2010, I have issued a Promissory Note with a principal amount of &euro;10.3 billion to Anglo Irish Bank.  I have also provided capital of &euro;2.7 billion to Irish Nationwide Building Society which comprises &euro;100 million for Special Investment Shares and a Promissory Note of &euro;2.6 billion.  The recapitalisation of INBS and Anglo Irish Bank has been made pending the agreement of the respective restructuring plans for those institutions with the EU Commission.  In that context, the Promissory Notes have been classified for the time being as financial transactions with no effect on the General Government Balance in 2010.  This decision can be reviewed as necessary following the outcome of discussions with the Commission on the restructuring plans.  Although the Promissory Notes were issued this year, no money in respect of the Notes will be borrowed in 2010 as the first redemptions, involving the payment of the first 10% of the principal amounts, will not arise until March 31st 2011.  It is envisaged that the principal amount of the Notes and the accrued interest on the Notes will be payable over a ten to fifteen-year period and that the money will be borrowed as required in the normal way by the issuing of bonds by the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>While there are no specific proposals for a speculative currency transaction tax, considerations of how to ensure that the financial sector contributes to the cost of dealing with crises is underway in various fora internationally.  The IMF is due to report to the G20 Summit later this month. In a preliminary report in April the IMF focused on two possible contributions from the financial sector:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A Financial Stability Contribution levy (FSC) to pay for the fiscal cost of government support of the sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This would be linked to a resolution regime to avoid moral hazard. This is intended to complement the regulatory and supervisory reform package, and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Financial Activities Tax (FAT) &mdash; a broader tax levied on the profits of financial institutions to curb risk taking behaviour, tax the externalities and pay for the broader cost of financial crises. Revenue generated by the FAT would be part of general government revenues while revenue from the FSC could be part of general revenues or used to finance a dedicated resolution fund.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The European Commission&rsquo;s recent Communication supports the establishment of ex ante resolution funds, funded by a levy on the banks to facilitate the managed failure of ailing banks in an orderly manner and suggests that a resolution fund should form part of the toolbox of measures available to Member States in an EU crisis management framework.  It is important to note that an objective of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, in conjunction with its wider proposals on a crisis management system, is to mitigate the burden on the taxpayer arising from financial crises.  As acknowledged in the Commission Communication, it would be difficult at present to initiate a single pan European resolution fund.</P>
        <P>In my dealing with the banks I have clearly maintained the principle that the banks will contribute to the cost of State&rsquo;s support &mdash; the banks have been charged for the Government&rsquo;s guarantee of their liabilities and the NAMA Act provides for a levy on the banks should NAMA result in a loss for the taxpayer.  In the context of the enhancement of supervision and the restructuring of the banking sector underway in Ireland it is my intention to ensure that <Col N="742"/>the sector contributes its appropriate share, thereby minimising as much as possible taxpayers&rsquo; exposure to potential costs arising from State support of the banking sector.</P>

	<P>As I have stated previously, I believe there is little or no scope for increases in marginal income tax rates, so it will be necessary to examine other ways of broadening our tax base.  A property tax is one means of doing so.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has already successfully introduced a levy on second homes which yielded of the order of &euro;63 million in 2009 and &euro;18 million to date in 2010.  The Deputy will be aware that the introduction of this more general property tax represents a major structural change in the tax system and as such would have to set in the wider context of the overall tax burden on individuals, the compelling need for base broadening measures and current market conditions.  In terms of moving to a more general tax on property, the form of taxation will have specific regard to the commitment in the <i>Renewed Programme for Government</i> to introduce a Site Valuation Tax for non-agricultural land, following the necessary valuation and registration process.</P>

As of the end March, liabilities guaranteed under the Covered Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme (CIFS) amounted to &euro;130 billion while liabilities under the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme (ELG) amounted to &euro;139 billion.  I would expect further amounts of the eligible liabilities currently covered under CIFS to rollover into ELG as they mature however as the Deputy is aware, asset-covered securities and dated subordinated debt, which together amounts to &euro;11.8 billion at end March, cannot be covered under the ELG.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>While the past few years have been difficult for us all, with many challenges to be addressed, this Government has developed, and is implementing successfully, a number of strategies to tackle effectively the budgetary, banking and competitiveness issues we face. These strategies have been welcomed by many commentators and by bodies such as the European Commission, the OECD and the IMF.  </P>
        <P>In broad terms, Ireland&rsquo;s economic difficulties in recent years can be traced to a loss in cost competitiveness and a dramatic deterioration in demand in our major trading partners.  The deficit in the public finances mainly reflects unsustainable levels of public expenditure as compared to the revenues being generated, although support for the banking sector has also had an impact. The recent reports by the Governor of the Central Bank and by Mr Regling and Mr Watson shed light on the origins  of these difficulties and are to be welcomed in that context.</P>
        <P>It is also worth noting that many other countries &mdash; especially advanced countries &mdash; have found themselves in a similar position to Ireland, although I fully recognise that the scale of the problems here is larger than elsewhere.</P>
        <P>In relation to competitiveness, Government policy is supportive of promoting an export-led recovery in Ireland.  Price levels and wages &mdash; including those for the public service &mdash; are all adjusting rapidly to the new circumstances and are contributing to improving Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  We have also made significant investment in areas such as productive infrastructure which will enhance our competitiveness and capacity to grow.</P>
        <P>In terms of the public finances, decisive expenditure-reducing measures have been implemented, and demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s resolve to restoring sustainability to the public finances.  Repairing the tax base is also part of the approach.  I want to stress that the Government remains determined to implement appropriate measures in the 2011 Budget and in later years in order to reduce the deficit below 3 per cent by end-2014.</P>
        <P>In relation to banking, the Government has agreed significant reform to ensure that the structures for financial regulation meet the Government&rsquo;s objectives for the maintenance of the stability of the financial system, for effective and efficient supervision of the financial sector and for the safeguarding of consumer interests. The key change is the establishment of a new single, fully integrated regulatory institution, the Central Bank of Ireland, which will be responsible for both the supervision of individual firms and the overall stability of the financial system. This development is in addition to a series of measures which will help ensure the stability and liquidity of the banking system, which will maintain and rebuild the capital position of our systemically important banks; and which will address the issue of confidence in the asset quality of the banking system via the National Asset Management Agency.</P>
        <P>In relation to Public Service reform, it should be remembered that the OECD, in its 2008 review of the Irish Public Service, gave a generally positive assessment of the Irish Public Service and the role it has played in our national development.  Following the OECD Review and the report of the Task Force on the Public Service, the Government developed a strategy for the delivery of change in the Public Service which is set out in Government Statement on Transforming Public Services (TPS).  The overall theme of TPS is a more integrated Public Service having greater connectivity and linkages across Departments and agencies to deliver an improved level of performance for customers together with greater connectivity.  The Trans<Col N="744"/>formation Agenda is being headed by a Cabinet Committee chaired by the Taoiseach, and Minister of State Calleary has been given responsibility for driving the Transformation Agenda.</P>
        <P>On foot of these policy measures, domestic and international confidence in the Irish economy has been enhanced and there is now general agreement that the Irish economy will begin to expand once again from the second half of this year. More generally, we are positioning the economy to be able to take advantage of the emerging global recovery and we will continue to work hard to ensure we chart a way forward for this country that will be sustainable and that will underpin living standards and employment in the future.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the significant increase in mortgages in arrears for 90 days or more, now totalling 32,321; if he will provide an update on the progress made by the interdepartmental mortgage arrears review group; if he envisages a need for legislation to implement the recommendations of this group; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[25606/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The continued rise in arrears levels is disappointing, but in line with expectations. The numbers in arrears and the amount of lending involved are still at relatively low levels.  Mortgage arrears are reckoned to track unemployment, with a lag of 6 months or so and the expectation is that mortgage arrears should stabilise in the course of this year as the unemployment position improves.</P>
        <P>The figure of 32,321 mortgages in arrears in excess of 90 days referred to by the Deputy does not equate to the actual number of homeowner in arrears.  This is because an estimated 20% of homeowners have two or more accounts, which are included in the figures quoted by the Deputy and reported by the Financial Regulator for period ended March 2010.  Examples of this are where the mortgage is divided into part-fixed and part-variable or where a second account was opened to cover spending on an extension.</P>
        <P>As has been stated on many occasions in this House, it is a priority of the Government to ensure that as far as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession.  I am confident that the support measures been taken by Government, including the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Mortgage Interest Subsidy Scheme and the services provided by MABS, are having a positive effect in this regard.</P>
        <P>I note from the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s most recent data on mortgage arrears and repossessions that there has been a decrease of almost 31% in the number of applications to the Courts by mortgage lenders for legal repossession of properties in arrears, compared with figures for end quarter 2009.</P>
        <P>In February this year, I announced the establishment of an Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney, as a follow up to the Government&rsquo;s commitment under the Revised Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The Group has been in contact with various stakeholders on the mortgage arrears issue, and is preparing to submit a report to me by the end this month.  Until the Group reports to me with its recommendations I am not in a position to say if legislation will be required.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, both AIB and Bank of Ireland have each submitted SME lending plans for 2010 and 2011 in light of the &euro;3 billion target.  These plans are being reviewed by my officials and Mr John Trethowan, and are the subject of ongoing discussions.  </P>
        <P>It is my firm intention that summary versions of the plans when finalised will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, the detailed contents include commercially sensitive information which will have to be redacted prior to publication.  I do not consider it to be in the public interest to divulge the sectors or geographical areas which individual banks consider offer the best prospects for growth.

        <Quest> his views on the publication by EUROSTAT of 2009 data on EU governments&rsquo; deficits and debt burdens which showed Ireland to have had the biggest general government deficit of any EU member state for 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On April 22nd Eurostat published fiscal data which showed a General Government Deficit of 14.3% of GDP for Ireland in 2009. This figure is a revision of the Budget day estimate of 11.7% of GDP due to a technical reclassification of a &euro;4 billion investment by the government in Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>However, there is no additional borrowing as a result of this technical reclassification.  The underlying General Government Balance excluding this reclassification is 11.8% of GDP, which is broadly in line with the Budget day estimate.</P>
        <P>This reclassification is a once-off adjustment that only impacts on 2009 and does not affect the forecast for a General Government Balance of the order of 11&frac12;% of GDP for 2010. That said, it is important to note that our deficit is very high and this is why we have taken the various series of measures since July 2008 to strengthen the budgetary position. Furthermore, it points to the need for continued fiscal discipline and further adjustments.</P>
        <P>In that context, Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal targets have not changed in light of these statistical returns, and the Government&rsquo;s agreed target to reduce the General Government Deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2014 still stands. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On 30 March 2010 I gave details to the House of the further capital needs of the banks in order to meet the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s requirement of a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8%, of which 7% must be equity.  In the case of AIB I said the Regulator has determined that AIB must raise additional equity capital of at least &euro;7.4 billion by the end of the year to meet the new base case capital standards. As the first step in meeting its capital needs AIB has commenced the process of sale of overseas assets.  The disposal proceeds will provide significant capital but will not be sufficient to address the full requirement. To the extent that the gap is not filled by the private sector the State is willing to convert some or all of its preference shares as required on terms to be agreed that will provide full value for the State. Depending on the structure of the capital raising and the extent of private participation, no new Exchequer funding may be required. But if additional money is required, it will be provided by way of ordinary equity. Any additional capital requirement will be met from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  As I have stated previously, if sufficient private capital is not available it is possible that the State will have a majority shareholding in AIB as a listed entity.</P>

        <Quest> the total amount, and the terms, of promissory notes transferred to date by the Government to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society; the total amount for which he expects to issue promissory notes during 2010; the way these promissory notes affect the General Government Balance in 2010 and beyond; the date on which the first payments fall due; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>To-date, I have issued Promissory Notes with a principal amount at &euro;2.6 billion in the case of Irish Nationwide Building Society and &euro;10.3 billion in the case of Anglo Irish Bank. The Notes are payable, on demand from the institutions concerned, at the rate of 10% of the principal amount per annum over a ten-year period commencing on March 31st, 2011, from the Central Fund. </P>
        <P>An annual coupon, linked to Government bond yields, is payable to INBS and Anglo Irish Bank on the outstanding principal balance of the Promissory Notes. The coupon is payable in order to ensure that the principal amounts of the Promissory Notes can be recorded at  &ldquo;fair value&rdquo; in the respective balance sheets of both institutions in line with accountancy requirements. At my discretion, the interest coupon can be paid each year from the Central Fund or, alternatively, deferred and rolled up into the principal amount. Any unpaid interest which is rolled up in this manner will fall due to the institutions concerned only after payment of the original principal amounts. The full repayment/redemption period of the Promissory Notes may, therefore, extend beyond ten years.</P>
        <P>The timing and extent of the provision of further capital to Anglo Irish Bank remains under consideration. The question of issuing further capital to INBS has not arisen for consideration up to this point in time.</P>
        <P>As a consequence of the issuing of the Promissory Notes, General Government Debt is increased by &euro;12.9 billion in 2010.  There will, however, be no actual Exchequer borrowing associated with these transactions for 2010 as the first payment will not arise until March 31st, 2011. The 2010 recapitalisation of these institutions should be seen in the context of the restructuring plans for both institutions. Pending agreement on these plans, it is appropriate not to include the Promissory Note amounts in the General Government Balance measure until the matter can be reviewed on foot of any decision made by the European Commission on these plans.</P>

        <Quest> if he will estimate the general Government deficit for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, inclusive of capital injections to Anglo <Col N="749"/>Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>On April 22nd this year Eurostat published a revised estimate of a General Government Deficit of 11.5% for Ireland in 2010. The forecasts for the General Government Balance for the years 2011 to 2014 published in Budget 2010 remain unchanged.</P>
        <P>The 2010 recapitalisation of Irish Nationwide Building Society and Anglo Irish Bank has been made pending the agreement of the respective restructuring plans for those institutions with the EU Commission. Until these plans have been agreed, it is not appropriate to include the Promissory Notes issued to these two institutions in any measure of the General Government Balance. In that context, the Promissory Notes have been classified as financial transactions, and thus have no effect on the General Government Balance in 2010. This decision can be reviewed as necessary following the outcome of discussions with the Commission on the restructuring plans.</P>
        <P>The re-classification of the capital injection in Anglo Irish Bank in 2009 of &euro;4bn impacted on the General Government Balance only in 2009 and had no effect on the estimate for subsequent years. Any potential future re-classifications of injections into financial institutions would also affect only the year in which that might occur and would not affect the forecasts for future years.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct to note that both the consumer price index (CPI) as well as the harmonised European measure (HICP) have risen since January of this year. Much of this effect is seasonal. Consumer prices almost always rebound in February and March after the January sales. The CPI has risen by more than the HICP, mainly due to the rise in market mortgage interest rates after the exceptionally low levels of 2009.</P>
        <P>On a year-on-year basis the CPI has fallen by 1.1 per cent in the twelve months to May, while the HICP fell by 1.9 per cent over the same period. The declines are very broad-based, with falls recorded across 9 of the 12 main CPI sub groups. This is helping to bring about a welcome improvement in Irish competitiveness at this time.</P>
        <P>At Budget time last December my Department forecast that a further modest fall in consumer prices was likely this year, followed by low, but positive, inflation in 2011 and in following years. The data in the year so far support these projections.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, since 29 September 2008, the State has guaranteed certain liabilities of credit institutions in Ireland initially under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme (the &lsquo;CIFS&rsquo; Scheme) but more recently under the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme (the &lsquo;ELG&rsquo; Scheme). Both Schemes set out extensive terms and conditions.  The CIFS scheme applies comprehensive information and monitoring provisions to the credit institutions covered by the scheme and provides for enhanced coordination and reporting between the Central Bank, the Regulatory Authority and my Department so as to ensure the realisation of the Scheme&rsquo;s objectives.  These provisions in turn apply to the ELG Scheme.  Directions may also be issued in respect of commercial conduct and transparency under both schemes.</P>
        <P>The ELG Scheme, which commenced on 9 December 2009 following Oireachtas and EU State aid approval introduced important changes to the Guarantee for financial institutions bringing it more into line with the mainstream approach to similar guarantees in other EU Member States. The Scheme is intended to facilitate the ability of credit institutions in Ireland to issue debt securities and take term deposits with a maturity post-September 2010 of up to five years, on either a guaranteed or unguaranteed basis.</P>
        <P>The amount of liabilities guaranteed under the CIFS Scheme stands at &euro;130bn in total at end March 2010 and the amount of liabilities guaranteed under the ELG Scheme stands at &euro;139 in total at end March 2010.  The amount of liabilities guaranteed for each individual institution is sensitive commercially for the institutions and I have therefore confined my reply to aggregate figures.</P>
        <P>The State receives a fee from the institutions in return for the guarantees.  The fee under the ELG Scheme is in line with the current ECB pricing recommendations on government guarantees for bank debt.  The average fee for short-term bank debt now stands at 50 basis points under the ELG scheme. The fee structure for liabilities with a maturity of greater than one year is differentiated for institutions based on their credit ratings for liabilities.</P>
        <P>The yield to the Exchequer in respect of guarantee fees as remuneration from the institutions for the availability of the State Guarantee is expected to amount to at least &euro;1 billion over two years from September 2008.  To date &euro;718m in respect of the CIFS scheme and &euro;90.5m in respect of the ELG scheme has been collected from the institutions.</P>
        <P>The fees charged to guaranteed institutions have been approved by the European Commission and help ensure the compatibility of the guarantee schemes with EC state aid requirements.</P>
        <P>I will continue to keep this most important area under review. The bank guarantee scheme includes strict terms and conditions on covered institutions to ensure that the public interest, which includes the general consumer and small business sector, is protected. By putting guarantees in place we have removed a major obstacle to financial institutions continuing to play their proper role in facilitating viable enterprises and individuals with credit where it is sought consistent with prudent and proportionate lending behaviour.</P>
        <P>In terms of the continuation of financial support in the future in the form of the guarantee, I have said that I intend to make an announcement shortly on the future of guarantee when negotiations with the EU Commission are concluded on the end June review under state aid rules.</P>

All applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006.</P>
        <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that these applications were refused on the 9/11/2009 on the grounds that it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits for highly skilled, highly paid positions or for non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or where there is an officially recognised scarcity of workers of a particular type or qualification.  Furthermore, it appeared from the information submitted in support of the applications that the prospective employees were already working for this employer without having a valid employment permit.  Under the Employment Permits Act 2006 it is an offence for both an employer and an employee to be party to the employment of a non-EEA without a correct and valid employment permit.</P>
        <P>The employer appealed this decision on the 30/11/2009.  Having examined the appeal, the Appeals Officer upheld the original decision in April 2010 and the fees were refunded to the applicant.  In these circumstances, therefore, I regret that it is not possible to re-visit this case.</P>

        <P>The disability criteria for these concessions are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of these Regulations.</P>
        <P>Some 13,500 people benefited under the scheme in 2009 at an overall estimated cost of &euro;56 million.  Any changes would have to be considered in the context of the annual Budget.</P>

	<P>My Department made an application to the EU Commission on 27th January 2010 for funding under the EU Solidarity Fund based on estimates of damage received from Departments and local authorities. The application was formally acknowledged by the Commission on 24th February 2010. The EU Solidarity Fund does not fund full reconstruction nor does it fund prevention works. It funds emergency operations to allow a rapid return to normal living conditions.  </P>
        <P>A regional application was made as the estimate of the extent of the damage does not meet the Solidarity Fund&rsquo;s threshold of 0.6% of GNI or 935.5m euro for a national disaster. There are specific criteria which must be met to ensure a successful regional application to the EU Solidarity Fund. These criteria include the majority of the population of the region being affected by the disaster and serious and long lasting effects on the region&rsquo;s economic stability and living conditions.</P>
        <P>My Department, with the assistance of other Departments and agencies, has finalised the costs underpinning the application. The finalised application was sent to the Commission on <Col N="757"/>15th June 2010. The Commission will now assess the application, in light of the eligibility criteria, to determine if aid from the Solidarity Fund will be made available.</P>

        <Quest> the extent to which he has identified by reference to the consumer price index or other mechanisms the precise cause or causes of inflation in the economy in each of the past ten years to date; the precise degree of inflation in each of the contributory causes; the degree to which he proposes to address such issues directly with a view to restoration of competitiveness throughout the economy in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Over much of the last decade, inflation in Ireland exceeded that in the euro area as a whole. Some of this was due to convergence effects. Exchange rate movements also had an impact. In addition, the strength of demand and the low level of unemployment pushed up domestic prices.</P>
        <P>Over the last two years this situation has reversed. On a year-on-year basis the consumer price index (CPI) fell by 1.1 per cent in the twelve months to May, while the harmonised index of consumer price (HICP) fell by 1.9 per cent over the same period. The declines are very broad-based, with falls recorded across 9 of the 12 main CPI sub groups. Many prices in the services sector are showing an unprecedented year-on-year decline too. Between 2008 and 2010, the European Commission expects consumer prices to have risen by about two per cent in the euro area but to have fallen by about 3 per cent in Ireland. This is helping to bring about a welcome improvement in Irish competitiveness at this time. </P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the degree to which he alone or in conjunction with his EU colleagues have provided or intend to provide adequate protection against money laundering; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>EU action in the area of anti-money laundering is primarily contained in the Third Money Laundering Directive (Directive 2005/60/EC).  Primary responsibility for domestic legislation in the anti-money laundering area lies with the Minister for Justice and Law Reform who has transposed the Directive into Irish law in the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 which was signed into law on 5 May 2010. The Act also consolidates the existing money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994. The provisions of the new Act will be commenced shortly. </P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Act 1994 imposed obligations on financial institutions and, more recently, on lawyers, accountants and auctioneers to identify their clients and report suspicious transactions to the Garda Siochana and to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The new legislation strengthens the existing anti-money laundering legislation by, among other requirements, widening the offence of money laundering, establishing a system of compliance monitoring by competent authorities, requiring designated persons to identify the beneficial ownership of unlisted companies and trusts and introducing the concept of a risked based approach which will enable designated persons to concentrate resources on higher risk areas.</P>
        <P>The new legislation will also strengthen the powers of the Financial Regulator by allowing him to impose administrative sanctions for breaches of its provisions.  The Financial Regulator <Col N="758"/>is also devoting substantial additional resources to the inspection of credit and financial institutions to ensure compliance with their anti-money laundering obligations.</P>
        <P>Apart from the Third Money Laundering Directive the EU has also introduced regulations to ensure full identification of persons transmitting funds by wire transfer (EC Regulation 1781/2006) and to require declaration of large cross-border cash movements (EC Regulation 1889/2005).  These Regulations have direct effect in all Member States.</P>
        <P>The issues of money laundering and criminality generally are also regularly discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the progress that has taken place in the matter of new provisions to assist homeowners who through no fault of their own have fallen into arrears and who may find themselves in danger of repossession; if it is intended to introduce measures as promised during the passage of the National Assets Management Agency legalisation in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Renewed Programme for Government sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitments for introducing new measures to protect families having difficulties with their mortgage repayments and personal indebtedness under the headings <i>Protecting the Family Home</i> and <i>Helping Those in Debt</i>.  I have spoken extensively about the Government&rsquo;s intentions in this regard, including during the passage of the National Asset Management Agency legislation as referred to by the Deputy. </P>
        <P>Repossessions in Ireland continue to be low and a comparison of repossession figures for Irish Banking Federation members who are the mainstream lenders, not including sub-prime lenders, with figures from the UK Council of Mortgage lenders shows that UK repossession rates per 100,000 mortgages at thirty times those in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In addition, I note from the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s most recent data on mortgage arrears and repossessions that there has been a decrease of almost 31% in the number of applications to the Courts by mortgage lenders for legal repossession of properties in arrears, compared with figures for end quarter 2009.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be familiar with the support measures in place to assist those homeowners in difficulty.  These measure include the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears which requires lenders to wait at least 12 months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossessions; the Mortgage Interest Subsidy Scheme which provides money, subject to a means test, towards the interest payments on a home mortgage; and the services provided by the Money Advice Budgeting Services (MABS). MABS is the main Government funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that in February this year, I announced the establishment of an Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney.   As part of its work, the Group has held discussions on mortgage arrears issue with stakeholders representing lenders and borrowers.  I understand that the Group will be ready to report to me with its recommendations on the mortgage arrears issue by the end of this month.</P>

	<P>The table shows the performance of the main tax-heads against profile for the first five months of the year. As the Deputy can see, in overall terms, &euro;12,117 million in tax revenue was collected, meaning there is a shortfall of &euro;148 million or 1 per cent. Thus, tax revenues are broadly in line with expectations at this point in the year and the budgetary targets for the year as a whole remain valid. Non-tax revenue receipts at &euro;176 million are also in line with expectations at the end of May.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Excise Duties are payable on a wide range of products, as well as certain premises and activities.  These include (but are not limited to) charges arising on products such as mineral oils, alcoholic beverages and manufactured tobacco. In addition, Excise Duty includes receipts from the air travel tax, the carbon tax and from betting and licenses for retailing of liquor. Receipts from Vehicles Registration Tax (VRT) are also a component of Excise Duty.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have provided details of VRT receipts for the period 2005 to 2009 and these figures are also set out in the above table. The figures provided are on a Revenue Net Receipts basis, which differ from Exchequer receipts due to timing and accounting issues.  The forecast for 2010 is also included.  VRT represented 22% of overall Excise Duty receipts in 2005 and this had fallen to 8% of total Excise Duties by 2009.  The decline in VRT receipts is due to both a reduction in activity and price as well as changes in the tax policy regarding vehicle emission levels.</P>
        <P>At end-May 2010, &euro;12,117 million in total tax receipts were collected against a target of &euro;12,265 million. This included Excise Duty receipts of &euro;1,704 million, against a target of &euro;1,731 million.  VRT receipts to end-May amounted to &euro;226 million.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have already outlined in my responses to the Regling/Watson and Honohan Reports, I accept the broad thrust of the reports&rsquo; recommendations in relation to fiscal policy.  </P>
        <P>That said as far back as 2004, the then Minister for Finance announced a review of tax incentive schemes.</P>
        <P>Three studies were commissioned in 2005 as part of this process, one by Goodbody consultants, one by Indecon Economic consultants and one internal review by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>Both the Indecon study and the Goodbody study recommended the termination of the schemes with a transitional extension of the expiry date for the tax incentive schemes. Indecon recommended, in most cases, a five-year extension of the July 2006 construction deadline.</P>
        <P>In December 2005, the Minister for Finance announced the termination of most of the schemes with transitional arrangements which drew on the Goodbody and Indecon recommendations.</P>
        <P>These transitional arrangements provided that for projects already in the pipeline where planning application conditions had been met, the 31 July 2006 deadline was extended to 31 July 2008.  In addition the amount of capital allowances available would be reduced to 75% in 2007 and 50% in 2008.</P>
        <P>Since 2006, it has been Government policy to carry out &ldquo;cost benefit analysis&rdquo; on major tax expenditure schemes.</P>
        <P>I have continued the process of dismantling these tax expenditures since my appointment as Minister for Finance.   In the Supplementary Budget in April 2009, I terminated the property related accelerated capital allowance schemes in the health sector.  This covered Private Hospitals, registered Nursing Homes, Convalescent Homes and associated residential units as well as mental health centres.  In addition in Budget 2010 I terminated the scheme for childcare facilities.</P>
        <P>In Finance Act 2010 the restriction of reliefs measure will severely curtail the amount of tax reliefs that can be used to reduce the income tax liability of those on high incomes. It will ensure that, in addition to PRSI and levies, those with high incomes and using reliefs will have <Col N="763"/>an effective income tax rate of about 30%. This measure applies to a list of specified reliefs, including property based reliefs, the use of all of which has been curtailed as a result of this change.</P>
        <P>In relation to the fiscal and economic policies pursued by the Government, it should be noted that General Government surplus was recorded in ten of the 11 years between 1997 and 2007. Over the same period the a General Government debt was reduced from 64% of GDP to 25% of GDP in gross terms and, in net terms was closer to 14% of GDP at end-2007.</P>
        <P>The Regling-Watson report acknowledges that the Irish economy caught up with and surpassed average EU living standards during the past decade.  Despite our recent economic difficulties Ireland remains a high income country with nominal GDP per capita forecast to be approximately 29 per cent higher than the eurozone average this year. The overall level of employment still remains high and is over 35 per cent higher than it was in 1997.</P>
        <P>In relation to the recommendations for further investigation by a statutory Commission of Investigation, it should be noted that the report by Messrs Regling and Watson distinguishes between issues that lend themselves to a formal process of investigation and issues that are, in general, less amenable to a legally-oriented process of investigation and may be more appropriate to policy review.</P>
        <P>In this context, the Government has published a draft terms of reference for a statutory Commission of Investigation having regard to the recommendations of the preliminary reports. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service has been invited to provide its views on the draft terms of reference and the Oireachtas will be invited to vote on a resolution approving a draft Government Order to establish a Commission by end of this month.  It will be a matter for the Commission, when established, to investigate those issues set out in the terms of reference, in accordance with its powers under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.</P>
        <P>In relation to those issues which the preliminary reports considered more appropriate for policy review, the Government accepts the seven key policy lessons outlined in Part IV of the report of Messrs Regling and Watson.  The Government proposes to invite the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service for its views on these key policy lessons and an appropriate motion will be tabled in both Houses shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy seeks an update on events since his similar PQ Ref No 22257/10 answered on 26 May 2010.</P>
        <P>I met with the credit union representative bodies on 26 May 2010 and again on 8 June 2010.  I have informed them that I am listening to the views of credit unions and of elected representatives on the Section 35 issue and that I will reflect on what I have heard.  I will make a statement at Committee Stage of the Central Bank Reform Bill to the effect that I am considering some changes to the proposed Section 35A that will link more closely the powers conferred by the new Section 35A to the framework required for implementing the new rescheduling arrangements.  If I decide to introduce amendments, this will be done at Report Stage.</P><Col N="764"/>
        <P>I understand that all members of the House are being lobbied by the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) on this issue.  The ILCU campaign material makes a number of points on which I would wish to comment.   When the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 was published on 30 March this year, ILCU welcomed the new initiative in its press release that day stating &ldquo;This new arrangement is good for our members and good for credit unions&rdquo;.  ILCU has since formed a different view.  That is, of course, its right.  The credit union sector is not immune to the economic downturn. It needs to be safeguarded to ensure that it can continue to provide assistance to its members in the current difficult economic climate while at the same time lending only within its capacity to do so.  The Government&rsquo;s intention is to facilitate relaxation of the lending limits in conjunction with appropriate regulation of the sector to achieve this objective.</P>
        <P>In my address to the ILCU Conference in April 2009, I expressed my wish to help members who are experiencing difficulty in meeting loan repayments due to unfavourable changes in their financial circumstances in the current economic environment.  I stated that any solution would be subject to the over-arching consideration that the financial position of a credit union is not undermined, the security of members&rsquo; savings is maintained and accurate reporting of the financial status of a credit union is not jeopardised.  Re-scheduling of repayments to a level which is affordable to members should be possible in carefully monitored and controlled circumstances.  Of course, each credit union must fully and properly recognise arrears situations where they exist.   Where members are in difficulty the process of facilitating them must be transparent to board members and regulators so that a credit union is never in doubt as to its own position.  This continues to be my view and the proposed amendment to Section 35 seeks to achieve the desired result.</P>
        <P>The credit union sector has been seeking relaxation of the Section 35 lending limits in an effort to facilitate borrowers who have run into difficulties in repaying their loans and need to have them rescheduled to allow for repayment over a longer period of time.  The lending limits are set in primary legislation.  Together with the measures to balance the increased flexibility in relation to rescheduling, they must apply to all credit unions in a uniform way.  However, as I have indicated above, my Department and the Registrar are exploring ways of meeting the key concerns of the representative bodies.</P>
        <P>Also, as I indicated to the D&aacute;il during the second stage debate on the Central Bank Reform Bill, the Registrar of Credit Unions will take a balanced and proportionate approach to the implementation of any new Section 35 requirements and he has set out for the credit union representative groups transitional arrangements and clarifications on the implementation approach.  The Registrar also wrote to all credit unions on 24 May 2010 indicating that the transitional arrangements will include a 15% provisioning requirement up to 30 September 2011, trial periods, exceptions with regard to top-up loans and relaxation of the 100% provisioning requirement in respect of rescheduled loans which have missed two or more payments.  This should help to ease the position for credit unions in the current financial year and the next financial year ending in September 2011 and allow time for credit unions to adjust to the new regime. I may suggest to the Registrar that he consider refining the provisioning requirement so that it is reduced to 10% from the date of commencement to 30 September 2010.  Overall, the Registrar will take account of individual circumstances in credit unions in exercising the powers being given to him in the Bill.   There is no question of a <i>&ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; </i>approach as is being suggested by the League.</P>
        <P>As indicated by the Registrar during his appearance on 27 May 2010 before the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs, a Regulatory Impact Assessment within the meaning <Col N="765"/>of the term as set out in the Better Regulation Guidelines prepared by the Department of the Taoiseach was not carried out.  However, as he also indicated, an internal analysis was carried out. This examined the level of provisions which are held against rescheduled loans.  The Registrar indicated that he will make this analysis available to the Joint Committee.</P>
        <P>Suggestions have also been made that there was insufficient consultation on this matter.  There was, however, extensive and detailed consultation on the measures now being brought forward.  Following general discussions in early 2009, the detailed views of credit union representative groups on the Section 35 issue were sought and obtained in the summer of 2009.  The provisions to be included in the requirements to be made by the Registrar have already undergone considerable adjustment following discussions between the Registrar of Credit Unions and both credit union representative bodies.</P>
        <P>Concerns have been raised in relation to the need for the Registrar of Credit Unions to consult with the representative bodies before introducing requirements.   As a matter of general practice, the Registrar consults with the credit union representative bodies before introducing regulations or requirements in relation to any aspect of credit union regulation and I understand that he intends to continue with this approach.  However, the independent position of the Registrar of Credit Unions in carrying out the duty of financial regulation is not open to question and the Registrar has the statutory powers and responsibility to introduce, if necessary without consultation, regulatory requirements in the interests of the well-being and stability of the sector.  For this good reason, a requirement for the Registrar to consult with the sector is not included in the legislation.  Neither is it appropriate to provide for an appeals mechanism.  Such a device would render the provisions ineffective and inoperable as decisions of the Registrar would become subject to constant review.</P>
        <P>There is a balance to be struck between meeting members&rsquo; needs to reschedule loans and ensuring the stability of the credit union sector overall.  We are not seeking to have a credit union sector which is over-regulated.  However, we must act now in a prudent and preventative manner.  It is in the interests of every credit union in the country that the stability of the sector is safeguarded. The proposals being brought forward in connection with the Bill will achieve this fundamental aim.</P>

        <Quest> the maximum penalties available in summary proceedings or following trial on indictment in respect of smuggling of cigarettes and other tobacco products; when these penalties were last increased; if he is satisfied with the range of penalties; if he is satisfied that appropriate cases are being brought on indictment; if he is satisfied himself with the penalties imposed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[26054/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The offence of smuggling of cigarettes or other tobacco products is normally prosecuted under section 119 of the Finance Act 2001, which relates to the evasion or attempted evasion of excise duty.</P>
        <P>Where a person is convicted following summary prosecution, the Court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both. The amount of the fine was last increased by the Finance Act 2008.</P>
        <P>The fine that may be imposed on conviction on indictment was increased substantially by the Finance Act 2010, so that it would better reflect the seriousness of the offence. If the value of the goods involved is &euro;250,000 or less, the Court may impose a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970. <Col N="766"/>If their value is greater than &euro;250,000, the maximum fine is three times the value. A term of imprisonment of up to 5 years may also be imposed.</P>
        <P>There is provision also, in section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967, for certain cases prosecuted on indictment to be dealt with in the District Court, in specified circumstances. In such cases, the fine on conviction was increased to &euro;5,000 by the Finance Act 2010. Prior to that, a fine not exceeding &euro;1,269 could be imposed. The maximum term of imprisonment in such cases is 12 months.</P>
        <P>The Finance Act 2005 provides for other offences relating to cigarettes and other tobacco products, including offering for sale or keeping for sale or delivery packs of cigarettes or roll-your-own tobacco that don&rsquo;t have the requisite tax stamp on them. The fines on summary conviction for those offences are generally the same as those for offences under section 119 of the 2001 Act and, as in that case, the current fine of &euro;5,000 was introduced by the Finance Act 2008. For cases prosecuted on indictment, an increased fine of up of &euro;126,970 was brought in by the Finance Act 2010.</P>
        <P>I believe that the penalties are set at a level which constitutes a significant deterrent to smuggling and other tobacco-related offences.</P>
        <P>The decision as to whether cases are prosecuted summarily or on indictment is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, having regard to considerations such as the seriousness of the alleged offence and the value of the goods involved. The penalty to be applied in a particular case following conviction is, of course, a matter for determination by the Courts, having regard to all the relevant circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Where a person dies, their personal representatives are liable for any unpaid taxes. In the case of Income Tax the statutory provisions allowing for this are set out in sections 1047 and 1048 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and there are broadly equivalent provisions in legislation governing the other taxes.   </P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they will normally assess and seek to recover unpaid taxes from the personal representatives if not paid out of the estate of a deceased person. Their approach to the recovery of tax debt in any specific case is influenced, <i>inter alia</i>, by the likely costs of recovery and the prospects of such recovery action being successful.</P>
        <P>Recovery action by Revenue will normally be by way of legal proceedings instituted in accordance with section 960I of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 [which may ultimately impact on the sale or transfer of the assets or property in a deceased person&rsquo;s estate] or by way of attachment under section 1002 of the same Act.</P>

The person in question switched mortgage lender in 2007 but the full entitlement to mortgage interest relief had already been paid for that year so no additional relief is payable for that year.

	<P>The Renewed Programme for Government re-affirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the current co-location programme.  Preferred bidders have been selected for six co-located projects at Beaumont, Cork University, Limerick Regional, St. James&rsquo;s, Sligo and Waterford Regional Hospitals. Project agreements have been signed for the Beaumont, Cork, Limerick and St James&rsquo;s projects.  Two other projects are at earlier stages of the procurement process.</P>
        <P>The co-location programme is a complex public procurement process.  It is a matter for each successful bidder to arrange its finance under the terms of the relevant Project Agreement.  The co-location initiative, like other major projects, has to deal with the changed funding environment.  The HSE is continuing to work with the successful bidders to provide whatever assistance it can to help them advance the projects.  There is a requirement on each of the successful bidders to pay a non-refundable deposit to the HSE on the signing of the project agreement.  The intention of this requirement is to allow the HSE to recoup the expenses that it has incurred in this context.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has made clear that a critical part of its strategy to restore the public finances is to achieve sustainability in the cost of delivering public services relative to State revenues. To help achieve this goal, it will be necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and to reduce public service numbers over the coming years. This requires that the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the health service will continue to apply until the numbers have fallen to the level set out in the Employment Control Framework for the health sector.</P>
        <P>The Framework for 2010-2012 gives effect to the Government decision on employment policy in the public sector and provides that there will be a net reduction in employment of 6,000 from March 2009 to the end 2012 and consequential pay roll savings. Based on numbers reductions already achieved in 2009, the net target reduction to end 2012 is 4,560 WTE. Therefore, the net target reduction in numbers in 2010, and in the following two years, is 1,520 whole-time equivalents.</P>
        <P>The Government decision has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people, persons with a disability and cancer services. Therefore, the Framework provides for a number of grades and posts that are exempt from the moratorium on recruitment and promotion. In addition, the HSE also has the capacity under the Framework to fill some exceptions from the general moratorium provided it achieves the overall target reductions. This provides some degree of flexibility to protect key services once the overall target reduction is being met.</P>
        <P>In order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery, the reorganisation and restructuring of work is required. The redeployment and reassignment of staff, optimal skill mix and scheduling of services  will be an essential part of this process. The Public Sector Agreement reached between public sector unions and management will play an important role in this. The agreement provides for greater flexibility, an extended working day and redeployment of health <Col N="773"/>sector staff. Ultimately, this will have a positive impact on the provision of health services and will allow the transformation agenda to continue.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) continue to be a challenge for health care systems worldwide.  Ireland is not unique in this regard and tackling HCAIs here continues to be a priority for the Government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).</P>
        <P>In March 2007, the HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan.  Over the period of the Plan the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infection by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  The number of MRSA bloodstream infections across the public and private hospital sector for the past three years are &mdash; 536 cases in 2007, 435 in 2008 and 355 in 2009.  This shows a significant decrease of over 33% between 2007 and 2009; the rate of reduction in 2009 over 2008 is over 18%.  Data for the first quarter of 2010 is currently being analysed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and will be published shortly.</P>
        <P>Data on alcohol hand gel usage which is an important part of the hygiene effort shows a twofold increase from 2006 to 2009.  The Guidelines for Antimicrobial Stewardship in Hospitals in Ireland aims to promote the sensible prescribing of antibiotics.  Data on antibiotic consumption collected by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) shows a welcome decrease in antibiotic consumption in hospitals in 2008 for the first time since 2000.  Data for 2009 is currently being finalised by the HPSC and will also be available soon.</P>
        <P>Since May 4th 2008, C. difficile is a notifiable disease: all cases have to be reported to the relevant Department of Public Health.  Guidelines for the Surveillance, Management and Control of C. difficile-associated Disease were published in May 2008.</P>
        <P>In May 2009 I also approved publication of the Health Information and Quality Authority&rsquo;s (HIQA&rsquo;s) National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections.  These Standards include all key areas of importance in the control of HCAIs and the HSE is well advanced in its preparations for HIQA to commence its initial monitoring review under the Standards later this year.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above mentioned developments, in December 2008, the HSE published new Environmental Building Guidelines to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments.  I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of Healthcare Association Infections, including MRSA and C. difficile and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

	<P>The National Cancer Registry of Ireland (NCRI) is a statutory body established in 1991. It has been collecting comprehensive cancer information for the whole population of the Republic of Ireland since 1994.  This information is used in research into the causes of cancer, in education and information programmes and was used in the planning of the National Cancer Control Strategy to deliver the best cancer care to the whole population.</P>
        <P>In 2009 the NCRI published An Atlas of Cancer in Ireland 1994-2003.  The Atlas is based on cancers which were diagnosed during 1994-2003 and registered with the National Cancer Registry. It shows geographical and socioeconomic variations in cancer risk across Ireland and concludes that many of the variations observed are likely to relate to social, economic, cultural and environmental differences between subgroups of the population. These differences may include variations in well-known risk factors such as tobacco smoking and diet or in screening participation, for example, among others. They underline the importance of prevention and early detection in cancer control.</P>
        <P>In this regard, national population screening programmes for both cervical cancer and breast cancer are now in place and I announced in January this year that planning would commence for the introduction of a national colorectal cancer screening programme in 2012. Last year I introduced a ban on the in-store advertising of tobacco products and a ban on the display of tobacco products. Earlier this month, I announced my intention to seek Government approval to draft a Bill restricting the use of sunbeds. All of these measures, together with the work being done by the National Cancer Control Programme in the reorganisation of cancer services, underline this Government&rsquo;s commitment and my commitment as Minister for Health to cancer prevention, early detection and continuing improvements in cancer survival for people no matter what part of Ireland they live in.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The fundamental policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. This is realised through a range of community services such as Home-Help, Home Care Packages, Meals-on-Wheels, and Day/Respite care. Without these supports, many older people would spend longer in acute hospitals, or would be admitted to residential care earlier than might be necessary.</P>
        <P>The HSE has responsibility for the delivery of the Home-Help service, in line with the HSE National Service Plan 2010. This Plan, approved in February last, commits the Executive to provide 11.98 million Home-Help hours nationally this year to over 54,000 people. The target for 2010 for Home-Help hours is unchanged over the 2009 figure.</P>
        <P>Arising from an independent Evaluation of Home Care Packages, published by the Department in December last, the HSE recently established a Task Group to progress this year various improvements in home care provision generally. These include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />introduce standardised access and operational guidelines for the delivery of Home Care Packages;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />adopt a voluntary code of Quality Guidelines for Home Care Support Services for Older People; and</P><Col N="777"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />progress a new Procurement Framework for home care services.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The various Guidelines now being prepared are intended to allow the HSE adopt a more standardised approach nationally to the provision of home care services, including Home Help, and to improve these services from the point of view of provider and recipient alike. The Deputy&rsquo;s reference to linking increased Home Help hours to certain domestic or medical standards is unclear. If he wishes to clarify the proposed increase with the standards in question, I would be happy to consider the matter further.</P>

Following a full assessment of the current situation, the risks of a second wave, the availability of vaccine and other factors, the National Public Health Emergency Team decided, following advice received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, that those in the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups should continue to be vaccinated. This means that up to September 2010, the vaccine will continue to be made available to those in the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups including all those travelling to the southern hemisphere during the upcoming influenza season, but this will be done through GP&rsquo;s and Maternity Units.</P>

	<P>There is no specific legislation in place relating to this issue.  However, driving in such a manner as to splash a pedestrian may be considered, in certain circumstances, as driving without due care and attention, under the terms of Section 52 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (as amended by Section 50 of the Road Traffic Act 1968).  Whether or not a specific incident constitutes &lsquo;driving without due care and attention&rsquo; would depend on the specific circumstances, for example whether the driver had no safe alternative such as slowing down or avoiding the water.  The maximum penalty for driving without due care and attention is a fine of &euro;2,000 and/or three months imprisonment.  </P>
        <P>I have no plans to introduce specific legislation in this area, and I do not believe that such legislation would be either necessary or practicable.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the first named person to whom he refers was granted permission to remain in the State in July of 2005 under the revised arrangements for the non-EEA parents of children born in Ireland prior to 1 January, 2005, known as the IBC/05 Scheme. This permission is currently valid until 12 July, 2010. The person in question is advised to attend her local Immigration Office in order to have that permission to remain in the State extended.</P>
        <P>The second named person entered the State on 14 September, 2006 and applied for asylum on 15 September, 2006. This application was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner on 3 October, 2006 and that decision was upheld by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on 30 November, 2007. The person in question subsequently made an application for <Col N="786"/>subsidiary protection under the European Communities (Eligibility of Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I. No. 518 of 2006. This application was refused and the person concerned was informed of that decision by letter dated 6 January, 2009. A Deportation Order was subsequently made in respect of the person concerned. The effect of the making of a Deportation Order is that the person who is the subject of the Order is required to leave the State within  a specified period and to remain thereafter out of the State. The person in question was deported on 11 March, 2010 following detailed consideration of an application under section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999.</P>
        <P>I should add that an express condition of the IBC/05 Scheme is that the granting of permission to remain under the Scheme does not confer any right or legitimate expectation on any person, whether related to the person granted permission or not, to enter or remain in the State. All applicants granted permission to remain under the Scheme signed an undertaking to this effect.</P>

        <P>It is, however, open to all non-EEA nationals, who are resident outside the State, and who are visa-required to enter the State, to apply to their nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate for an entry visa.

I am equally satisfied that the representations she submitted for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), together with all refoulement issues, were given the fullest consideration before her Deportation Order was made.  This being the case, the decision to deport her is justified.</P>
        <P>However, if new information or circumstances have come to light which have a direct bearing on her case and which have arisen since the original decision to deport was made, there remains the option of applying to me for revocation of the Deportation Order pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  However, I wish to make it clear that any such application would need to be supported by information or documentation which was not presented, nor was capable of being presented, to me before the decision to deport was made.</P>

	<P>The persons concerned, a married couple, entered the State separately and applied for refugee status.  The husband claimed asylum on 29 December 2004 while his wife, accompanied by four minor children, claimed asylum on 15 March 2004.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the persons concerned were entitled to remain in the State until their respective asylum applications were decided.  Their individual asylum applications were refused following the separate consideration of their cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P><Col N="789"/>
        <P>They were separately informed, he by letter dated 23 March 2005 and she by letter dated 17 November 2004, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them and their children.  They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against them and their children.</P>
        <P>Following separate consideration of their cases, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, Deportation Orders were signed in respect of the persons concerned and their children on 15 September 2005.  These Orders were served by registered post requiring them to &lsquo;present&rsquo; at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on Thursday 10 November 2005, in order to make arrangements for their removal from the State.</P>
        <P>The persons concerned initiated Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court challenging the decisions to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.  The Deportation Orders made in respect of the persons concerned were subsequently quashed by the High Court.</P>
        <P>On 23 April 2008 the persons concerned were invited to submit updated representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against them and their children.  Representations have been received on behalf of the persons concerned.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the persons concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

        <P>All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee.

        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.

	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Garda&iacute; for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.  The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives &mdash; 187,864 in 2007; 218,404 in 2008 and 246,194 in 2009.  The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase.  Additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad. There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  However, the Garda&iacute; make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the <Col N="794"/>average processing time for valid vetting applications received at the GCVU may vary from four to five weeks in periods of lower demand to up to about 12 weeks at times when demand is particularly high.</P>
        <P>The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  An additional five persons were assigned to the Vetting Unit recently, bringing the total to 83 personnel currently assigned there, including six Garda&iacute; and 77 Garda civilian personnel.  A further five additional personnel are being recruited on a temporary basis and it is intended that these persons will commence work shortly.  Overall, this represents a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development in Garda vetting began in 2005.</P>

	<P>In any given week, there will be a number of jobseekers who do not attend their Social Welfare Local Office to &lsquo;sign on&rsquo; the live register for various reasons.   For example, the person may have, without notifying the Depart<Col N="795"/>ment, taken up employment, taken a holiday, may be unwell or have forgotten to attend their Local Office, given that signing is done on a four-week cycle and therefore not on the same date each month. </P>
        <P>In such cases, the Department suspends the jobseeker payment of the person who has not signed until their reason for not signing has been established. Where the Department is satisfied that the person continues to fulfil the qualifying conditions for the jobseekers scheme, their payment is restored. In some instances, claims are referred for further investigation.  These measures were applied in cases where customers failed to sign during the week of flight disruption.  Table 1 below shows that the numbers failing to sign during the period of flight disruption was not significantly different from other weeks in same four-week signing cycle.</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A number of additional staff  are being assigned to the administration area of the Office,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The organisation of the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s work has been changed so as to increase   productivity,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A  project to improve the business processes in the office is underway and a number of improvements have already been implemented,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Significant enhancements are being made to the Office&rsquo;s IT and phone systems.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Notwithstanding these measures, it is clear that further additional staff will be required in the short term to address the backlog that has developed. Any such staff must be very experienced and be in a position to operate without significant training. Therefore it has been decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources. The Social Welfare Appeals Officer functions independently of the Minister of Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Income from providing accommodation to students studying Irish in Gaeltacht areas under a scheme administered by the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Income from maintenance payments is not excluded from the FIS means test and is therefore assessable in full. There has been no change in the legislation concerning the assessment of maintenance payments for the FIS means test in the lifetime of that scheme.</P>
        <P>The SW22 was updated in early 2009 to make the position clearer regarding the assessment of maintenance payments for FIS.</P>

	<P>Any person can apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance but will only receive payment if they satisfy all the conditions of the schemes, including being available for and genuinely seeking work.  Homeless persons have the same entitlements under the social welfare system as any other persons and are subject to the same qualifying conditions.   If homeless persons are unemployed but capable of and genuinely seeking work, then they can apply for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment providing they can provide an address, such as a hostel or a temporary place of residence, at which they can be contacted if necessary.</P>
        <P>An address is required from the customer to establish, inter alia, the customer&rsquo;s means, availability for employment and to issue payment.    The jobseeker&rsquo;s claim is not awarded for payment until the person&rsquo;s address is verified.   Where a person presents at a Social Welfare Local Office and states that they are homeless, that is, unable to give an address because they do not know where they are spending the night, the Local Office refers the person to the Community Welfare Officer. If a person does not fulfil the conditions for any of the Department&rsquo;s primary weekly payments, they may be eligible for a basic supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) payment, subject to qualifying conditions, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.</P>
        <P>The SWA scheme also provides for a weekly supplement to meet specific needs such as rent and/or mortgage interest supplement, diet supplement, heating supplement, or a once-off payment to help with the cost of any exceptional needs a person may have which they could not reasonably be expected to meet from their own resources, such as support to those requiring assistance with a rent deposit.  One of the most important supports provided to homeless people through the social welfare system is assistance with rent deposits to enable them to secure private rented accommodation.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless adults as part of their overall housing responsibility and the Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for the health and care needs of homeless adults.  The HSE is responsible for meeting the accommodation and other needs of homeless children under the age of 18.</P>
        <P>As homeless persons have the same entitlements under the social welfare system as any other persons and are subject to the same qualifying conditions, there is no definition of homeless or homelessness required for social welfare purposes. Neither I nor the Department has any func<Col N="799"/>tion in relation to determining if a person is regarded as homeless. This is a matter for the housing authorities under Section 2 of the Housing Act, 1988.</P>
        <P>Persons regarded by a housing authority as being homeless have access to the rent supplement scheme without the need for a housing needs assessment or without having any previous history of renting. In addition, where a person applies for rent supplement, the amount of supplement payable is subject to a limit which is determined by the type of accommodation required and the location of the accommodation. Where a person is homeless or at risk of homelessness, these limits can be exceeded.  These special provisions were introduced specifically to assist homeless persons in accessing the rent supplement scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Enforcement actions against illegal waste activity are a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE). I am satisfied that appropriate powers and resources are available to these enforcement authorities. I have no specific information on illegal dumping problems in South Tipperary.</P>
        <P>The 2005 report of the OEE, The Nature and Extent of Unauthorised Waste Activity in Ireland, identified the unauthorised collection and fly-tipping of waste as a problem area which needed to be further tackled. The extent of fly-tipping is not, however, quantified in the report. The report drew attention to the measures already being taken, including the appointment of some one hundred and twenty additional enforcement officers across the local authorities who continue to be funded by my Department, and the stepped up enforcement activity generally being led by the OEE and the local authorities. It also identified additional actions which would further support the effort to stamp out this socially and environmentally unacceptable practice, such as a &ldquo;man in the van&rdquo; advertisement campaign and use of covert cameras. Non-routine actions are now commonplace, and include vehicle checkpoints and use of CCTV cameras for identification of offenders at fly-tipping hotspots. The implementation of these actions is coordinated on an ongoing basis by the OEE through its National Enforcement Network.</P>
        <P>In addition, in April 2010, my Department informed local authorities that additional funding will be provided towards the costs associated with staff deployment for enforcement related activities. This will further underpin enforcement efforts in 2010.</P>
        <P>In terms of enforcement activity, the data for 2008 indicate there were 19,269 routine litter patrol investigations, 27,825 on the spot fines issued and 608 litter prosecutions. In addition, 12,000 non-litter waste complaints inspections and a further 2,434 other inspections for fly-tipping waste, burning or other surveillance purposes were undertaken by the local authorities. There were 8,151 waste enforcement notices issued and 695 prosecutions initiated but a breakdown as to how many of these related to fly-tipping is not available. Overall, this represents a very significant quantum of enforcement, consistent with the findings of the OEE&rsquo;s Focus on Environmental Enforcement in Ireland, covering the period 2006 to 2008, which indicates that the handling of waste-related complaints has significantly improved.</P>
        <P>I have recently introduced new measures designed to underpin further the effort to combat litter.  I have allocated &euro;1.5 million over three years in support of a new initiative, the Tourist Season Anti Litter Grant Scheme, to assist local authorities in their efforts to tackle litter pollution at key tourist destinations and on key access routes during the peak summer period. It is the responsibility of the local authorities to decide and prioritise where these resources are utilised.</P>
        <P>I have also recently announced the establishment of an Action Group to tackle the problem of rural and roadside litter. The Group will comprise representatives from my Department, the Department of Transport, the National Roads Authority, local authorities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Office of Environmental Enforcement, and is being tasked with reporting back with specific recommendations to underpin further progress in this area.</P>

	<P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &mdash; 2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water and sewerage services infrastructure in County Galway.  While provision is made to commence contracts to the value of some &euro;130 million in the county during the period of the Programme, it was not possible to include the Carna or Kilkieran Sewerage Schemes amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion. </P>
        <P>The new Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth as envisaged in the Government&rsquo;s policy document Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy &mdash; A Framework for Sustainable Economic Revival.    A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Galway County Council, in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time.</P>

	<P>To implement a commitment in the Programme for Government in 2007, re-iterated in the renewed Programme for Government in October 2009, a review of the Environmental Protection Agency commenced in February 2010 following the appointment of members on 2 February 2010. </P>
        <P>The review&rsquo;s terms of reference are as follows: i) To review the legislation governing the EPA, including the licensing functions and the processes in place to ensure public participation and the various remedies and sanctions available to the EPA for enforcement provided in the Acts, and to identify any necessary improvements in the legislation; ii) To assess the performance of the EPA against the mandate which it was given when it was originally established in 1993, in relation to the expanding goals which have been set for it in the past decade and in comparison with best practice elsewhere, and to identify any necessary improvements in the EPA&rsquo;s procedures and approaches; iii) To assess the scope of the EPA&rsquo;s mandate and whether it could be strengthened to include other areas; iv) To review the resources allocated to the EPA in relation to current obligations and further functions that may arise, on foot of EU legislation; v) To assess the structures and governance of the EPA (including the operation of advisory committees and whether non-executive directors should be provided for; and vi) To re-assess the ongoing relationship between the EPA and other parts of the environmental governance structure in Ireland, having regard to the environmental challenges facing Ireland and developments in society.

	<P>In December 2009, following a decision by Government, I informed the House that I would be bringing forward proposals for the installation of water meters in households served by public water supplies. These proposals will give effect to the commitment in the renewed Programme for Government to introduce charging for domestic water in a way that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied. I expect to bring these proposals to Government in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The proposals will include draft legislation to remove the prohibition on charging for domestic water services and will also address the arrangements for the delivery of the water metering programme, cost estimates and how these costs are to be financed, as well as plans for the development of a pricing structure for domestic water services. I will provide further details on these matters following their consideration and approval by Government.  As is the case currently with water charges for the non-domestic sector, the domestic water charge will comprise a charge for both the water supply service and the wastewater treatment service. There are no proposals to charge households providing their own water supply from private sources such as a bored well.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level. Funding provided by my Department in this context relates to the recoupment of 90% of approved expenditure by housing authorities on accommodation for homeless persons, with the balance being funded from housing authorities&rsquo; own resources. The HSE has responsibility for funding in relation to health and care services for homeless persons.</P>
        <P>While the overall provision for housing for next year will be determined within the context of the annual Estimates for Public Services, my focus in shaping that provision will continue to be on the prioritisation of accommodation and accommodation-related support needs of the most vulnerable, disadvantaged households, including homeless people, older people and people with disabilities.</P>

	<P>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, which gives effect to the &euro;200 charge on non-principal private residences, defines &ldquo;owner&rdquo; at section 1 as &ldquo;a person  . . . who . . . is entitled to receive the rent of the property, or where the property is not let, would be so entitled if it were so let&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Where a property is willed or gifted to an individual and a right of residence is retained by the original owner or occupier, I have been advised that liability to pay the charge depends on whether the right of residence is exclusive.  If the right of residence is exclusive and the owner does not have an entitlement to seek or receive rent, he or she is not an &ldquo;owner&rdquo; within the meaning of the Act until that right ceases to affect the property.  In such a case, there would be no liability for the charge.</P>

	<P>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, which sets out the detail of the &euro;200 charge on non-principal private residences, is structured from a starting position of a universal liability for the charge in respect of residential property.  It goes on to exempt certain properties and owners from the charge, the most significant exemption being where a property is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence on the liability date.</P>
        <P>If a property is not occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence, it is generally the case that the property is available to the owner as a source of economic or other benefit.  In a case where a property is being retained as a holiday home for relatives, there is a direct benefit to those relatives from the property being in the owner&rsquo;s possession.  In these circumstances, an annual charge of &euro;200 is modest.</P>
        <P>In devising the charge, it was intended that it should be as simple and straightforward to administer as possible.  I have no plans to introduce graduated rates which would unnecessarily complicate the administration of such a modest charge.</P>

<P>The position is that my Department is involved at a sectoral level in the context of budgetary discussions regarding overall funding and proposals for fee changes in relation to the higher education sector.  However as the Deputies may be aware higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and the criteria governing the level of tuition fees to be charged, in cases where students do not qualify for free fees and in the case of postgraduate study, are determined by the institutions.   As such, post-graduate level fees are set by individual higher education institutions and accordingly I have no role in this matter.</P>
        <P>I would point out that Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U. Member States and in non EU countries. The application form (I.T. 31 Form) to claim tax relief on tuition fees is available from the Revenue Commissioners</P>

	<P>There are no plans at present to include Irish sign language as a specific subject within the national curriculum in primary and post-primary schools in the Junior Certificate, or established Leaving Certificate programmes. Irish Sign Language is one of the optional modules available within the Leaving Certificate Applied programme.</P>
        <P>However, the Transition Year Programme, which is available to schools on an optional basis provides a flexible menu of options designed to further support pupils&rsquo; personal and social development, to provide a bridge between junior and senior cycle and to offer a broad educational experience which can aid the maturing process. As part of this, there is scope for schools to offer a programme on sign language.</P>
        <P>Irish sign language (ISL) has formal recognition in the Education Act 1998. Under that Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Science to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person. This includes provision for students learning through ISL.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement ISL in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system are currently in place. These include:  the special schools for the deaf have been encouraged in relation to the use of sign <Col N="807"/>language in class; funding is available for training of teachers in ISL; my Department has provided funding for an ISL weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for the deaf children, pupils, their siblings and parents.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Teaching Council is the body with responsibility for establishing and maintaining standards in the teaching profession in this State, including the recognition of qualifications for teacher registration.</P>
        <P>My officials have made enquiries with the Teaching Council regarding this matter. The situation is as follows:  Admission to the register of teachers is governed by the Teaching Council [Registration] Regulations 2009, which were approved by the Minister for Education and Science in November 2009. In terms of post-primary registration (Regulation 4), applicants must hold a degree carrying at least 180 ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) credits, gained following a course of study  of at least 3 years, which enables the holder to teach at least one curricular subject. The Teaching Council&rsquo;s view is that the qualifications referred to in this question, from NUI Maynooth, do not meet these requirements. However, the  Council has indicated to NUI Maynooth that holders of undergraduate qualifications in Mathematics (who do not meet the Council&rsquo;s requirements), in addition to the NUI Higher Diploma in Mathematics, could be considered on an  individual basis for registration purposes.  The Council is currently carrying out a Review of programmes of initial teacher education in the State.</P>

	<P>Under the Labour Market Activation (LMA) initiative almost 1,800 unemployed people were supported to embark on part-time undergraduate and postgraduate  programmes from September 2009 in areas that support the goals of the &lsquo;Smart Economy&rsquo;. </P>
        <P>Subject to institutional requirements regarding passing exams and course progression, students who are unemployed, i.e. on the Live Register, are entitled to remain on and receive free fees on their programme of study. If a student gains employment, they will not be required to pay fees for the academic year during which they get a job, however fees will be charged for any subsequent academic years. The fee level is set by each individual institution and information on the fee to be charged for individual courses is available from the institution concerned.</P>
        <P>All students participating on these programmes who continue to meet all Department of Social Protection criteria on eligibility for Job Seekers Benefit and Job Seekers Allowance are entitled to retain their payments while studying on the programme. However participation on a programme does not in itself create an entitlement to a social welfare payment.</P>

        <P>The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

	<P>The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a  requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years. This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social Protection with reference to recent schools&rsquo; enrolment data. The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in the coming years is likely to be greatest in more than 40 identified locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas. </P>
        <P>Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out detailed analysis and reports for each of these locations in order to identify the school accommodation requirements for each area up to and including the school year 2014/2015. The progression of all large scale building projects arising from Forward Planning Section&rsquo;s analysis of accommodation needs will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, all applications for capital funding are assessed in the Planning and Building Unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity etc. leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.</P>
        <P>As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the Education Partners.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the School Building and Modernisation Programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.</P>
        <P>There are four Band Ratings overall, of which Band One is the highest and Band Four the lowest.  Band One projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exist, but there is a high demand for pupil places while a Band Four project makes provision of desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities. Each Band rating has a number of sub categories which more specifically describes the type of works needed and the urgency attaching to them.</P><Col N="814"/>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs  Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resources to schools to support pupils with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology is required.</P>
        <P>Schools may apply to the NCSE for the provision of assistive technology required to support pupils who have been assessed as having a special educational need that requires specific assistive technology support in order to access the curriculum.  The technology is the property of the school and the use of the equipment in the home is at the discretion of the school. Funding is not available to my Department for the provision of computer equipment in a pupil&rsquo;s home.</P>
        <P>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</P>
