	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As I stated in the House on 1 December last, my Department has supported the international financial services industry in Ireland since the establishment of the IFSC in 1987 by providing a forum for the exchange of views and the co-ordination of effort through the mechanism of the IFSC Clearing House Group, supported by working groups in the areas of banking and treasury, funds, insurance, pensions and a task force on asset management.  The Clearing House Group identifies and considers issues of major concern to the long-term development of the international financial services industry in Ireland.  These issues include the strategic development of new business areas and opportunities as well as the progress of relevant legislation, and it identifies, from time to time, the need for responsibility to be assigned for overseeing and reporting to the Government on any appropriate initiatives in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since its establishment in 1993, the Clearing House Group has been chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and its membership includes representatives of industry associ<Col N="384"/>ations and of prominent figures from the international financial services industry.  There are also representatives from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Financial Regulator, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners and the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The spread of membership of the IFSC Clearing House Group and the IFSC working groups enables issues to be discussed in an open way which reflects a wide range of experience and expertise so that opportunities to develop sustainable business and employment in the various sectors of the international financial services industry can be achieved.  It is estimated the industry employs 25,000 people directly and an additional 2,500 indirectly, while contributing &euro;642 million in tax revenue to the Exchequer in 2009.  This figure for tax revenue refers only to companies which were within the original IFSC tax regime and does not cover international financial services companies that commenced trading after 2002.</P>
        <P>The Clearing House Group does not deal with issues relating to individual enterprises or institutions, and it does not supervise or oversee the industry &mdash; that is a matter for the Financial Regulator exercising his independent functions.  In the context of its role in identifying development opportunities, the Clearing House Group has responded to the report of the high level group on green enterprise, which was published in November 2009 and identified the significant contribution that the development of the green economy can make to restoring our economy.  The report stated that potential exists to develop a green IFSC cluster and brand incorporating green investment vehicles, the administration of funds managed under green principles and carbon trading and associated professional services.</P>
        <P>The IFSC banking and treasury group, which operates under the aegis of my Department, has begun a feasibility study into the launching of a green finance initiative within the IFSC.  The concept of a green IFSC would incorporate a centre of excellence specialising in the provision of financial, professional and administrative services to the global climate change sector.  It is hoped that this study, which is receiving support from the various industry associations, professional firms, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, will be completed by the end of June of this year, when its recommendations will be presented to the IFSC Clearing House Group for consideration of future action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask the Taoiseach specifically about the proposal for a green IFSC, to which he referred, which was contained in the report of the high level action group on green enterprise which was published last December.  Launching that report, both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources said that of the order of 20,000 jobs could be created over the five to ten years from the establishment of a green IFSC, which would be very welcome.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, when launching the report, said that a project team would be established early in the new year to progress the idea of the green IFSC.  He also said the green IFSC project would be rolled out over the middle to the end of 2010.  Has the project team been established, who is on it, when will it report and is it still the intention that the green IFSC project will be rolled out from the middle to the end of the year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have explained, the first issue is to undertake a feasibility study to work up this project and to then come in June with the recommendations which will be presented to the IFSC Clearing House Group.  That is in place at present and the study, which is receiving support from the various industry associations, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, will be completed by the end of June, which is the first phase in coming forward and making this a reality.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="385"/>
<?oasys _cl14- ?>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a lot more ambiguous and long term than the statements about this made by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Taoiseach himself in December.  The Taoiseach is now saying a feasibility study is being done.  I would have thought the study would already have been done if it was in the report of the high level action group on green enterprise when it was announced.  It appeared much firmer then compared to what the Taoiseach is now saying.  Is he now saying that the idea of a green IFSC is still at the conceptual stage and that its feasibility is still subject to examination?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources was clear about this.  He said it was planned to create a project team to develop the initiative early in the new year.  There was no mention of feasibility; this was to progress it and a project team was to be set up early in 2010 and the project would be rolled out over the middle to end of next year.  From what the Taoiseach is saying now, there is no project and all that is happening is that a group in the Department of the Taoiseach is looking at the feasibility of the idea and it will in turn report back to the clearing house for the IFSC.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy is engaging in semantics.  The IFSC banking and treasury group has begun work on bringing this about.  We are talking about a report that examines the potential that exists to develop a green IFSC cluster and brand, incorporating green investment vehicles, with the administration of funds managed under green principles, and carbon trading and associated professional services.  Launching a green finance initiative within the IFSC is now the job being undertaken by this group.  It is not within my Department; there are many professionals involved from the banking and treasury sections of the clearing house mechanism, along with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  The fact that we will have it by June of this year indicates the priority we have given to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we see the first green IFSC job or enterprise?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When the group reports to the Clearing House Group for consideration about the future action that will take place as a result.  The work must be done.  The potential for this initiative was outlined in the report the Deputy mentioned.  Work for future action is now being prepared and put in place and those involved are going about it in a systematic and professional way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>How many people are employed in the IFSC?  How much more competitive would a green IFSC be over the current arrangement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Approximately 25,000 people are employed directly in the IFSC.  It has been a very important project that has been resilient, even in the context of the recession and the difficulties in financial services.  Employment has been maintained at that level, which is testimony to its resilience and the diverse nature of the work that goes on there.</P>
        <P>The idea of a green IFSC within the context of what we already have was the subject of a report that has been brought forward by the group, chaired by Mr. Harford, and one of the subcommittees of the Clearing House Group is now examining how the idea could be developed in the context of developing a cluster and brand incorporating green investment vehicles, with the administration of funds managed under green principles, and carbon trading and associated professional services.  It is seen to be an area for potential that must be explored and exploited.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach rightly speaks of the 25,000 employed there, the resilience of the sector and the difficulties in the financial services area. When the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance he oversaw the light touch regulation structure which applies in this coun<Col N="386"/>try.  Last year we had some difficulties with the United States in so far as the categorisation of Ireland was concerned.  Some people considered the terms laid out for Ireland&rsquo;s being a centre for international financial services meant that in the eyes of certain people it was deemed to be a tax haven.  The Government rightly did some work to get the matter cleared up and to establish that this country was never deemed to be a tax haven.  However, it was and is a country where light regulation applied &mdash; until now.</P>
        <P>In that regard, given what is now unfolding, does the Taoiseach consider that the pay-off of close to &euro;1 million to the former regulator, Mr. Patrick Neary, was justified?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is somewhat&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is in accordance with the principles set out for the IFSC, where efficiency, proportionality and all such matters were mentioned by Government.  The question deals with oversight of the banking sector.  The internationally traded financial services centre is very important for Ireland.  If Ireland is to be seen to be in pristine condition from a financial services point of view internationally, this matter must be addressed, clearly and with decisiveness, by strong government.  It is a question concerning which I would like to know the views of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am here to reply to questions laid down that relate to the International Financial Services Centre.  If the Deputy has any other questions to table regarding any other matters he is entitled to do so. </P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has always operated within the framework of EU and domestic law in approving relevant enterprises and products in the IFSC and regulating their operation.  Robust financial regulation is an essential element in maintaining the competitiveness of the economy and it contributes to the sustainability of the financial services centre.  The regulator must evaluate innovations in the industry, in terms of both products and entities, effectively and efficiently with regard to timeliness, cost and clarity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over the years, the Clearing House Group has provided a forum in which financial regulation, in its broad sense of supporting a credible and reputable international financial services centre, has been affirmed repeatedly.  The significance of regulation for international financial services has long been recognised.  It is important to point out that the IFSC operates under the same regulation as other financial services centres in Europe, under European directives, etc.  There is no difference.  We are not different in any way.  The supervisory regime that applies to practically all IFSC activities is based, ultimately, on EU regulatory directives.  The same regulatory regime that applies to the financial sector elsewhere throughout the EU applies equally to the IFSC in this respect.  These directives cover the full range of supervisory tools, including the authorisation of financial institutions, the application of regulatory rules and responses, enforcement, etc.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said the regulator has always operated within EU directives and according to domestic law.  If that is the case, how can he stand over a situation where the regulator oversaw a &euro;2.8 billion loss in the Irish Nationwide Building Society last year alone?  That was bigger than the accumulated profits of the entire&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny, even allowing for latitude, this is drifting.  You must submit a separate parliamentary question on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s claim that the regulator always operated within Irish law.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="387"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Ar aghaidh leat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh maith agat.  If it is the case that the regulator operated within Irish law, then the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance and his predecessor as Taoiseach oversaw a situation where there was no regulation.  For that level of incompetence a pay-off of almost &euro;1 million was paid to the regulator when he left.  Is that justified?  How can we say that we are operating within proper Irish law if, for example, the Irish Nationwide Building Society accumulated losses of &euro;2.8 billion last year alone?  </P>
        <P>If we are serious about this &mdash; and Deputy Cowen in his capacity as Taoiseach will want to be seen in a position where the country is run properly &mdash; there is no reason for our having a confined inquiry into the banking sector.  The material that is emerging now is truly appalling.  It all happened under light touch regulation.  The Taoiseach and his predecessor were Ministers for Finance for part of this time.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that the supervisory role of the previous regulator under Irish law was simply non-existent and has resulted in an appalling economic catastrophe for hundreds of thousands of people?  In that context, if this Government is serious about its business it should sort out the issue once and for all.  There should be an open-ended inquiry into what went wrong in the banking sector and the people should know what happened.  The Taoiseach should have no fear about doing this in the interests of our people and country.  The banking and financial services regime should be seen to be above reproach in order to continue to employ strong numbers and grow in integrity both at home and abroad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of our action is to ensure a regulatory system that will in future seek to guarantee what happened in the past will not occur again.  The independent regulatory system passed here by statute did not meet the requirements of the issue and there are now two reports &mdash; one from the Central Bank Governor and one from two eminent persons &mdash; which will come before the House in June this year.  They will be debated by the Oireachtas and arising from that will be the terms of reference for whatever further inquiries will be necessary arising from that objective assessment.  That is how the process should be dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach consider that the pay-off for the previous regulator was justified?  In the interests of following on those reports about the inadequacies of the regulatory system, does the Taoiseach believe that in everybody&rsquo;s interest it would be good for the Government to indicate there will be an open-ended inquiry beyond the September 2008 date?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have set out the position on how the issue will be dealt with.  In its first stage there will be two reports, which have already been commissioned.  Arising from that and a debate in the House we can see what further steps need to be taken regarding a commission of investigation, etc.  That is the Government&rsquo;s position and it is the best way to deal with the matter.</P>
        <P>The regulator was employed by the board of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and in its wisdom it decided to finalise the arrangements with the regulator in that respect.  That is how the issue stands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not justified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach spoke at the official opening of the city research centre on North Wall Quay last September and stated that in planning to establish a green international services centre, the idea was to build on the existing Irish Financial Services <Col N="388"/>Centre infrastructure to attract companies specialising in financial and support services to the growing international green technology, carbon and renewable energy industries.</P>
        <P>In the course of the rest of his address, the Taoiseach indicated that the intention was to have such development located in tandem with the existing IFSC in the Dublin docklands area.  Has the Government given any consideration to the possibility of locating such a green IFSC at any one of the number of other credible locations across the country, given the numbers of university and institutes of technology centres around the State?  There is an unquestionably sufficient case to be made for Ireland to be to the fore in the development of a green IFSC international image rather than just Dublin.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach should indicate in his response whether he has given consideration to this proposition and, if not, whether he will do so.  One proposal that Sinn F&eacute;in put forward in its Getting Ireland Back to Work paper was the establishment of dedicated business and science parks, to be linked to institutes of technology and universities in different locations that would offer on-site agency, financial, banking and enterprise support.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the enterprise agency&rsquo;s view of the concept of a financial services or science park often is equal to or reflective of the relationship between a landlord and tenant, that is, it is a plot of ground on which it can accommodate certain business interests?  Does the Taoiseach not agree this is a particular field that would allow for a more holistic development of the potential of a green IFSC and that this would have application in a number of sites nationwide?  Has the Taoiseach given consideration to this matter or is it simply assumed that the existing IFSC is the logical co-location for such a proposition?  If he has not done so, would he be prepared to consider this proposal because many other centres are crying out for such investment and the opportunity to show their real worth in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Green financial services already is a growth area in the IFSC at present.  The presence in Dublin of international green operations already acts as a catalyst for the indigenous green economy.  It is a question of building on what already exists and is about encouraging more of these activities and building clusters of expertise and high-value jobs.  It is important that indigenous green enterprise should be vibrant.  In general, Ireland continually seeks new areas of opportunity within the financial services industry, both through reinvestments from existing clients and first-time investments for new entrants.  At present, the areas being explored comprise financial services technology, e-finance and electronic trading, debt capture and predictive analytics, risk management, service innovation and collaborative research and development and pensions and green finance.  These are complementary to existing opportunities being pursued across IDA Ireland&rsquo;s three main business lines of banking, insurance and investment management.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This sector is developing all the time and I made the point that the tax revenue figures I provided refer only to companies that were active within the original IFSC tax regime.  It does not cover international financial service companies that commenced trading after 2002, not all of which necessarily are located within the Dublin Docklands.  While there has been an attempt to accommodate the activity as distinct from the geographic location, in respect of the green initiative the Government is trying to build on existing advances that are being made at present within the IFSC area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response and where he is coming from on it and can only hope to try to encourage some new thinking in this regard.  While I can understand building on what exists at present, surely there are centres at different locations around the State that would cry out for the opportunity to demonstrate their potential to succeed across the entire renewable energies sector.  As for the encouragement of job <Col N="389"/>creation, the expertise and acumen that has been developed out of the existing IFSC undoubtedly is transferable.  It is not a case of individuals coming in off the street because they are trading globally and location is not an absolute requirement in respect of the Dublin Docklands site.  I put the proposition to the Taoiseach that there are areas of the country for which such an investment would make a huge and substantial difference to such a location such as, for example, anywhere across the institute of technology and university sites in cities and large towns.  I put that proposition to the Taoiseach and ask him not to scotch or dismiss it.  It is worth investigating.  Is it not feasible to consider more than one location?  In this, we might open the door for another set of heads and locations to present and show what they can do in this area.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been and are instances throughout the country in which financial companies, perhaps having started in the Dublin area, have moved outside for a whole range of reasons, including the location of expertise elsewhere in the country, but also for good business reasons in terms of costs, property costs, etc.  There have been instances where this has happened.  The whole idea is to have a growing and expanding industry.  It has maintained high levels of employment despite the obvious problems of recent years in the financial services.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Even in the Northern Ireland context, there have been opportunities to co-operate with the Northern Executive.  When the present First Minister was its Minister for Finance and I had that position, we had an initiative in respect of the North-South development of financial services where certain activities in that industry could be competitively done there as against here while there are issues here that we can do that they cannot do.  One makes the cake bigger and ensures one can co-locate jobs, not just within the Republic of Ireland, but north of the Border as well.  So there have been instances.</P>
        <P>We are all open to trying to identify opportunities in every part of the country for this type of well-remunerated employment.  It is not in any way dismissive of it.  It is a question of building, as the Deputy says, on what is there, but that does not preclude businesses where they see an opportunity from locating anywhere within the jurisdiction while at the same time taking the benefits that the IFSC provides in terms of the fiscal regimes, etc.  This has been the case for some time now.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The number of whole-time equivalent staff employed in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions on 1 April of this year was 195.52 compared with 196.2 on 1 April 2008.  During this period, the number of staff in the directing and solicitors divisions has increased by 5.12 <Col N="390"/>whole-time equivalents while the number in the administration and policy divisions has decreased by 5.8.  In other words, the director has been able to achieve savings and efficiencies in the administration of his office so as to preserve front line prosecution services and meet the increase in his workload over the last two years without having to increase overall staff numbers.</P>
        <P>The recent changes in staff numbers have taken place against a background of the solid staffing base that was put in place in the director&rsquo;s office in 2007.  Following a review of staffing requirements at that time, the Minister for Finance approved 28 new permanent posts and one contract post for the office.  Some 21 of these posts were for legal and professional grades, reflecting the increase in the volume and complexity of the work being under taken by the office.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;43.854 million has been provided in the 2010 Revised Estimates to meet the cost of the office in the current year.  My Department&rsquo;s officials will continue to work with officials from the director&rsquo;s office and the Department of Finance to ensure that the necessary resources continue to be available to the director to enable him to discharge his functions fully and effectively.</P>

	<P>Is the DPP subject to the circular issued by the Department of Finance last March, which directed that no vacancy, however arising, could be filled?

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone would agree that it is important that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions should have available to it the staff that are necessary in order to ensure that prosecutions are not delayed, that the enforcement of law can be dealt with in an expeditious manner and that efforts to deal with criminal activity and the resultant legal cases will not be hindered in any way.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the required number of staff is available to the DPP?  Will he also indicate whether further vacancies exist and whether the DPP has requested that these be filled?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not hear what the Taoiseach said in respect of the cost of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for 2010.  Does that office present a schedule of work or projected work to his Department in respect of its Vote?  Is he satisfied that the DPP will have sufficient staff to ensure that the office carries out its duties?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is the Taoiseach in possession of any information relating to the number of cases put before the DPP in respect of which he has provided a reason for his decision?  In the past the DPP explained, in respect of a small number of occasions, the reasons he arrived his various decisions.  These were sensitive cases.  Does the Taoiseach&rsquo;s brief in respect of these questions provide any information in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the policy issue, the DPP is statutorily independent and the Taoiseach is not answerable to the D&aacute;il on matters pertaining to the discharge of that officer&rsquo;s functions.  However, in October 2008 the DPP introduced, on a pilot basis, an initiative whereby he proposed to give reasons for decisions not to prosecute in respect of offences involving a death where the alleged offence occurred on or after 22 October of that year.  To date, there has only been a small number of cases which meet this criterion.  The nature of these cases was such &mdash; for example, some related to single vehicle road accidents &mdash; that there have been very few requests for reasons relating to decisions not to prosecute.  It was originally intended to run the pilot until 1 January 2010.  In light of the insufficient data on which to make a full evaluation, however, it is now proposed to continue it for a longer period before publishing such an evaluation.  That is all the information I have in respect of that matter.</P>
        <P>The composition of the Estimate is set out in the Book of Estimates.  Most of the information contained therein would relate to the staffing and administrative costs of the office.  Costs would also arise in respect of barristers and others employed by the office to prosecute cases, etc.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach indicated that the DPP stated there are no staffing issues at this time.  However, the perception is &mdash; perhaps it is incorrect &mdash; that there have been increased delays in the administration of justice and that part of the reason for this relates to the fact that there are insufficient staff to deal with the both the expanding workload and the complexity of the cases being undertaken by the DPP.  Is the Taoiseach confident there are sufficient staff in the office to deal with all cases and that the Director of Public Prosecutions does not have to refer some cases to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be prepared, as he stated at a committee here not so long ago, rather than have them dealt with only by the DPP as in the past, especially in respect of complicated cases?  There is a perception that justice is being delayed because of a lack of staff or resources in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Different work may be allocated to different people, whether to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or whoever.  The important thing is that it is effectively and efficiently done.  In fairness, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, working within the budgets it has &mdash; all budgets are finite &mdash; has been able to increase the number of front line staff as a result of reorganisations that have taken place.  That is to be commended.  </P>
        <P>I understand there was a higher level of case activity in 2009 than in the previous year.  The 2010 Estimate includes additional funding to meet some demand-led pressures in regard to an increase in the size of awards, etc.  Whatever the perception may be, I relay to the House the information I have from the supplementary briefing material on the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Taoiseach assure the House there is no delay in cases before the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions due to a resource or a staffing issue?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="392"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, like other public service organisations, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is required to critically examine how it operates and to seek to deliver greater efficiencies.  The DPP has taken steps to achieve these efficiencies without adversely affecting front line prosecution services.  As a result, he has been able to meet an increase in the volume and complexity of his workload over the past two years without having to increase overall staff numbers, although, as I said, he has increased the number of front line staff as a ratio of the total number in his employment.  He has intimated to the Department that there are no staffing issues in regard to his office at this time.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Olwyn Enright</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the new responsibilities allocated to his Department, including details of its responsibility to provide a cohesive system for unemployment to retraining and jobs; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[15642/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the recently announced changes in ministerial responsibility, the employment and community services programmes of F&Aacute;S are being transferred to my Department, the community services programme and the rural social scheme are transferring from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and responsibility for the payment of redundancy and insolvency payments is transferring from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>The process of transferring functions from one Department to another is carried out by means of Government orders.  Each order needs to be carefully drafted so that all relevant legislation is listed in the Schedule to the order.  The Departments which currently hold the functions that are being transferred to my Department are fully engaged in this task at present.  The draft orders will need to be finalised and settled in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel before they can be brought to Government.</P>
        <P>Once this process has been finalised, the Minister for Finance will bring the necessary orders to Government.  At this stage, I cannot give a precise date for the formal transfer of functions as this depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of the legislation governing the particular functions.  I assure the Deputy that everyone involved in the process, both in my Department and in the other Departments concerned, is making every effort to complete it at the earliest possible date and I hope that it can be brought to conclusion within a matter of weeks.  While the primary responsibility for job creation rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, my Department already has a role in supporting people from welfare to work.  The national employment action plan is the main activation measure for jobseekers and provides for a systematic engagement of the employment services with unemployed people.</P>
        <P>Overall, the transfer of functions being implemented will facilitate the delivery of a more effective and streamlined response to the needs of the unemployed.  Bringing together, under the aegis of one Department, the employment services of F&Aacute;S, the expertise of its placement officers and the unemployment services of this Department, as well as the community employment schemes, job initiative scheme, community services programme and rural social scheme, will offer significant opportunities to generate synergies, improve efficiency and ultimately improve service delivery to those availing of these services.</P><Col N="393"/>
        <P>The existing level of interaction and co-operation with F&Aacute;S and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will facilitate a seamless transfer of functions when the necessary orders are finalised and the restructuring will provide for greater cohesion of activation measures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this opportunity to wish the Minister well in his new position. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, wish the Minister well in his new portfolio.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, the current Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Mary Hanafin, indicated that she did not mind being removed from her previous portfolio because the Department&rsquo;s policy functions had been removed.  I am paraphrasing rather than quoting the Minister directly but that was the import of her words.  Will the Minister confirm that his Department will continue to have a policy function, specifically in the area of creating employment opportunities?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister used the word &ldquo;seamless&rdquo; in connection with F&Aacute;S.  No one in the House would describe F&Aacute;S as a seamless organisation.  I am concerned by the decision to divide the organisation&rsquo;s function among three Departments.  Will the Minister provide further detail on exactly how this will work, in particular, on the ground in local F&Aacute;S offices?  At present, a person visiting a local office will find the community section and employment officer in the same place and the training function elsewhere.  Will this continue to be the case?  While the director general of F&Aacute;S has ultimate responsibility, will three F&Aacute;S officials be answerable to the three responsible Ministers or will only one official be answerable to all three Ministers?</P>
        <P>The Minister stated everything will come together.  Will the 59 facilitators operating in the Department come under the remit of F&Aacute;S or continue to operate independently?  While we all want seamless operations, I am not convinced that will be the outcome of the proposed changes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Currently, a person who signs on as unemployed signs up for a payment and then visits his or her local F&Aacute;S office seeking activation placements and so forth.  The Department&rsquo;s aim, which makes a great deal of sense, is to ensure that when a person visits his or her local social welfare office, the officials who deal with placement will be working side by side with those dealing with payments.  There are two sides to unemployment.  While the income issue is important, we have not stressed the debilitating effect of unemployment on those affected by it.  The objective, therefore, is to have a one-stop-shop.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked whether the Department will have a policymaking role.  The Department will make all policy in this realm.  The only policy element being moved elsewhere is the national social inclusion policy which is transferring, with the family functions, to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The Department will continue to feed into that process, although the lead Department will be the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Policy on all activation and social welfare issues as well as community schemes and so forth will be made in my Department.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked how the proposals will work.  For years, I have argued that enforced idleness is not a great policy.  We spend &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion annually on unemployment payments and a further &euro;500 million on activation.  My Department, rather than two Departments, will treat this money as one pot.  I want to use activation measures to differentiate between those who are genuinely unemployed and those who may not be genuinely unemployed and use savings arising from this approach to create more activation and opportunities for people to be gainfully involved in community work and so on.   That is the where the big <Col N="394"/>change will come about.  Having all the money in one place will make a radical difference in that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>We would all like to see greater activation.  It would have been better if the training section was within the Department itself, but that is for another day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the F&Aacute;S staff currently based in local F&Aacute;S offices now be placed in local social welfare offices?  If that is the case, will they retain the status of public servant or will they become civil servants, as they would be in the Department of Social and Family Affairs?  F&Aacute;S staff were supposed to be moved to Birr, but it was hard to move them, so I do not envy the Minister in trying to get them to move to social welfare offices around the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy previously asked who was in charge as long as F&Aacute;S exists.  The best analogy on how this can work is with Pobail.  The responsibility for this body was with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, in which I served in a previous administrative role.  However, many different Departments use Pobail to deliver schemes on their behalf under service level agreements.  Similarly, primary responsibility for corporate governance in F&Aacute;S will transfer to the Department of Education and Science, but there is no difficulty in the short term in having an agreement between my Department and F&Aacute;S to deliver services on a contract basis through activation.  Decisions on CE schemes and so on will not pose insurmountable difficulties.  There are good working models on how to do that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy rightly highlighted the next stage, which is the challenge of getting from where we are to where we would like to be.  There are industrial relations issues and we will work on these gradually.  On a practical level, we must have greater interaction between those working on the payment side of unemployment and the people who are working with the activation.  After three months, about 60% of people have moved back into employment.  After one year, it has dropped to about 30%.  It is at that juncture where we have to try to move people into some kind of activity rather than having them drawing money for a long time with nothing to do.  One of the big things that genuinely unemployed people complain about is the forced inactivity.  I will try to tackle that problem as quickly as I can.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to offset the impact on poor households of the full introduction of the carbon levy; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[15648/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has announced its intention to introduce a carbon tax, which will come into effect on heating products from May 2010 and on solid fuels at a date to be set by commencement order.  Before the tax is applied to fuels for home heating, arrangements are being made to assist those most at risk of fuel poverty.  In his carbon budget statement, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, outlined details of &euro;130 million in funding for insulation, &euro;76 million of which will be used to assist low income families.</P>
        <P>The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio and has convened an interdepartmental and inter-agency group on affordable energy to co-ordinate and drive Government policy in this area.  The interdepartmental and inter-agency group has been asked to draw up an energy affordability strategy.  This strategy will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability and will have regard both to the impact of the carbon tax on low income households and the range of supports outlined above in making its recommendations.  The group will make <Col N="395"/>recommendations on the precise package of measures, including in the area of income support, that should be put in place to assist those at risk of fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the Department of Social and Family Affairs will continue to assist social welfare recipients with heating costs both through their basic payments, through the fuel allowance and through the household benefits package of electricity and gas allowances.  These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.</P>
<P el="10"> <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P el="0">Proper household insulation is absolutely vital in tackling fuel poverty.  Initiatives such as the warmer homes scheme, operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, have a very valuable role to play in that regard, as does funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to improve the quality of existing local authority housing and the housing adaptation grants for older people and for people with disabilities.  Considerable progress has been made in this area in recent years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I wish him well.  It is an important Department and I hope he has a successful tenure there.</P>
        <P>My question was about a vouched fuel scheme that was promised in the budget.  To which fuels will that scheme apply and when will it be announced?  In ten days time, the 300,000 families living in fuel poverty will be hit with a double financial whammy.  They will lose the fuel allowance at the end of April and will be at least &euro;20 per week worse off because of that, but the carbon levy then kicks in the next day.  When will the Minister come up with a new scheme to compensate for the increased cost of the carbon levy and to which fuels will it apply?  Many families will be dependent on that new scheme to get them by and to ensure they have adequate heating.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, a group is working on this issue and it is intended that it will come forward with recommendations.  I am more than aware of the time constraints we face, and I will try to see if we can implement something fast for those who face challenges.  However, I have not been given the proposals yet.</P>
        <P>The fuel issue becomes much more critical during the cold winter months than it does just before summer, but I am aware of the challenge.  For those us who have gone from house to house, a major problem is that of poor insulation, particularly in houses belonging to older people.  Some houses are in poor condition, whether they are local authority houses or privately owned houses.  The ultimate answer to this question is to look at the energy rating of these houses and at various schemes such as the warmer homes scheme.  This goes back to whether we can activate people to do this work.  Some very good work has been done in certain parts of the country through schemes that provide insulation.  This cuts down on the amount of heating used and means that not only would the carbon levy not have any effect, but it also means a dramatic cut in the cost of heating by making the houses warmer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever about the long term, what will the Minister do in ten days when poor families lose the fuel allowance and are faced with a huge increase in the cost of home heating oil?  It is cold comfort for those people when the Minister says he is aware of the challenge and that there is a group working on the issue.  That is not acceptable.  A scheme was announced by the Government in December&rsquo;s budget.  The Minister knew then that the carbon levy was coming in on 1 May and that the fuel allowance was being cut at the end of April.  What will he do for those families in ten days&rsquo; time?</P><Col N="396"/>
        <P>The Minister must come up with a scheme.  Does he realise that the cost of home heating oil increased by 38% last year and by 5% in the last month alone?  The Minister has prided himself on being the voice of rural Ireland.  Many low income families in rural Ireland are particularly dependent on home heating oil.  Given the huge increases in the cost of such oil in the last year and the fact that many low income families will be hit with this double whammy in ten days, will the Minister do anything to relieve their situation?  If he will not do anything, then he is dreadfully out of touch with what is happening to poor families.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The simple answer is that the recommendations are to be made available before the implementation of the carbon tax.  Since I do not have the recommendations, I cannot go beyond that today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 300,000 families who are in receipt of the fuel allowance.  That will run out because they will have access to the allowance for only one more week.  The following day the carbon levy will become operative.  There will be an 8% to 9% increase in the cost of home heating oil.  I am asking the Minister to give an undertaking that the new scheme to offset the additional financial burden that will be imposed on poor families will be in place by 1 May.  Can the Minister give that guarantee now, as promised earlier? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is going to learn one thing about me, that is, when I am ready to make a decision I will make it.  Nobody will force me into making a decision before I am ready.  As I said, I have not got the recommendations and therefore I cannot answer the question at this time.  Therefore, the Deputy cannot say whether or not I am going to, because I have not said so.  The Deputy will have to be patient.  I am more than concerned, and not only about this.  The big issue, as the Deputy has rightly pointed out, is not the carbon tax, because the price of home heating oil has gone up way beyond what the carbon tax would have done.  There is a huge issue there, if the Deputy is really concerned about fuel poverty.  Even if there was never a carbon tax &mdash; which the Deputy seems to think is the totality of this challenge &mdash; the real problem is lack of insulation in people&rsquo;s houses.  If we are really concerned about the disadvantaged and about the people who are suffering from fuel poverty, the first and biggest thing to tackle is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>With respect, the real problem will be obvious on 1 May when people will not be able to afford to heat their homes.  I am asking the Minister, who has responsibility for social protection, if he has any plans to introduce a new scheme, as promised, which would be available before the carbon levy comes in on 1 May. </P>

        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest> the impact current industrial action is having on applications for social welfare support; the number of social welfare claims delayed as a result of this action; his plans to address this backlog; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[15643/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The overall response to the industrial action is being managed centrally by the Department of Finance with input from all Government Departments, including the Department, and other public service sectors.  The industrial action is being closely monitored in the Department on a daily basis and the Department&rsquo;s management is maintaining contacts with the unions concerned to ensure, in so far as possible, that the negative impact on the Department&rsquo;s customers is minimised.</P>
        <P>In the main, the industrial action in the Department resulted in telephones not being answered, counter services in public offices not being provided for various periods, certain statistical work returns not being completed, and certain computer systems not being used.  A ban on overtime was introduced in the illness benefit area from 22 February 2010 and this ban <Col N="400"/>was extended to other areas of the Department for four weeks from 15 March to 9 April.  This and other actions resulted in a delay of one or two days in issuing payment to the customers affected.  While the number of illness benefit claims awaiting a decision has stayed broadly the same at about 6,800 over this period, there was an increase in the time taken to process the claims from about six days to an average of eight days during the period of the industrial action.</P>
        <P>In some areas, staff not answering phones or attending the public counters worked on processing claims and, as a result, backlogs were reduced and processing times improved as these staff were diverted.  Consequently, there is no backlog of claims that can be directly attributed to the industrial action.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputies will be aware that there have been significant arrears of jobseekers&rsquo; claims over the past 18 months or so due to the huge influx of applications for these schemes.  However, the number of claims awaiting a decision has been declining every week since the end of January, when they stood at over 62,000 and were reduced to 47,500 at week ending 27 March.  The number increased to 52,800 after the Easter break.  However, this is normal as there is always a significant increase in claims from school-related workers around any school holiday period.  This, combined with the impact of the shorter working weeks at this time has resulted in an increase in the number of jobseeker claims awaiting a decision.</P>
        <P>Overall, the number of jobseeker claims awaiting a decision expressed as a percentage of the entire claim-load nationally is now at about 10%.  This is the level of claims awaiting a decision that applied even when the live register was at its lowest.  In some local offices the percentage of claim awaiting a decision is higher, but we are working to bring them in line with the national average as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The work to rule is ongoing.  However, following recent discussions between the unions and the Department of Finance, there has been some relaxation of the industrial action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>For almost two years we have been hearing of problems in some local offices.  I and other colleagues have had dealings with the people working in those offices and they want to know when a solution will be found.  The problem affects approximately 17 local offices.  Delays in these offices are higher than anywhere else.  Is there any sign of a resolution to the problem?  We have been told several times it is also an industrial relations problem, even before the work to rule or the overtime ban.  In the context of the current negotiations, will that issue also be dealt with so that those people who have no choice but to go to their local office for payment will be dealt with in the same manner as those in any other office?</P>
        <P>I am glad to hear that some good has come as a result of the current action and that backlogs have been cleared.  I had expected to hear the Minister say the backlog was even greater, but welcome the fact that is not the case.  Can the Minister learn anything from this in terms of the operation of the offices and the Department, because when those in the offices can concentrate on claims, they get through more work?  I do not suggest they should not answer telephones, but could staff be divided so as to work more effectively?  Some people could be responsible for taking queries and others could work full-time on applications.  That could speed up the process.  The staff in the office receive queries from Members of the Houses and the public, but if the backlog was cleared, there would not be as many queries.  Many of the queries relate to the delay.  Is the Minister aware of anything that should be changed as a result of the situation over the past number of weeks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Members experience delays across a range of services.  These delays cause grief for people and are a huge challenge in any system.  In my previous Department, I <Col N="401"/>tried to minimise delays in making decisions across the range of the operation of the Department and discovered, as the Deputy suggested, that the number of queries decreased the more we reduced the list or queue.  This led to even more work being done.  Queues take up a significant amount of staff time.  </P>
        <P>There are two elements to running any Department, policy and operation.  Day-to-day operation is a matter for the staff of the Department, but the Minister has a responsibility to examine the schemes to see how things can be streamlined and to ensure we do not have inordinate queues at every facet.  This applies to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and other schemes.  I have no doubt but that there will be co-operation in making the changes.  Some schemes require more time.  For example, because there is no means test for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, it is much quicker to obtain it than jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  We have to deal with the complexities of all of the different types of means tests for the different schemes.  I will examine everything, <i>de novo</i>, across the Department to see if we can streamline the processes more to provide better delivery to customers.</P>
        <P>I have dealt with the Department of Social and Family Affairs over many years and have always found its staff helpful and co-operative.  When customers ring them, they genuinely try to help them and it has generally been a customer-centred Department.  We must examine the procedures and see whether it is easy for the staff to deliver a good service or whether there are crinkles in the system we could eliminate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister that the staff are helpful.  The executive council of the CPSU has rejected the public sector pay deal and prior to Easter, we had a discussion in the House on the Order of Business with regard to contingency plans in the Department.  Has the Minister considered contingency plans in the event of action being escalated and social welfare offices across the country being affected?  I do not want to see a situation arise where people cannot get their payments or their applications processed because of an escalation in action.  We have seen the difficulties that arose in the Passport Office.  There were also temporary difficulties when some of the social welfare offices were closed.  This is something about which people are concerned and which could get out of control.  The previous Minister had not considered contingency plans, but is the current Minister doing so?  He needs to have some plan in place rather than having to react on the day if action affects offices.  Is he preparing a contingency plan?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Generally, where the industrial action has discommoded people, the unions have taken a responsible attitude and recognised that the people served by my Department are the most vulnerable.  We will continue to work to try and minimise the disruption to people, but this is also contingent on getting co-operation from the staff and unions, something which has been given.  Low-level action has taken place that has disrupted some areas and there was a slight delay in payment, but generally the unions have taken a responsible attitude.  I hope they continue to do so.  We may have and there are contingency plans, but they can only operate at a certain level.  Everybody must try and work together to resolve the issues.  As noted, the executive of the union has given its view, but it is up to the members of the union to balance everything and make their views known.  The Government feels strongly that what is on offer is the best balance that can be given at this time.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Olwyn Enright</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the number of defined benefit pension schemes which fail the minimum funding standard; the number of persons affected by this; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[15644/10]</QRef>
      </Qst><Col N="402"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Pensions Act, defined benefit pension schemes must meet a minimum funding standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge their accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up.  Where schemes do not satisfy the funding standard, the sponsors or trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years, although as part of temporary measures announced by the Government, the Pensions Board can now allow a scheme ten years or more to meet the standard in certain circumstances. </P>
        <P>At the end of 2009, there were 254,325 members in 1,192 defined benefit schemes subject to the funding standard.  It is estimated that approximately 75% of these schemes are in deficit.  However, the extent of the level of under-funding will not be fully apparent until all schemes carry out their next actuarial assessment and report the results to the Pensions Board.</P>
        <P>The Government is conscious of the pressures on both sponsoring employers and pension scheme trustees, arising from the very significant losses incurred by pension funds during 2007 and 2008.  While schemes recovered some of their losses in the last year, we are anxious to ensure, in so far as we can, that those involved have sufficient time and space to fully assess the implications for their schemes and the remedial action they can take.  This was the thinking behind the implementation of a number of measures, in December 2008, to ease the pressures being felt by many pension funds.  Those measures included the granting of extra time for schemes to formulate funding proposals and allowing longer periods for recovery plans.  Just this week, the Pensions Regulator announced an extension of the deadline for submission of funding proposals for those due to submit before 30 June next by five months, to 30 November 2010.  This extension will allow schemes to take into account the recently implemented Occupational Pension Schemes (Preservation of Benefits) (Amendment) Regulations 2010.  These regulations permit schemes to increase the pension scheme&rsquo;s normal retirement age by way of an application under section 50 of the Pensions Act with immediate and retroactive effect.  The extension will also allow scheme trustees and employers to consider the effect of the proposed changes in the national pensions framework.</P>

        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P el="0">Furthermore, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009 amended the Pensions Act to allow for the restructuring of underfunded schemes, to ensure a more equitable distribution of assets in the event of the wind-up of a defined benefit scheme and to strengthen the powers of the Pensions Board in ensuring that pension contributions deducted from wages and salaries are remitted by employers to scheme trustees.  This Act also introduced the legislative provisions to enable the Minister for Finance to establish the pensions insolvency payments scheme, PIPS, to reduce the cost of purchasing pension payments for trustees of pension schemes where the employer has become insolvent.  The PIPS came into effect in February 2010 and will ensure a more equitable distribution of assets following the wind up of underfunded pension schemes.</P>
        <P>Other options relating to the future development of pensions policy are outlined in the recently published national pensions framework.  The implementation group, charged with developing the legislative, regulatory and administrative structures will hold its first meeting in May.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The national pensions framework has been published and we will have the opportunity to discuss it in more detail at the Select Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs tomorrow.  Does the Minister propose to try to adopt what is in the framework in a cohesive, all-encompassing way or does he propose to make changes on a budgetary basis year in and out as has been done in the previous two budgets with schemes such as PIPS?  I put this question because of the lack of security workers feel they have with regard to the <Col N="403"/>pensions they expect to receive but which in many cases they will not realise.  The reason I asked this question is that a legal action is being brought against the State by workers in Waterford Crystal, of which I am sure the Minister is aware.  They allege the State manifestly disregarded its obligations under Directive 80/987/EEC which deals with insolvency.  Deputy Shortall questioned the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors on this in the House.  The workers in Waterford Crystal quote the Robins case in the UK and argue that had we transposed the directive properly they would at least have received a far bigger percentage than they are receiving under the current arrangements.  I presume the State will defend that action.  What answer will the Minister give us in the House on the allegation made?  The workers are making this allegation now but it was made in the House previously and was not adequately responded to by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister can answer on the generality.  Has he taken into account the judgment in the Robins case in the UK which gives the impression that the Waterford Crystal workers should be entitled to a greater share than they are receiving?  Those staff feel utterly abandoned.  They have received no support.  Changes were made to the pensions legislation at that time which utterly ignored the situation in which they found themselves.  They did not come out any better as a result.  I will ask the Minister specific questions on the directive.  Does he believe the directive has been adequately transposed and that he will win the case?  There seems to be very strong evidence that he will not and that he will put the country to enormous expense and that the result will not be as he expects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I can answer the general question.  A report from the Commission on 15 June 1995 analysing national laws transposing the directive found that in the case of Ireland there was no cause for objection.  The Commission found that all of these provisions appear to meet the requirements of Article 8.  Following the ruling in the Robins case, the Commission published a working document in April 2008 which essentially described how each member state had transposed the directive.  It did not assess the conformity of the measures in place with the obligations imposed by Article 8 of the directive.  It concluded that further investigation is needed to address how to protect employees and retired persons against the risk of underfunding of pension schemes and to what extent; how to guarantee any unpaid contributions to the pension schemes; and how to deal with cases where supplementary pension schemes are managed by the employers themselves.  The Department is awaiting the outcome of this investigation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the outcome of that investigation be made available?  Time and again in the House we hear that we are awaiting an outcome.  A report was done on FIS, on which I asked a question, and we are still awaiting the outcome of that.  Outcomes are what we are meant to be about here but we do not seem to know.  The duty under Article 8 of <Col N="404"/>the directive is to protect employees in insolvency situations.  Getting 20% of the pension one paid into and expected to receive is not a protection.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to introduce a partial capacity benefit scheme for people in receipt of illness or disability payments; the details of the way in which this scheme will operate; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Work on draft proposals for a partial capacity scheme is currently under way in my Department.    The Deputy will be aware that the structure of welfare provision in Ireland for people with illnesses or disabilities reflects a view that people can be categorised as being either capable of full-time work or incapable of full-time work.  The fact is that a strict binary approach fails to capture the reality that people with a disability may have the capacity to engage in the open labour market.  While partial employment capacity may be difficult to assess, the absence of such a system means that people with substantial work capacity may exit the labour market prematurely.</P>
        <P>As has been noted by the OECD in its report on &ldquo;Sickness, Disability and Work: Breaking the Barriers&rdquo;, which examined the structures of welfare provision for people with disabilities in Ireland and in a number of other OECD countries, the focus within welfare systems on incapacity rather than capacity carries negative consequences at a personal level for people with disabilities and their families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the theory behind this idea and it is important.  The present system whereby a person gets permission from the Department to do 20 hours, work for a year or up to three years and then that permission is suddenly removed is not ideal.  Some people can do only approximately 20 hours or part-time work.  Will there be an element of compulsion in the scheme or will it be voluntary?  Assuming it is a success, people return to employment and savings to the Exchequer are made, how will those savings be used?  I was not convinced by the earlier answer on F&Aacute;S but I suggest we still need to build up the facilitation service that exists, particularly for those with disabilities.</P>
        <P>I tabled this question with regard to people with mental health difficulties in particular.  I have spoken to Amnesty International about this and I feel there is a real difficulty in the assessment of mental health under the structure for the disability payment at present.  People with genuine mental health difficulties find it more difficult to prove their cases than a person who walks in with a physical difficulty.  This problem needs to be addressed.  Suggestions have been made that there should be stronger liaison between the Department and community mental health teams and GPs with regard to people with mental health issues.  When will it happen and will the Minister consider beefing up the service to assist those people?  If they are to try to go back to work they will need supports to enable them to do so.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="405"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department is very keen to proceed with this.  When they came to me they were all very anxious with regard to timeframes.  I would like to see the draft scheme first.  No more than what I stated to Deputy Shortall earlier, I like to see what I am being presented with as a Minister prior to jumping in to make a decision.  The principle is simple and I do not think anyone could argue with it.  However, the practicality and the detail &mdash; often the devil is in the detail &mdash; are where I see the challenges.  Many people on illness benefit might feel threatened that they would receive only a half payment or a quarter payment.  However, many others in the working economy might &mdash; if I may put it bluntly &mdash; see an opportunity here.  I would like to see the scheme and then have an open debate with Deputies to examine it from every angle to ensure we are doing the right thing by people who genuinely have a disability.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Enright pointed out, all of us have faced huge challenges with regard to illness claims in constituency clinics because two people could have the same disability but depending on one&rsquo;s job, education and capacity, one&rsquo;s ability to find employment might be very different from that of another person.  This is where it gets complex.  I would like to move forward with this but I do not want unintended consequences arising.  I am more than willing to engage with Deputies, and perhaps through the committee would be best in order that we can tease out the best way forward.  The Department proposed to me that we do it in the form of the Bill.  I am not convinced that we should not do so prior to the Bill and give it time to get the best results for those with a disability and to have a scheme to deal with the problems of the existing system, which I do not think is satisfactory.  A person receives permission to work 20 hours a week and inevitably it is rehabilitative but often it is not rehabilitative in getting that person back into full employment because he or she will never have the capacity for full employment.  I do not think I can tease out the details of the challenges I see in it in the House today but I am more than willing to engage with Deputy Enright on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that.  In the proposals put to the Minister by the Department how was the scheme thought up?  Was it devised as a mechanism to save money from illness benefit payments or was it devised as a mechanism to assist people to get back into the workforce?  There is a big difference between them.  The thought process behind it could inform us very much prior to the next debate.  Does the Minister have a timetable for the introduction of the scheme?  There were suggestions from the Department of a pilot project.  Has any progress been made in that regard?  What would be the practicalities of that?</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>There was talk about putting it into legislation, starting from the beginning of next year.  I have not seen the detail; the devil is always in the detail of these things.  The concept is fine.  I am not going to commit myself here to doing that because I will not introduce a scheme unless I believe it is robust.  I understand the idea of the scheme is to facilitate participation in the workforce by those with a partial capacity who might at the moment find it very difficult to participate in the workforce.  There is no expectation in the Department of major savings from this scheme.  I hope to get the scheme in the very near future and that we would have an opportunity to discuss it and review it from every angle.  I am sure there will be a significant input from people like the Deputy who have knowledge of this area to ensure we do not rush headlong into a scheme that does not work.  On the other hand I do not want to delay matters indefinitely.  I will be pressing that I will get the scheme very soon.  I will review it and make my comments.  I will be robust in my critique of it.  We can then look at the best way to tease out how such a scheme might work.  Sometimes schemes are introduced with one view and operate very differently on the ground because people see them in a different way from the way that the person who designed the scheme thought they would see them.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the number of families eligible for the family income supplement; the number of families in receipt of the family income supplement; if he is concerned about the low uptake of the family income supplement; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[15454/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The family income supplement is designed to provide support for people with families who are on low earnings.  This preserves the incentive for them to remain in employment in circumstances where they might only be marginally better off than if they were claiming other social welfare payments.  FIS is a central element of a strategy targeted specifically at addressing child poverty.</P>
        <P>The Department has consistently publicised the FIS scheme in order to maximise uptake by qualified families.  Significant improvements in the qualifying income limits and ongoing awareness campaigns have resulted in a strong upward trend in the level of new and renewal claims.  Some 25,956 people are in receipt of a weekly FIS payment.  In 2009, more than 46,258 new and renewal claims were received compared to 42,940 in 2008 and 36,900 in 2007.  In 2010, some 14,088 new and renewal claims have been received to date compared to 14,646 in the same period last year.</P>
        <P>The Department undertakes a number of measures to ensure that people are aware of possible entitlement to FIS.  These include the publication of information on FIS on the Department&rsquo;s website, making information available through the citizen&rsquo;s information service and through the Department&rsquo;s network of local offices.  Furthermore, an extensive advertising campaign for FIS was conducted in 2006.</P>
        <P>With regard to the level of uptake, it is not possible to estimate from administrative sources the number of families who would be eligible but do not apply for their FIS entitlements.  In this regard, the Department commissioned a research project in 2008 to examine factors behind the level of uptake for the scheme.  The research found that overall awareness of family income supplement among potential recipients is high with almost three in four claiming to have heard of the scheme.  Despite high levels of awareness, there was a lack of awareness and understanding of the eligibility requirements with only one in three claiming to be aware of the qualifying criteria for FIS.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report recommends that the Department ensure that information about the scheme is advertised in a focused way with the eligibility and qualification criteria communicated as clearly as possible.  The Department is addressing this by ensuring such information is highlighted as part of its ongoing publicity and advertisement campaigns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>What changes have been made in advertising since the report was given to the Department?  When was the report made available?  I do not believe it has been published.  Perhaps the Minister might let us have a copy of it.  FIS was to have been the saviour for people on low incomes who had their child benefit payments reduced in the budget.  How many people became eligible for FIS as a result of the changes in the child benefit payment?</P>
        <P>For some time I have tried to get to the bottom of how many people should be eligible for FIS but have not made much progress.  When the concept of FIS was first raised, surely the Department carried out a study to ascertain approximately how much it would cost us.  Surely there was an estimate at that time of the numbers of people who might be eligible for FIS. <Col N="407"/> With the possible exception of the farm waste management scheme, generally it would not be possible to set up a scheme without knowing how many people might be likely to apply.  Some information must exist as to the total number of people who should be eligible for FIS.  That information should be available from the Department or the Revenue Commissioners.  If people are eligible, they should be made aware of it and get the supplement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2006, some &euro;272,000 was spent on an advertising campaign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>That was prior to the report that suggested it needed more advertising.  I am not suggesting television and newspaper advertisements.  I am referring to contacting people through the social welfare offices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I can never get my head around this matter.  I do not know how many people are eligible.  I do not know if there is any way to find that out.  Presumably the nearest we would get to it would be through an assessment through, for example, a labour force survey.  It depends on household income which requires knowing both incomes of a couple to do the calculation.  We must try to ensure that people know they are entitled to it.  The concept is very good because it keeps those on low incomes in work.  It means that people who do not have a full week&rsquo;s work are entitled to FIS.  That is much more attractive than having such people on the live register.  I will certainly review all these schemes to ascertain how we can make work attractive for families.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about child benefit.  To my memory, child benefit is not included in the assessment and never was.  Therefore, the change in child benefit will not change eligibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>At the time when families on low incomes had their child benefit payment reduced, the Minister said they would be able to get FIS in order to balance things out and help them not to feel the pain as much.  People have found that it has not made any great change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>If my memory serves me right, the amount of money was increased by increasing the level.  It is 60% of the difference between a person&rsquo;s income as assessed and the guide income.  The way to increase FIS is by increasing the guide income.  Therefore, it should have potentially made more people eligible for FIS.  That is a fact. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>In addition, for people already in receipt of FIS, following the increase in the threshold income, if their incomes stay the same, 60% of a higher threshold also increases by the same amount. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>(<b>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor):</b> I am anxious to let Deputy Shortall in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>We all agree with the concept of FIS.  However, the scheme is just not working at present.  The Minister could do worse than making the reform of FIS his first priority in his new role.  At the moment there is a serious problem with the incentive to work <Col N="408"/>for families, especially those with young children given that the early child care supplement has been halved.  The Minister talked about FIS being increased.  While it has been increased, that was only done to compensate for the cuts in child benefit; there has been no net increase.  The Minister&rsquo;s priority should be that as far as possible individuals and families are facilitated in moving from welfare to work.  Does the Minister accept that he should make the reform of family income supplement a priority?</P>
        <P>FIS has numerous problems.  The way the self-employed are treated is ridiculous.  It makes no sense that self-employed people are excluded.  The 19-hour rule makes no sense and represents a disincentive for people to work.  There is no allowance for typical family costs as applies with eligibility for a medical card, including the cost of child care and the cost of participating in work, such as transport and so on.  In addition, there are very strict regulations in regard to the length of time the job must be available.  All of these issues are placing barriers in the way of people who want to work.  Will the Minister make it a priority to ensure that those barriers are removed and, as it operates in an archaic way at present, that FIS is modernised and made fit for purpose for current issues in order to assist as many people as possible to move from welfare to work?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Moving people from welfare to work has been a life&rsquo;s mission with me, and I have done quite a bit of it in my time, long before I entered this House during which I got a very good knowledge of the social welfare system.  As a young person going to work and creating employment in a community co-operative, I was appalled to find out how penal the social welfare system was given that, growing up, I had no personal dealings with it.  I was appalled to find that every euro earned in self-employment took a euro off a person&rsquo;s social welfare income.  Since I found that out many years ago as a young person, I have been determined to try to change it.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy I would be more than interested in discussing ways to address this issue, not only in regard to FIS but also in regard to social welfare interaction with self-employed people.  While I am not sure that FIS as we know it is the best model in that case, I am more than willing to debate that with the Deputy.</P>

I would look forward to invitations from the committee and we can spend afternoons going through this in detail.  Members will find me very open to ideas and suggestions as to how we can improve all of these schemes.</P>
        <P>There are huge limitations with regard to finance but I believe we can spend the existing money in a much more constructive way that will create the incentive to do things rather than, as social welfare has often worked in the past, being a total disincentive to activity.

        <P>Will the Minister attempt to get the figures in regard to the number of people who should be eligible for FIS?  He can work with the Revenue Commissioners to examine the details of the scheme.  When it was set up, somebody must have tried to examine the number of people who were eligible because it would be irresponsible to set up a scheme without knowing how many people would be eligible for it.  Will he commit to trying to do that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult but, if it is possible to get the information I will do so.  I have no problem giving information but there are many difficulties in accessing it accurately.  There always seems to be a perception that there is an under-claiming of FIS.  Again, I do not know the exact explanation for that and whether we can get to the bottom of it.  Huge improvements have been made in the social welfare system in the past 20 years.</P>

It is about collective Government; it is not about one-person Government.  There have been huge improvements, particularly in terms of rates and schemes.  The Labour Party was in Government, as was Fine Gael.  As Deputy Shortall noted, there is a problem of disincentive to activity rather than incentive in many schemes.

	<P Just="Left">On 30 March, the Minister for Finance, in speaking in the House on the financial crisis, said that the banks of this country had played fast and loose with the economic interests of Ireland.  He went on to say that senior people in banking had made appalling lending decisions for which, in his words, the taxpayer would have to pay for years to come.  We now have the revelations from the Irish Nationwide Building Society and the comment by the new chief executive that its reckless lending practices were outrageous, resulting in losses of &euro;2.5 billion last year and 120% mortgages given out, with no guarantees sought in many cases.  This appalling behaviour and light touch regulation was overseen when the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, was Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Bank of Ireland published a report last week.  This bank is a covered institution which has been the recipient of &euro;3.5 billion from the Irish taxpayer to date, and the transfer to NAMA will be of the order of &euro;12 billion in respect of loans.  In the report last week, this bank agreed, proposed and approved a top-up pension payment of &euro;1.9 million for the chief executive.  The chief executive in this case is not a new entity; he was an insider who came from Ulster Bank and who led the charge for a vigorous property development process within Bank of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance has said senior people in banking circles in Ireland made appalling lending decisions.  I pointed out to the Taoiseach in the House previously that, under section 50 of the guarantee scheme, where this scheme is being brought into disrepute, the Minister for Finance may require certain obligations of the scheme to be adhered to and he may specify <Col N="410"/>in writing to the covered institution in question what those obligations might be.  Hundreds of thousands of people in our country are out of work and many thousands, as we speak, are scrabbling to put the few cent together to meet the increased rate in variable mortgage repayments, yet we have a situation where Bank of Ireland, a covered institution, has approved a &euro;1.9 million top-up in pension for its chief executive and the Taoiseach and his Government stand idly by, despite the fact the Minister for Finance said that senior bankers had made appalling lending decisions.</P>
        <P>At a time of economic crisis for many thousands of our people, is the Taoiseach happy that Bank of Ireland approves a &euro;1.9 million top-up for its chief executive?  Is he prepared to invoke the section of the guarantee scheme which gives the Minister for Finance authority from Government and in law to intervene, specify in writing and have this decision reversed?  Is he happy to sit idly by in the knowledge that he can intervene and can have this reversed on the instruction of the Minister for Finance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have set up a banking inquiry to look into all issues related to lending practices and other things that have been happening in the retail banking sector and the building society sector.  That will be dealt with as we set it out and that is the place where we can deal with all of those issues.</P>
        <P>On the specific matter of the Bank of Ireland, the facts of the situation as I understand them are that a &euro;1.49 million contribution was made by the bank to the Bank of Ireland pension fund and was not made to Mr. Boucher personally.</P>

It is a payment that is being made to the bank staff pension fund to sustain the agreed pension of the chief executive, a pension based on his salary, that is now controlled by the Government under the Covered Institutions Remuneration Oversight Committee.  The payment is into the pension fund because, unlike public service pensions, it must be pre-funded and is to cover the contractual arrangements, allowing Mr. Boucher to retire when he is due to retire.  This payment is as required.  Contrary to speculation, it does not undermine the salary cap imposed by Government on the sector&rsquo;s executives and directors of the covered financial institutions that was introduced by Government last year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The subscription agreement for recapitalisation provided that no pension enhancements would be awarded without prior consent.  This is not an enhancement but the ongoing application of existing rules for chief executive officers.  The oversight committee recommended pension arrangements for senior staff in the Bank of Ireland should be broadly similar to those for the generality of its staff and a significant review of the overall scheme is under way at present.  Those are the facts of the matter in that situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The salary was capped at a very well-remunerated level, although it is less than what the gentleman was on when he was head of retail banking.  I do not hold any brief for that; I am explaining that the portrayal of this as a direct payment to Mr. Boucher is incorrect.  It is a payment to the pension fund to ensure the pension already agreed under his contract is paid, as with other pensions in that fund for staff.</P>

	<P>That reply is a complete and utter whitewash and the Taoiseach knows it.  The Covered Institutions Remuneration Oversight Committee, which was set up by the Government and reported on 27 February 2009, warned the Government of what could happen here.  Its report contained the following:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">We consider that pension arrangements for top management should be reviewed. We have become aware of a practice in which cash allowances were paid to compensate for the effects of the &ldquo;pensions cap&rdquo; imposed by the Finance Act 2006.  Pension schemes should reflect public policy and tax law and it is unacceptable that arrangements should be put in place which would be inconsistent with the intent of the relevant legislation.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Taoiseach did not mention that the chief executive in question is getting &euro;123,000 per year as a top-up in addition to what is happening here in respect of his pension.  While the chief executive is receiving this &euro;1.9 million top-up in his pension, the generality of the staff in Bank of Ireland are expected to take pension reductions and the rest of the public are expected to work years longer to pay off the debts of these banks, while thousands of people are scrabbling around to meet the repayments on their mortgages.</P>
        <P>In addition, the oversight committee, set up by the Government for the purpose of advising it, stated: &ldquo;Pension arrangements for senior executives in each institution should... be at least broadly similar to those applicable to the generality of the staff of the institution.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach has acted outrageously here.  At a time of economic crisis, this bank, a covered institution we have put &euro;3.5 billion into, and about which public watchdogs may or may not have reported to the Taoiseach, expects the public to wear a situation where the chief executive gets a top-up of &euro;1.9 million to his pension.  It is outrageous and an affront to every person in this country.  If the Taoiseach has any courage and gumption, he will invoke section 50.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance agreed with these recommendations when he said they were appropriate.  What is appropriate for the Minister for Finance is irrelevant to the Taoiseach when he says he will allow the board to top up the chief executive&rsquo;s pension by this order when the rest of the workforce is expected to take pension reductions and the population at large is expected to bow down under the crucifixion imposed by reckless and, as the Minister for Finance said, appalling lending decisions that the Irish taxpayer will be paying for in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach prepared to intervene and see that this top-up, which amounts to a pay rise, is reversed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The facts of the situation are contrary to how the Deputy is asserting them.  I understand the public perception and I hold no brief for the Bank of Ireland pension fund.  I am just setting out the facts of the situation.</P>
        <P>From the Government&rsquo;s point of view, we have capped the salaries and we have ensured no bonuses are being paid.  There can be no enhancements of pension entitlements relating to existing pension entitlements under the contracts for CEOs in that institution.  It is not a payment to Mr. Boucher directly but a contribution to the Bank of Ireland pension fund to ensure there are sufficient funds in the pension fund to sustain all pensions, including the pension the CEO will receive when he retires.</P>
        <P>I hold no brief; I just want to give the facts of the situation.  I have also stated clearly that the subscription agreement provides for no pension enhancements to be awarded without prior consent.  Since this is not an enhancement, although I can understand the situation, it does not require prior consent so the idea of intervening does not arise in that respect.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach makes it sound as if this top-up to the pension fund is for the bank&rsquo;s porters and tellers.  It arises directly from the change in the contractual arrangements that were made for the chief executive of the bank.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the credit institutions legislation, did the Government or the Minister for Finance approve this top-up arrangement?  Does the Minister for Finance intend to exercise his powers under the credit institutions arrangements whereby it can control these matters?</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the issue whereby 2,000 times the top-up of the chief executive&rsquo;s pension has already been committed to Irish Nationwide Building Society by way of recapitalisation &mdash; &euro;2,700 million.  This building society is transferring &euro;8.7 billion of its loans to NAMA from a total loan book of &euro;10.5 billion.  Yesterday, we were told that the building society incurred losses last year alone of &euro;2.5 billion.  It was giving out 120% loans for property speculation here and in Britain.  This was a building society and its principal job was to give mortgages to people to buy their houses, but it was involved in lending for property speculation that we must all now pay for.</P>
        <P>Whatever might be said about other financial institutions, it was widely known there were problems in Irish Nationwide.  It was well known that bad practices were going on there, with the enrichment of some of the top people in Irish Nationwide arising from those practices.  That was going on for some time before we heard about Lehman Brothers and the bank guarantee that was given on 29 September.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach was Minister for Finance between 2004 and 2008.  During that period did the Financial Regulator, the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the Governor of the Central Bank or anyone in the Department of Finance give him a report or bring to his attention the bad practices that were going on in Irish Nationwide which have now been made public and for which the taxpayer must pay?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Concerning what has arisen in regard to Irish Nationwide, I do not believe it was ever brought to my attention that such a problem existed.  A Building Societies Act was passed in 2006, before which discussions took place about how the legislation would be brought forward but there was no indication of this situation.  This is one of the problems in regard to the regulatory system we have had.  It was received wisdom at the time, in the early part of this decade, that we needed an independent regulatory system that would deal with all such situations.  We had the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland was set up.  The fact is it did not serve its purpose well, as we now see.  The facts are as they are and we must investigate all of that.  Serious questions have to be asked in this regard and they will be asked in the course of the inquiry.  Reports will be before the House at the end of May and subsequently there will be a commission of investigation.  </P>
        <P>Concerning whether it was brought to my attention that this sort of problem existed in Irish Nationwide Building Society the answer is that it certainly was not.  Regarding the other issue reported today, namely, that reports regarding lending practices that were prepared at the time were sent to the regulator which received them in the years in which they were prepared, my understanding is that is not what the present chief executive officer says.  Reports were forwarded recently by the new management to the Financial Regulator, some of which go back to matters that arose in the mid-2000s.  The suggestion this morning, as I understood it, was that there were reports at the time which were handed over to the regulator at the time.  My understanding is that this is not the case; it is not what the chief executive officer said yesterday.  Regardless of that, clearly there were corporate conduct and governance issues that must be addressed and investigated in full and that is the Government&rsquo;s intention.</P><Col N="413"/>
        <P>Regarding the previous question on the Bank of Ireland, I stated already to Deputy Kenny that since the scheme does not involve an enhancement of existing pension provision for chief executive officers no prior consent was required of the Minister in that respect.  We are talking about ensuring that from a trustee&rsquo;s point of view there are sufficient funds in place to meet these pensions in the future.  That is the point I make.</P>

	<P>A final supplementary from Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I find that reply concerning the pension issue remarkable.  As I understand it, the enhanced payment to the pension fund arises directly from the fact that the retirement age of the person in question is to be reduced from 60 to 55.  By any standards, an early retirement arrangement of that kind is generous and, I would think, somewhat exceptional, at a time when the Government is talking about not paying the old age pension to people until they are 67 or 68.  Apparently bank executives are being facilitated to retire at 55 but the Taoiseach says that is not an enhancement of their pension arrangements.  It is extraordinary logic.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Irish Nationwide issue, I find what the Taoiseach said remarkable, namely, that he was not given any report about anything amiss or strange happening in the society, given the fact that in 2006 the Government prepared legislation and brought it to the House one night.  It was at night, the day before the House rose for the summer recess in 2006.  The Government put the legislation through the House in one night, legislation that was tailor-made for the enrichment of Mr. Fingleton.  I find it strange, given that this legislation was introduced by the Government and approved by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance, that he had no report, as he tells the House, from the Financial Regulator or the Registrar of Friendly Societies who had responsibility for building societies, the Governor of the Central Bank, or anybody else, to say that anything was amiss.</P>
        <P>I draw to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention what one Opposition Deputy said in the House that night.  He referred to Deputy Ahern who was then a Minister of State.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Why does the Minister of State appear unconcerned that the management of a building society, which until recently used practices described by an ombudsman ruling as being invalid and unlawful, may be substantially rewarded as a result of the demutualisation process?</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Referring to a particular section, he asked:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">What input did the board of Irish Nationwide have to a particular section of the Bill which is tailored to allow the speedy demutualisation and sale of Irish Nationwide and in the process to enrich the corporate management at the expense of the membership?</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Deputy continued by saying that late the previous year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I ask Deputy Gilmore for a question, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is that these issues could be raised by an Opposition Deputy, issues such as, for example, Irish Nationwide and its management having been, for years, the subject of accusations, some substantiated, of bad business practices, lack of accountability and failing to pass on interest rates.  He went on to draw attention to things the Ombudsman had to say in that regard.  </P>
        <P>If those issues could be raised by an Opposition Deputy on 5 July 2006 when the Bill to enrich Michael Fingleton was introduced by the Government and put through the House in one night, how can the Taoiseach tell us that as Minister for Finance at that time he apparently had no knowledge of any of this, did not know anything of what was going on in Irish Nation<Col N="414"/>wide and had no report from any of the regulatory bodies?  The situation now is that we were told yesterday that Irish Nationwide has lost &euro;2.5 billion, had been giving out loans at 120% of the value of properties and so on.  There may be more to come but to date the taxpayer has been asked for &euro;2.7 billion to pay for all that folly yet the Taoiseach knew nothing of it.</P>

	<P>I made the point to Deputy Gilmore because he asked specifically about this matter.  I said there was no information then that the difficulties that have arisen now were about to arise in Irish Nationwide.  That is a fact.  He made a point about the legislation and characterised it as an effort to enrich individuals.  It was about providing an opportunity for building societies as to whether they wished to stay mutualised or to demutualise.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;apart from Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s interruptions, I make the point that the legislation was brought forward to provide both for the retention of mutualisation and for demutualisation if a building society so required.  Whether building societies demutualised was a matter for the membership of those societies to decide.  It was not a question of forcing anything through the House but of facilitating those building societies that wished to demutualise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>To answer Deputy Gilmore, the fact is there is no question from our point of view but that the banking inquiry should ask all necessary questions in regard to these matters and get full accountability for them.  That is what we intend to ensure will happen.  However, I also wish to make the point that it was not the case that there was any idea that such losses were imminent <Col N="415"/>or that people were suggesting that this would take place during the time I was Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Title>Death of Polish President: Expressions of Sympathy. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to express again my sincere sympathies and condolences and those of the Government following the tragic air accident which claimed the lives of the President of the Republic of Poland, His Excellency Lech Kaczynski , his wife, Maria Kaczynska, and 94 others at Smolensk in Russia on 10 April.</P>
        <P>The untimely death of President Kaczynski came as a great shock to me.  He paid a state visit to Ireland in February 2007 and although I did not meet him on that occasion I got to know him at meetings of the European Council which he often attended, alongside the Polish Prime Minister.  He made a major contribution to Polish public life as president, as minister for justice and as a great Solidarity personality in the 1980s and 1990s.  He was forthright in his views, a trait that stood him well in the many important political positions he held over the years.  That his wife, Maria, perished in the same accident makes the tragedy all the more horrific for their family and especially for their daughter Marta.</P>
        <P>The devastating scale of the accident, with so many victims drawn from all walks of public life in Poland, is difficult to comprehend.  Leading figures from the Polish Government and Parliament, the military, the church, the public service and civic society were killed in the tragedy, which will have left an indelible mark on Poland and her people.  The tragedy is all <Col N="416"/>the more poignant for the circumstances in which it happened.  The ill-fated aircraft was completing a journey to Smolensk in Russia, where the Polish President and his travelling party were due to attend a ceremony to commemorate the terrible massacre of thousands of Polish soldiers and civilians in Katyn forest in 1940.  What was to have been an important symbolic moment of reconciliation between Poland and Russia of a horrible episode in history became instead its own tragic and horrible event.</P>
        <P>The tragedy has touched the hearts of the people of Ireland in a way that brings out just how deep the bonds between the Irish and Polish people have become.  Our friendship goes back a long way but it is in more recent years that it has become fully cemented, particularly since Poland joined the European Union in 2004 during the Irish Presidency.  In the short period since, many tens of thousands of Polish people have come to Ireland, where they now live, work and participate in society.  It is almost impossible to fathom the grief felt by so many but we have tried, for our own part, to show our sympathies for, and solidarity with, the Polish people at this sad time.</P>
        <P>When I learned of the tragedy I spoke with the Polish Ambassador to Ireland and sent a letter of condolence to my counterpart, Donald Tusk, the Polish Prime Minister.  President McAleese and I participated in commemorative masses for the Polish community in Ireland last week.  I also visited the Polish embassy to sign the book of condolences there.  On the day of President Kaczynski&rsquo;s funeral, flags flew at half mast over State buildings in Ireland as a mark of respect and out of solidarity with the Polish people living in Ireland.  President McAleese was due to represent Ireland at the funeral but, unfortunately, like so many others, was unable to attend as a result of the restrictions on air travel over the weekend.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, I once again offer my condolences to the Polish Government and the Polish people at this sad time.  Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been bereaved and more generally with the Polish people everywhere, including the many thousands who live among us in Ireland today.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to convey the deep condolences of the Fine Gael Party to the Polish people on the tragic plane crash last week which cost the lives of 96 people.  This accident was a significant loss, particularly for the families which have lost loved ones.  It was also a significant loss to Poland, taking the lives of President Kaczynski, his wife and many other leading members of the Polish state and armed forces.</P>
        <P>President Kaczynski was a leading figure in Polish politics throughout the period since the re-establishment of democracy in 1989.  Prior to that he was a long-standing activist in the Solidarity movement led by Lech Walesa and was interned in the early 1980s.  His death deprives Poland of one of the fathers of its modern democratic system.  I have sent a message to Prime Minister Tusk, who is a member of our own grouping in the European context.  I also remember the Polish President&rsquo;s family, particularly his daughter Marta, who has lost both her parents.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>This tragedy has been felt deeply in this country because of the close relationship between Ireland and Poland, which has grown even closer in the short six years since Poland became a member of the European Union family.  In that time, more than 200,000 Polish people have come to live and work in this country, and they have made a significant contribution to our economy and lives.  Their grief following the plane crash has been shared by the Irish people, as we well understand what it feels like to face adversity while living far from one&rsquo;s home country.  I join with the Taoiseach and reiterate our solidarity with the Polish Government and its people at this painful time.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party I extend my deepest sympathies to the Polish people on the death of President Lech Kaczynski, his wife Maria and 94 other people in the Smolensk air crash on 10 April.  For any country, the death of so many of its citizens would be a terrible disaster but the loss of such a body of distinguished leaders of political, civic and military society in Poland is a particularly devastating blow.</P>
        <P>It is probable that no other country has had to experience the loss of so many key national figures in one accident.  Apart from President Kaczynski and his wife, the victims also included the chief of the Polish general staff and other senior military officers, the president of the national bank of Poland, the deputy foreign ministers and 12 members of the Polish Parliament, including Jerzy Szmajdzinski, the deputy speaker of the Polish Parliament who would also have been the Democratic Left Alliance candidate in the presidential elections due this autumn.  Also in the plane crash were the head of the Polish Olympic Committee, the Polish ombudsman, many key government officials and relatives of the victims of the Katyn massacre.</P>
        <P>It is a particularly poignant aspect of this disaster that these people died on their way to what was intended to be effectively a ceremony of reconciliation between the Polish and Russian people in a shared commemoration of the Katyn massacre of 22,000 soldiers and other Polish citizens by the Soviets in 1940.  If any small crumb of comfort can be drawn from this terrible disaster, it is perhaps that the shared sense of shock and loss has brought the two peoples closer.</P>
        <P>The Polish people have had a difficult history, having had to endure occupation and oppression on many occasions.  In the past 20 years, Poland has blossomed; its democracy is firmly established, its economy has grown and it has become a respected member of the European Union.  The loss of so many key political, military and economic figures will be a significant setback but I have no doubt the Polish people will recover from this disaster with the courage and determination that has characterised their long history.</P>
        <P>Our two countries have some shared experience in terms of history but the links between Ireland and Poland have developed significantly since it joined the European Union.  We have seen significant Polish immigration to this country and many of us now have Polish friends, neighbours and workmates.  A disaster like this must be even more difficult to cope with when away from one&rsquo;s own home, neighbours and community.  I particularly extend my deepest sympathy to the members of the Polish community in Ireland.

I express these condolences on behalf of my parliamentary colleagues and the entire Green Party.</P>
        <P>Poland has lost its president and all nations grieve when they lose their president.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the Polish people as they come to terms with this tragedy of losing a leader and other prominent political, military and religious figures.  Their death, while travelling to commemorate another tragedy, no doubt compounds the sorrow of the Polish people.  They have lost a man who dedicated his life to the pursuit of freedom, democracy and human rights.  We take political and civil rights for granted in this country but for many years Poland did not enjoy these rights.  President Kaczynski embodied a struggle to achieve such cherished goals.</P>
        <P>He was a man who had the courage of his convictions over many years of political struggle in his own land and he believed in high standards in public office.  He loved his country; he <Col N="418"/>was a patriot but not a nationalist.  He was rather sceptical of big business, not least because of the concern for workers&rsquo; rights.</P>
        <P>As a new Minister of State with responsibility for integration, I am acutely aware of the invaluable contribution the Polish community makes to our country and society.  In every county we have got to know the Polish people in our schools, sporting associations and workplaces.  We have also got to know their work ethic, industry and commitment to families.  Ireland has benefited from knowing our Polish friends and neighbours.  Their sorrow is our sorrow at this time.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ar mo shon f&eacute;in agus ar son Sinn F&eacute;in, ba mhaith liom comhbhr&oacute;n a chur chuig muintir na Polainne in &Eacute;irinn, sa Pholainn agus ar fud an domhain ar bh&aacute;s uachtar&aacute;n na Polainne agus 95 duine eile ar 10 Aibre&aacute;n seo caite.  On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in and on my own behalf I join in the expressions of sympathy to the Polish community in Ireland, and to the people of Poland, on the death of President Lech Kaczynski, together with 95 other leading Polish citizens in the tragic air crash of 10 April.  The circumstances of the accident emphasise the tragic history of Poland, as the delegation was on its way to commemorate the massacre of thousands of Polish prisoners of war and other citizens on the orders of Stalin in Katyn in 1940.  Some of the dead from 10 April were relatives of the Katyn victims.  Given our own history, the Irish people have had a special affinity with the people of Poland and have followed with interest and sympathy their long struggle for national self-determination and unity.</P>
        <P>In addition to recalling the late president as Head of State of Poland, Members also should recall the other victims of the accident.  I wish to mention in particular Anna Walentynowicz, who was also killed in the crash.  Her dismissal from her job in Gdansk in 1980 for trade union activity sparked the mass strikes out of which the Solidarity movement was born.  In her later years, she criticised the so-called &ldquo;self-styled capitalists selling off our plants and pocketing the money&rdquo;.  Her key role as a staunch trade unionist and Polish patriot also should be remembered.  Suaimhneas s&iacute;ora&iacute; d&aacute; n-anamacha uile.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for granting me the special opportunity of adding my voice to the other voices of sympathy for the victims of the Polish Air Force crash on 10 April.  I do so first as an Irish citizen and second as a public representative who always has taken a great interest in Poland and holds that country in great affection.  When Lord Mayor of Dublin, my first official visit was to Poland and, having advocated stronger links between our two countries for several years, I was honoured in 2002 by the Polish Government.</P>
        <P>While the loss of any single life is tragic, what makes the air crash on 10 April especially tragic is that the victims represented a group of leaders of Polish society of the highest calibre, political, moral and cultural, as well as past and present.  While the sympathy of this country of course goes out to the President of Poland, Lech Kaczynski and his wife Maria, an examination of all 96 persons on board indicates what a terrible loss this was to Poland, including 18 parliamentarians.  I wish to put on the record of the D&aacute;il the names of all 96 people who died in this crash and will do so later.</P>
        <P>I also wish to mention two people in particular.  The first is Ryszard Kaczorowski, who was born in 1919.  He was a Polish statesman who, between 1989 and 1990, served as the last president of Poland in exile.  Arrested in 1940 by the NKVD and sentenced to death, he was later set free and served in the army led by General Anders.  He fought in most of the major battles in which the Polish 2nd Corps participated, including the Battle of Monte Cassino.  He was a member of the National Council of Poland, the parliament in exile, he was the last president-in-exile of the Polish state and handed over the insignia of the presidential power of the second republic to President Lech Walesa on 22 September 1990.  I also wish to mention <Col N="419"/>the person to whom Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred, namely, Ms Anna Walentynowicz, who was one of the chief people in respect of the strike in the Gdansk shipyard.</P>
        <P>It is especially poignant that this tragedy occurred while the delegation was on its way to commemorate a massacre of 22,000 Polish officers and other Polish persons at Katyn in April 1940.  It is to be hoped that one of the consequences of this terrible tragedy is that Poland and Russia will move even closer to improving their relations, which would be a fitting tribute to all those who died on the Polish Air Force TU-154 on 10 April 2010.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha d&iacute;lse.</P>

	<P>I object to the Order of Business.  I do so because No. 3, which proposes to take the Central Bank Reform Bill, should be opposed on the basis that the Government does not wish to extend the inquiry beyond September 2008.  I outlined during Taoiseach&rsquo;s Questions what should be done if the Government is serious about sorting out this matter for once and for all to restore our financial and banking sectors.  I refer to having absolutely above board the institutions that deal with finance and financial lending with new regulatory regimes, as well as new oversight and regulation that works.  It is imperative that the inquiry is not a whitewash or a cover up and that it is open ended to deal with the ongoing exposure of the further litany of banking scandals referred to by the Minister for Finance in his speech in the House on 30 March.  He stated that senior banking officials had engaged in reckless lending for which the taxpayer would need to pay for years to come and that the banks had played fast and loose with Irish economic interests.  From this perspective, I am opposed to the Order of Business, as it features something we must do.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I also want to oppose the Order of Business.  These two motions are being taken together.  As a general principle, that should not be done.  I agree with Deputy Kenny that the core issue today is that the Government is relying on a make-believe investigation into what occurred in banking.  Last session, it rejected proposals by the Labour Party that there should be a proper inquiry into what occurred, particularly the Government&rsquo;s role and that of the Taoiseach during his period as Minister for Finance.  His replies today in response to Deputy Kenny and me are inadequate.  For those reasons, the Labour Party is opposing the proposals before the House on the Order of Business.</P>

	<P>Banking regulation legislation is vital and its absence has contributed in no small measure to the tragic situations we have witnessed.  The ongoing effect will be that ordinary citizens and families will face serious consequences in the time ahead.  It is imperative that there be real banking regulation in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>The Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, however, do not agree to the taking of this Bill in the absence of a draft code setting out the standards of fitness and probity that must apply.  The Bill referred to by previous speakers as part of the Order Paper indicates that the code is a key requirement, yet there is no indication as to how the code will be drafted, whether Opposition voices will have any input and when such a draft will present.  There is no provision for any of this.  The code setting out the standards of fitness and probity is central.  It is one of the cornerstones of any such legislation if the latter is to be effective.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Government Chief Whip on winning his first vote, admittedly by a short head.  Some Members opposite may have been a little concerned regarding the closeness of the result.</P>

	<P>It is Punchestown festival week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>On the legislative programme for 2010, it seems that despite the various facilities available to it the Government has not yet been able to adjust the names of the Departments to match what the Taoiseach indicated when he announced his Cabinet reshuffle.  In that context, reference is still being made to the Department of Education and Science, which should be the Department of Education and Skills, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which should be Enterprise, Trade and Innovation. The Department of Social and Family Affairs will become the Department of Social Protection.  Is there is a reason for that?</P>
        <P>Will the local government (Dublin mayor and regional authority) Bill be published, debated and finalised before the end of the summer session?  Has the Government made a decision on whether the elections for a directly elected Lord Mayor of Dublin will take place this year?  If so, has a date been finalised?</P>
        <P>I refer to the children&rsquo;s referendum, to which the Government and the all-party committee have committed.  Has the Government signed off on a date on when the children&rsquo;s referendum will be held?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about publishing the local government (Dublin mayor and regional authority) Bill during this session.  We planned for that to take place during 2010.  On the children&rsquo;s referendum, that report is to hand and is being considered by Government but no decision has been made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is intended to hold the mayoral election in 2010 and if there is a possibility of holding the children&rsquo;s referendum on the same day, is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No decision has been made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention to go further and hold a triple crown and include the by-elections?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No decision has been made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Noting what the Taoiseach said that it is intended to hold the election for the Lord Mayor of Dublin some time in 2010 and given that the people of Dublin South would be going to the polls some time in 2010 anyway, does he agree the logical date to have the Dublin South by-election would be on the same day as the election for the Lord Mayor of Dublin?  If he is going to have one by-election on that date, he might as well hold all three.  What would be the logic of having the election for the Lord Mayor of Dublin one day and the by-elections on another day?</P>
        <P>Since we are on the subject of the election of the Lord Mayor of Dublin, I note that is an addition to the list of Bills we are to get from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  There are now three Bills on that list for this session.  I notice two Bills on the list for the last session have disappeared.  One is the environment (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which the Minister promised would extend the scope of the landfill levy to include incineration.  The Minister was relying on this Bill to do something about the incinerator in Ringsend. <Col N="426"/> I am not quite clear what he was planning to do about the incinerator in Ringsend but he said he would do something about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Incinerate it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and it was based on this Bill.  </P>
        <P>The problem is that this Bill has disappeared from the legislative programme.  Does that mean the Minister is not going to do whatever he intended to do about the incinerator in Ringsend because the Bill is gone?  Will the Taoiseach tell us what has happened to the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is on the B list.  The Minister has examined a number of approaches to the application of waste facility levies and now considers it appropriate to consult key stakeholders having regard to changed circumstances in the waste management market and in the broader economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The old stakeholders again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Publication of the Bill will probably be next session and redrafting will likely be required on foot of the consultation.  Work is ongoing on that.  I have made no decisions in regard to the other matters. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to promised legislation from the Department of Health and Children, I note once again the current status of the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill is &ldquo;not possible to indicate&rdquo;, as has been the case for so long.  I note very worryingly that the spring programme stated publication of the promised mental health (amendment) Bill was expected to be 2010, but we have now been told publication is expected in 2011.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, who is responsible for mental health, is in the House.</P>
        <P>The spring programme indicated that publication of the public health (alcohol labelling provisions) Bill and the reference pricing for drugs Bill was expected in 2010 but the current programme states that it is not possible to indicate a publication date.  Time after time, as spokesperson for health and children, I, along with other Opposition voices covering this particular portfolio, have highlighted to the Taoiseach the failure of the Department of Health and Children and the Minister to ensure long promised and much needed legislation would be fast tracked.  Fast tracking does not come into consideration in regard to this Minister and this Department&rsquo;s work rate in terms of legislation, and I have not mentioned the nurses and midwives Bill.</P>
        <P>A very serious situation applies in this Department which merits the Taoiseach&rsquo;s scrutiny as well as that of other Opposition voices.  Prior to the Easter recess, I wrote to the Minister for Health and Children asking specific questions in regard to her then recent meeting with Justice for Magdalenes representatives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have to find some other way to pursue this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a reply stating that because of industrial action&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;-she is unable to answer my parliamentary question.  The Minister attended that meeting and I am not aware that she is in the middle of a work to rule or industrial action.  It is well within her gift to respond to the question and she should not <Col N="427"/>hide behind the cloak of the civil servants&rsquo; protest currently in train in her Department and in other Departments.  This is an absolute nonsense where Members of this House are not getting responses to legitimate parliamentary questions.  Rather than pleading with me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are other ways to raise the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle might very well do a better job pleading with Cabinet members to respond to Opposition voices&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>My duty is to ensure we have order on the Order of Business. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as is their duty and responsibility.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to one of the matters raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, the nurses and midwives Bill.  He is absolutely right about the spillage in time in regard to practically every Bill on the list from the Minister for Health and Children.  The nurses and midwives Bill was on the A list in the last session, which meant it should have been popped into my letter box before I returned to the House, but it did not.  It is on the A list again.  Will the nurses and midwives Bill be published this session and not in the summer holidays?</P>
        <P>Another Bill on that list, which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in did not mention, relates to sunbeds.  During the slack period last summer, the Minister made great play about how she would ban or control sunbeds but we have not heard a murmur from her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there promised legislation in that area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is on the never-never land list of Bills which will be published sometime or somewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We will make inquiries for the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, the Irish Cancer Society expressed concern about sunbeds.  Is the Minister ever going to do a little bit of work here?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the nurses and midwives Bill is due to be published next week.  The Whip has been rigorous in ensuring we get the Bills on A list.  A complaint of Deputies is when Bills are put on the A list but they are not published.  It is better to have as good and as accurate a list as possible which is realistic and based on current drafting issues.  The Office of the Attorney General and other legal draftspeople have been very busy.</P>

        <P Just="Left">On the other matters raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, if it is not possible to give a publication date at this stage, it is best to say so but that it is not to suggest that work is not ongoing on the matter.

	<P>Given the recent announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government of a list of heritage sites proposed for world heritage status, the failure to publish a national monuments Bill is a major stumbling block to the preservation of our heritage.  The Bill has again been put at the hind tit of the legislative programme.  When can we expect this long overdue legislation?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is whether any agency of the State takes responsibility for this issue.  I raised the matter with the county manager in south Dublin some time ago.  Horses are regularly being subjected to cruelty and there are, as Deputy Upton stated, two horse corpses in a field adjacent to Fonthill railway station.  Somebody should intervene because everybody is dodging the issue.  I do not want to make a political point. </P>
        <P>The Taoiseach indicated to me about three weeks ago that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is bringing proposals to Cabinet for a referendum to excise the reference to blasphemy in the Constitution.  I asked the Minister about this during the subsequent Question Time and while I will not say he sought to resile from that position, he certainly left the impression that rather than being a commitment to having a referendum to excise the reference to blasphemy, his statement fell more into the category of the late Seamus Brennan&rsquo;s dictum <Col N="429"/>that whatever one does, one should put out something on a Sunday.  Does the Government propose to hold such a referendum and, if so, when will it take place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has not made a decision to hold such a referendum.  The issue is one of a series of issues that would require a referendum were they to be proceeded with.  The issue of holding a referendum on children is also being considered. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Ministers should not toss out commitments to hold referenda if they are merely thinking aloud.  Many people who are interested in this issue understood from the Minister&rsquo;s statement that there would be a referendum, given his view that this was a constitutional imperative and he had to enshrine it in the new Defamation Act.  I do not know what to take from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response as to whether there will or will not be a referendum on blasphemy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on what the Minister has said, a referendum rather than legislation would be required to deal with the matter.  A decision on the timing and detail of how or when that would be done has not been taken by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>On promised legislation, I remind the Taoiseach that in recent weeks, notably since the House rose for the Easter recess, a number of disturbing attacks have been made on so-called head shops throughout the State.  I have a record of eight such attacks involving petrol bombs, arson and explosive devices.  The Minister for Health and Children has given some commitments on dealing with the issue, the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, has expressed responsibility and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently entered the fray by promising legislation.  What is the Government response to the matter of head shops, with particular reference to attacks on such premises involving criminal gangsters and dissident republicans?  The Government appears to be standing by and allowing these incidents to take place all too frequently. </P>
        <P>According to the legislative programme, the Minister for Health and Children is unable to indicate the possible date on which the legislation to license these facilities is expected.  What is the story?  What Departments are involved in this matter and what action, by way of legislation, will the Government take on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny today at which the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated that legislation was being prepared on head shops.  When I returned to my office, however, I noted that the legislative programme does not refer to any legislation related to head shops. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Secretary General asked us to watch this space, as it were, but gave no indication about the timing of legislation or whether measures on head shops would be included in other legislation proposed in the legislative programme.  Will stand-alone legislation be introduced to address all aspects of head shops or will measures be attached to the chemicals (amendment) Bill, Mental Capacity Bill or public health Bills?</P>
        <P>The Children&rsquo;s Act 1991 banned the sale of glues and other products to children aged under 18 years.  A one line amendment to that legislation would ensure that products currently being sold in head shops were banned for sale to those aged under 18 years.  This, at least, should be done urgently.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach will recall that a few years ago Members gathered one morning to pass legislation to protect State property and did so in about one hour.  I was the Labour Party spokesperson on the relevant issue at the time.  Will the Taoiseach not do likewise with regard to head shops given the fear and danger they present in our communities and in light of the issues raised by the two previous speakers?  Surely it would be possible to so, especially given the high standards we apply to all food products&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of banning certain products or substances, under the Misuse of Drugs Act it is proposed to introduce controls on a broad range of substances, which would make the possession and sale of these substances illegal and subject to criminal sanctions.  The draft regulations have been notified to the European Commission under the relevant technical standards directives.  This is a requirement as controls under the Misuse of Drugs Act involve a restriction on trade. </P>
        <P>In preparing the required regulations the Department of Health and Children consulted the relevant authorities to ensure that any legitimate uses of the substances involved are not impinged upon.  Four years ago, the Minister for Health and Children banned magic mushrooms and their possession and sale are now illegal.  Similar action was taken on 31 March last year to control and criminalise the possession and sale of BZP.</P>
        <P>Banning substances is an important and necessary step and one of a range of interventions needed to tackle the issue.  We are also working on a cross-departmental group with the Attorney General to ascertain how best to draw up legislation that would be watertight and not subject to constitutional challenge.

	<P>I want to ask the Taoiseach about the climate change Bill.   A proposed Bill was presented by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Heritage and Local Government last year, and it included an explanatory memorandum for legislation.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, produced a framework document soon after that which set out his intentions on a climate change Bill.  The indications then were that the Bill would be debated by June 2010.  I am surprised to find that in the legislative programme, we do not have any indication on when that Bill might be ready.  I presume that it will not now be ready in 2010 or even in 2011.  Would it be helpful if the committee produced the Bill for the Government?  We are well able to do so as we have done it already in respect of the Foreshore Act.  Green Party voters will be very disappointed at the fact that there is no indication for a climate change Bill.  Would the Taoiseach welcome such a Bill if it was produced by the Joint Committee on Environment, Heritage and Local Government?  Would he take it seriously and implement the targets that we must meet due to our international commitments?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you and the Deputies opposite for providing me with the opportunity to address this matter in the House.</P>
        <P>The volcanic eruptions in Iceland since last Thursday, 15 April have caused unprecedented disruption to European airline operations.  In order to ensure safety for aircraft and passengers, the immediate reaction of the national air navigation authorities across northern Europe, including the Irish Aviation Authority, was to impose flight restrictions in areas affected by the ash cloud. This had the effect of stranding hundreds of thousands of passengers ever since.  As the scale and implications of the eruptions became apparent over the course of the morning and early afternoon of 15 April, my Department activated the Government taskforce on emergency planning later that afternoon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The task force has met on a daily basis at the national emergency co-ordinating centre and is chaired by the Department of Transport.  It comprises representatives from all the relevant Departments and agencies.  In response to the crisis, the EU Ministers discussed the current restrictions during a teleconference yesterday afternoon and agreed a co-ordinated response that would permit the progressive opening of European air space based on technical data already gathered and on emerging data.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was agreed that three different zones will be effective as follows.  A no-fly zone will be maintained in the central nucleus of the ash emissions as safety cannot be guaranteed.  An outer buffer zone will be created where operations will not, in principle, be impeded, even though there may be small amounts of ash in this zone.  Decisions about operations in this zone will be taken in a co-ordinated manner by the authorities of the member states, based on all of the information available to the authorities.  There will then be a third zone, unaffected by the ash, where no restrictions of any kind would be imposed on operations. This began to be implemented throughout European air space from 5 o&rsquo;clock this morning.  However, as a result of increased eruptions yesterday afternoon and prevailing weather conditions, the anticipated <Col N="434"/>prospects for easing flight restrictions in Irish airspace has not materialised.  The latest information from the Irish Aviation Authority, issued at 4 p.m. this afternoon, is that Dublin and Cork airports will both remain closed until 8 p.m. this evening.  Shannon Airport is currently open but will close at 7 p.m. this evening.  A further update from the Irish Aviation Authority will issue at 8 p.m. this evening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The latest geological advice and information is that volcanic activity has entered a phase of less ash being generated.  Met &Eacute;ireann reports that while the forecast remains unchanged for the next few days, further evidence indicates that the weekend will bring changes to our weather pattern, which should enable flight restrictions to be eased over Ireland and Europe.  I have asked my Department to contact the airlines to establish how they intend to resume services, including with the backlog, as air space reopens.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to estimate the number of Irish people stranded abroad but based on overall figures estimated by the European Commission, it could be 30,000 or more.  However, the information available is that a significant proportion of this number may have successfully returned to Ireland by ferry.  The task force was informed today that while demand is very heavy, ferries still have some spare capacity.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Department of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; crisis response centre dealt with over 1,100 inquiries, mainly seeking information about alternative travel arrangements.  An official from the Irish embassy in Paris is positioned in Cherbourg to be of assistance to travellers.</P>
        <P>In order to support visitors stranded in Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is in daily contact with 4,000 accommodation providers across the country and the 70 tourist offices.  I understand that special accommodation rates in Bord F&aacute;ilte-approved premises are available for travellers who can demonstrate that they have been stranded.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation reported that while a number of companies have experienced particular difficulties, a substantial number of Irish exporters have found alternative channels for their products.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  Why could we not get much more precise figures on the number of Irish travellers stranded abroad than either the Minister or one of his officials gave us this afternoon?  We were given a figure of 20,000 to 30,000 but was it not possible to obtain more precise information from companies such as Aer Lingus, Ryanair and Aer Arann?  Has the Minister been in contact with other EU governments, including the UK, regarding that matter? </P>
        <P>I am glad to hear the Minister&rsquo;s announcement concerning F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  My colleague, Deputy Mary Upton, sought such a facility for passengers stranded here but what about the performance of the airlines themselves?  As the Minister knows, serious complaints have been made on Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; show and other programmes about the difficulty of contacting Aer Lingus and Ryanair.  People in Spain and other European countries have said that the two main Irish airlines did not want to know.</P>
        <P>The EU Transport Commissioner, Siim Kallas, says that EU passenger rights continue to apply in these circumstances, including the right to receive information from airlines, as well as the right to care, refreshment, meals and accommodation, as appropriate, and the right to choose between reimbursement or being re-routed.  Those are the rights that passengers have, yet it seems that the two main Irish airlines have not behaved well in this regard.  Is that the Minister&rsquo;s experience and, if so, does he have any message for Aer Lingus and Ryanair?</P>
        <P>I also welcome the announcement by Ulster Bank that it is providing credit facilities for our people who are stranded abroad.  Has the Minister had any contact with the Minister for Fin<Col N="435"/>ance, the Central Bank and the other main banks to ask if they will emulate Ulster Bank&rsquo;s example?</P>
        <P>Why did it take five days for the Minister and the other EU transport ministers to have a video conference on this matter?  Why did they not act on Friday or Saturday?  While it is a natural disaster, it would have been useful if transport ministers had an earlier video conference with the EU Transport Commissioner.  Will the Minister have ongoing meetings with his EU counterparts now?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Despite what the Minister said about the three zones, can he provide more details on the no-fly, buffer and third zones?  How many miles wide are they?</P>
        <P>There has been some criticism of the scientific advice by a Dutch MEP, Peter van Dalen.  He said that the original ban was far too rigid.  We have had experience in the Far East, including the Pacific, and North America, including Alaska, of aircraft having to cope with volcanic ash.  Mr. van Dalen and some other MEPs believe that the original response was too rigid.  We should have had more detailed meetings and a quicker recourse to international scientific advice to see if a partial reopening of airspace was possible.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, President Grimsson of Iceland said that if the big volcano beside Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull, called Katla, blows we will have to consider other forms of transport than aviation.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s estimate of the economic damage to Irish airports, airlines and other companies operating out of airports?  When all this is over, will there be any ongoing thinking in the Department about how important maritime and rail links are to this country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has raised a number of questions.  Regulation EC 261 of 2004 applies to the rights of passengers.  The enforcement body for this particular regulation in Ireland is the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  The rights contained in that regulation apply to all passengers departing from EU airports as well as to those passengers departing from outside the EU, but arriving at an EU airport.  The regulation does not apply to passengers travelling free of charge or at a reduced rate, but applies to scheduled and non-scheduled flights.  It sets out minimum rights for air passengers when certain events occur, namely, being denied boarding, flight cancellations or flight delays.  In summary, when a flight is cancelled with no prior notice, passengers are entitled to be informed of their legal rights by the airline; have access to telephone, fax, telex or other forms of communication; a refund or an alternative flight to their destination, subject to availability; and food, refreshments and accommodation offered by the airline, free of charge, while waiting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The allegation is that people have been left to their own devices.  Is that good enough?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow the Minister to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy requested information and I am imparting it to him.  If that is not happening &mdash; and I agree that in some cases it is not &mdash; the body that will enforce that and to which people should report, is the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  Currently, however, as people are in very difficult circumstances, it will not be much good to them to report to the Commission for Aviation Regulation and get compensation afterwards.  Through my Department therefore I have been in contact with airlines where complaints have been made.  I have to say that I have only received complaints about one airline &mdash; and it is not the one we would normally expect &mdash; concerning a lack of information and people not being able to get through to get information from it.  I do not think the amount of information being made available from, or contact with, the airline is sufficient. Airline management will say that <Col N="436"/>because of the major difficulties as a result of the number of people caught in different places, many of their systems, such as telephone systems, are having difficulty coping.  </P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The bodies responsible for ensuring clear air space over Ireland and Europe are the various aviation authorities.  They were in action from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; in this regard.  Eurocontrol is the organisation responsible for the safety of air traffic in central Europe and it was in close contact with the various air traffic control bodies in all areas.  Together, they make the decisions on operational matters.  I heard the captain of the flight that went through volcanic ash some years ago say on radio today that politicians should stay out of such decisions because they are made on the basis of scientific advice.  The scientific advice available was to the effect that there should be no flights.  It is only when it was anticipated that the ash would start to disperse that the need for a political decision arose.  The European Union Presidency arranged the teleconference yesterday for that reason and a decision was made as a result.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>The Deputy asked how wide the various zones were.  The extent of the zones depends on the ash, its dispersal and the cloud.  The primary or no-fly zone is the area immediately around the volcano.  The second zone is the area covered by the ash cloud.  Maps are produced on a daily basis and these track the ash cloud.  The area involved becomes the buffer zone and when it is deemed safe to fly in that zone, flights will be allowed.  The size or width of the zones varies, depending on the ash in the air.</P>
        <P>Some people feel we over reacted.  It is easy for people to say that now.  However, if a plane crashed in Irish air space, I am sure I would be here trying to explain why I had not told the aviation authority to close down Irish air space.  It would be a similar case if a crash occurred in Europe.  It is very easy for people with no responsibility in this matter to say we over reacted.  I refute and reject that.  We operated and reacted in accordance with the general scientific advice available.  However, the specifics of the cloud of ash over Ireland had to be measured and we had to obtain the scientific data.  The precautionary principle was applied and I believe it was the correct approach.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s final point, it will be some time before the cost to airlines and airports can be fully measured, because it is an ongoing situation.  I have seen estimates for Aer Lingus of a possible loss of &euro;5 million a day, but some of that loss will be made up when flights are resumed.  A loss in the region of from &euro;7 million to &euro;10 million per day has been projected for Ryanair and a loss of from &euro;15 million to &euro;20 million a day for British Airways.  The airports are also losing revenue, as are the retail outlets in the airports.  Tourism will also lose out in some way, but this loss may be compensated for by the fact that some people are staying home for holidays and some tourists have been delayed here.  There are swings and roundabouts with regard to the problem.  The damage from an economic and export point of view, if any, will not be known for some time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for placing this matter on the agenda today.  I agree with the Minister that we cannot interfere with the scientific evidence and that safety must be paramount.  However, I have questions about the Minister&rsquo;s accountability and that of the Department of Foreign Affairs in dealing with the issues.</P>
        <P>What protocols are or were in place last Thursday to deal with people who were stranded abroad?  I refer specifically to Madrid where over 200 passengers were stranded and unable to make or receive contact from the Irish Embassy there over the weekend.  I received a number of calls from people concerned about this.  Does the Minister not agree that all our consulates <Col N="437"/>and embassies, or at least those in key hubs, should have immediately put a 24-hour service in place, or at least a service from 7 a.m. to midnight, to deal with the queries of people who were worried and concerned?  I am unhappy that was not the case.  Having been contacted by people in distress, I raised the matter with the Department of Foreign Affairs on Sunday morning.  It immediately rang the people concerned and gave them help and advice.  However, they did not get that assistance in Madrid and their calls were not answered.  I would like the Minister to analyse the reason for that and bring the facts to our attention.  What protocols are in place for such contingencies?</P>
        <P>A significant question also arises with regard to people stranded abroad with medical problems.  A number of people who were also in Madrid contacted me in this regard.  They had difficulty, even when they had a scanned copy of their prescriptions from their doctors in Ireland, because these were not accepted by the pharmacists in Madrid.  It is important that embassies and consulates are able to disseminate the names and addresses of doctors or pharmacists who could assist such patients.  It would, for example, be helpful if lists of doctors in the relevant countries were posted on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Some people had unforeseen medical expenses or missed appointments here or have incurred expenses over and above what they expected.  Will the Minister consider this from a humanitarian point of view and try to address the issue with regard to those who faced significant expenditure or had to pay for private consultations?</P>
        <P>There has also been an issue with regard to profiteering.  I understand a group of eight people stranded in Tenerife are being charged the princely sum of &euro;1,200 for a flight from Tenerife to Barcelona.  Profiteering is an issue that has arisen and I would like to know what the European Union will do to deal with it.  Profiteers are trying to get blood out of a stone and people are being put into extreme expenditure due to unfair profiteering by agencies abroad.  Can or should the European Union do more to arrange that national governments put protocols in place in this regard?  The Minister has said that he has arranged that people stranded here will not be ripped off and has made special provisions with bed and breakfast accommodation for travellers.  I welcome that.  Can we insist that a policy be developed to be put in place throughout the European Union for the future?</P>
        <P>The dormant volcano close to the erupting volcano is expected to blow within the next decade or at least during this century.  It will have been dormant for 100 years in 2016.  What arrangements are being put in place to deal with that?  Its eruption may be more severe and have more adverse effects than those we are suffering currently.  We need a structure in place to ensure that people are ready to act immediately, that the Department of Foreign Affairs and our embassies abroad are available on a 24-hour basis and that arrangements are put in place to deal with medical and profiteering issues.</P>
        <P>Larger countries, such as the United Kingdom, have the capacity to send their naval services to carry citizens home.  We should be able to liaise with those countries and make an arrangement or put a strategy in place to obtain their assistance.  An arrangement should also be made for Governments, such as the Spanish Government, to deal with the issues of people stranded in places like Tenerife and the Canaries.  People stranded in those areas are being charged a fortune to leave those areas and get back to the Spanish mainland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of issues were raised.  Some of them were not directly related but I will try to respond as best I can.  An event such as this is unprecedented in Europe and I do not think any of us ever imagined when this began last Thursday that we would still be talking about it on Tuesday or would probably be speaking about its effects on this day <Col N="438"/>week also.  As soon as the air space is freed up I expect we will have an urgent meeting of Ministers with responsibility for transport to discuss all aspects of it.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s final point, with regard to it recurring in the short term with the same volcano or with the large one beside it, Katla, we need to learn from what has happened.  In this regard the Deputy mentioned incidents which need to be examined.  The behaviour, reaction and response of the airlines and airports should be examined as should the response of host countries to try to learn from them.  It is fair to state that although sometimes European regulations can be fairly obscure we probably have the strongest set of guarantees for passengers of any area in the world.  However, I am sure we can learn from this experience and perhaps improve them.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether anything can be done about profiteering in other countries of which I heard about from various constituents.  However, I acknowledge, as the Deputy did, that in Ireland while we can be accused of raising prices when demand increases for specific events what has happened here generally with regard to accommodation and meals is that registered bed and breakfast and F&aacute;ilte Ireland outlets have endeavoured to keep prices down to make those already distressed feel a little more at home.  They are to be commended for that.  I must correct the Deputy as it was not something we told them to do, they undertook to do it themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland was on the group and issues were raised with it to ensure there would be accommodation and this was the response we received.  The Irish tourism industry and accommodation providers can take a bow for this.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed to hear what the Deputy had to say about the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I cannot contradict it.  I know he stated it more in sorrow than in anger because in my experience the Department has always been very responsive.  Perhaps it was overrun with this particular problem.  I have not received that many complaints about its lack of response but I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point on it.  The matter has been resolved now.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has an emergency number in place and people are using it.  More than 1,000 people used it yesterday.  I am sure all of us, including the Deputy, were told the best advice we could give was to contact consuls and embassies abroad.  Anybody who managed to do so was looked after very well.  His point was that perhaps in the first two or three days they were not able to get&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the weekend there was voice-mail but no voice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We will take that up.  The point was made that people were not able to obtain their medicines or were running out of them.  That has been largely resolved although there were some difficulties with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will raise different issues so we will not have repetition.  Many airlines are speaking about compensation.  Last night, the chief executive of British Airways, Willie Walsh, stated there was a precedent for this as it happened after the attacks of 11 September 2001 when the United States skies were closed.  Will the Minister make representations at EU level for compensation, in particular for Irish airlines? Ireland is an island nation and is very much dependent  on aviation, as has been seen in recent days.  Aer Lingus stated it is running losses of &euro;4 million a day although it has cash reserves of approximately &euro;375 million.  This has <Col N="439"/>put huge strain on airlines.  We do not know yet how much Ryanair is losing.  Will a case be made at European level for compensation?</P>
        <P>At their video-conference meeting on Monday did the Ministers put in place a contingency plan in the event of something similar happening whereby Ministers with responsibility for transport or Governments would meet aviation authorities to discuss such emergencies?  This one has cost Europe much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If the EU decides to offer compensation to airlines, we will make a very strong case for Irish airlines.  However, at this point in time, with the budgetary situation we have, we do not anticipate we will be leading a charge to have States compensating airlines.  We do not have the money to do so and we cannot do so.  I saw the statement issued by the EU Commissioner, which was a bit careful.  If the EU decides to provide a compensation package we will fight for our share of it.  However, we do not anticipate being in a position to pay compensation directly to airlines because of our financial situation.  I would be wary of compensation for an event such as this because it would tend to favour larger legacy airlines in Europe rather than ourselves.  In the longer term it might prove to be more detrimental than helpful to Irish airlines.</P>
        <P>As soon as the situation is resolved there will be a formal meeting of Ministers at which we will have a discussion and, having learned from this particular experience, put in place whatever plans are necessary for anything that might happen in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask the Minister again about people abroad running out of money.  Will he and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, speak to the banks other than Ulster Bank to enable people to have enough credit?</P>
        <P>I commend Bus &Eacute;ireann for laying on extra coaches to London and other parts of the UK.  Is this something the Minister can encourage?  Will he liaise with Irish Ferries, Stena Line and the other operators to ensure we have a fallback position on the maritime and road fronts?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I can raise that with the Minister for Finance.  It is hoped that as a result of what has been stated here other banks will take the lead from Ulster Bank.</P>
        <P>I commend Bus &Eacute;ireann on the way it responded by putting on extra buses.  I am sure there is business for other companies if they want to look in that direction.  We have been in contact with ferry operators and they also participated in the task force.  The capacity is still there.  An extra 500 people were brought back on the Swansea to Cork ferry last night which indicates the ferries are responding very well.  It will be important to learn the lessons from this and the importance of having Irish ferries operating is underlined by an incident such as this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Some people may have incurred excessive or unusual medical expenses through no fault of their own as a result of being out of the country and having to pay for it abroad when they would have got it free at home.  Would the Government be prepared to consider cases with such significant expenses?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not undertake that the Government would underwrite those expenses.  However, I would take it that insurance policies would cover them.  I can certainly raise the other point the Deputy made on appointments with the Minister for Health and Children.  Someone who might have missed an important medical appointment should be facilitated.  I will take up that with the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>It is now three weeks since I outlined to this House the last major element of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to resolve our banking crisis.  The decisive and bold steps we have taken are not popular, and the honest and full disclosure by the Government and its agencies of the appalling mess we have uncovered within our banks has shocked the nation.  However, I believe there is recognition among the citizens that the measures we have taken are necessary and that they are the correct measures to put our financial institutions back on a sound footing so that they can return to the business of serving the best interests of our economy.</P>
        <P>I believe public confidence in the system of regulation we have put in place is growing by the day and I believe that the work of NAMA in cleaning up the banks&rsquo; balance sheets and forcing them and their borrowers to face up to their losses is winning the respect of the public.  I want to acknowledge, in particular, the contributions of the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, the Financial Regulator, Matthew Elderfield, and the chief executive of NAMA, Brendan McDonagh.  In the past three weeks, they have, in their respective roles brought enormous credibility and professionalism to the new structures the Government has put in place to resolve the banking crisis.</P>
        <P>The decisions we have taken have met with approval internationally.  The IMF has stated the measures we have put in place will preserve our financial stability and ensure our banks can withstand any future losses.  The Commission Vice-President for Competition, Joaqu&iacute;n Almunia, has also endorsed our actions.  Specifically he said, &ldquo;There is no doubt that both Anglo Irish Bank and INBS need a significant recapitalisation to meet their obligations.  The measures are also necessary to preserve financial stability in Ireland.&rdquo;  There has been favourable commentary from respected newspapers such as the <i>Financial Times</i> and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> as well as <i>The Economist</i> magazine and <i>Newsweek</i>.  The financial markets have reacted favourably.  The ratings agency Moody&rsquo;s described NAMA as an ingenious mechanism with several successful historical precedents.</P>
        <P>All of this international approval reinforces the confidence engendered by the manner in which the Government has addressed the imbalance in our public finances in the past two years.  The fact is that Ireland is now regarded by international investors as a country that faces up to its problems and deals with them effectively.  The credit for this growing confidence rests with the citizens themselves.  They have demonstrated their gritty determination to get this economy back on the road to growth.  They have shown the world that the enterprising spirit that brought us the boom is alive and well and will lead us back to recovery.</P>
        <P>The ESRI in its quarterly economic commentary published last week confirmed the forecast of the Central Bank of Ireland and of my own Department of a return to growth in the second half of this year.  There is mounting evidence that economic conditions are stabilising.  Consumer sentiment is improving, car sales have increased noticeably, while surveys of manufacturing and services firms confirm we are moving in the right direction.  The emerging recovery is, out of necessity, being led by the exporting sectors of our economy.  This reflects the somewhat improved international economic environment, as well as the competitiveness we have regained through the difficult budgetary measures we have taken.</P><Col N="441"/>
        <P>We know from past experience that employment growth can lag behind economic recovery.  However, as the recovery gains momentum, the sole focus of the Government will be to foster the conditions in which jobs can be created.  Let us remember that is what the banking measures are all about.  Unless we have healthy banks providing credit to viable businesses, we will not create jobs.  There is no gainsaying that reality.  No amount of political mischief making about our motivation in solving this banking crisis will distract us from the objective of getting our people back to work.  That is why we want to move forward with financial regulatory reform as quickly as we can.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Central Bank Reform Bill is a crucial step in a comprehensive programme to put in place a domestic regulatory framework for financial services that meets the Government objective of maintaining the stability of the financial system; that provides for the effective and efficient supervision of financial institutions and markets; and that safeguards the interests of consumers and investors.  This is the first of a three-stage legislative process to create a new fully integrated structure for financial regulation.  It provides a statutory basis for the new structure to replace the existing Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Deputies might well ask why a three-stage structure.  This is the first Bill.  The third Bill is a consolidation Bill and the other Bill contains further reforms.  However, it is important to note that the regulator was recruited as the head of financial regulation and the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland was appointed as governor with the intention that their positions be reflected in legislation as quickly as possible.  In other words they were appointed on the basis that this legislation would come into force.  It is of urgent importance that we enact the necessary legislation that provides for a revised corporate structure within which the governor and head of financial regulation can operate.</P>
        <P>A second Bill, to be brought before the House in the autumn will enhance the powers and functions of the restructured Central Bank of Ireland regarding the prudential supervision of individual financial institutions; the conduct of business, including the protection of consumer interest; and the overall stability of the financial system.  A third Bill will consolidate the existing statutory arrangements for the Central Bank of Ireland and financial regulation in the State.  This legislative programme, while demanding and complex, is essential.  A sound financial regulatory regime is fundamental to a sustainable and dynamic financial services industry.</P>
        <P>Prior to the financial crisis, there was a view that the structures and systems responsible for financial regulation were effective and appropriate.  As we now know, that confidence was seriously misplaced.  The previous regulatory system failed spectacularly to prevent what we now know to have been grossly excessive and irresponsible lending to the property sector.  As a result, our most systemically important banks have had to be recapitalised and Anglo Irish Bank has had to be brought fully into public ownership.  The financial system overall has been severely shaken and customers and households are managing unprecedented levels of debt.</P>
        <P>Wide-ranging reform is urgently required.  We need a system where the overarching objective of the stability of the system informs directly the supervision of individual firms while at the same time safeguarding the interests of consumers and investors.  The Central Bank Reform Bill delivers on that clear and simple objective and it is important it is enacted as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>My Department has initiated consultations with key stakeholders.  I will reflect on the issues emerging from that process in the coming days.  I understand Opposition spokespeople have been also briefed by my Department and I will, of course, reflect on the views expressed in this debate also.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains significant changes.  The reformed institution will be known as the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority will be dissolved and the <Col N="442"/>post of chief executive of IFSRA will be abolished.  A new integrated structure with a unitary board, the Central Bank Commission, is being established to be chaired by the governor.  It will be responsible at once for the stability of the financial system overall, prudential regulation of financial institutions, and the protection of consumer interests.</P>
        <P>The head of financial regulation and the head of central banking will be given a statutory basis.  The Bill includes transitional arrangements to enable the incumbents of the posts of chief executive of the Financial Regulator, Matthew Elderfield, and the director general of the Central Bank of Ireland, Mr. Tony Grimes, to take up these positions upon commencement of the relevant sections of the Bill.  The statutory positions of Registrar of Credit Unions and Financial Services Ombudsman will not be changed.</P>
        <P>The Governor remains solely responsible for European System of Central Banks-related functions.  The bank&rsquo;s independence in this regard is strengthened further by the Bill.  In order to put in place an unambiguous regulatory focus, the bank&rsquo;s statutory role of promoting the development within the State of the financial services industry will be removed.  Alternative and improved arrangements for the development of the financial services industry are being examined.</P>
        <P>Apart from providing for the new fully-integrated structures, the Bill enhances accountability and oversight mechanisms of the governance of the bank and its regulatory performance.  Under its provisions, a committee of the Oireachtas will now receive an annual regulatory performance statement.  This innovation is consistent with the recent recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his special report on the Financial Regulator.  The Bill requires the bank to arrange regular peer reviews of its regulatory performance at least every four years and to report on such reviews in the performance statement.  The bank will also be required to prepare a strategy statement every three years in addition to its annual report and accounts.</P>
        <P>The Bill transfers responsibility for consumer information and education to the National Consumer Agency along with associated staff.  In this way, the new institution will have a sharper focus for regulating how financial institutions deal with their customers &mdash; the so called &ldquo;conduct of business&rdquo; regulation.  While the post of consumer director and the statutory consultative consumer panel will be abolished, the consumer function will be integral to the bank itself.  Consumer issues will have to be planned and reported on in the regulatory performance statement and the bank&rsquo;s performance in this area will be subject to Oireachtas scrutiny and oversight.</P>
        <P>Both the consultative consumer panel and the consultative industry panel are being abolished and replaced by new arrangements through which the bank will have the power to establish expert groups to advise it on the exercise of its functions.  Specifically, it must establish a group to advise on consumer-related functions.  The bank will be required to report on all advisory groups in its annual report.</P>
        <P>The Bill gives the National Consumer Agency the power to impose levies on financial service providers for the purpose of funding the functions assigned to it.  In addition, the bank or a body prescribed by the Minister for Finance, including the Pensions Board, the Financial Services Ombudsman and the National Consumer Agency, may collect the various industry levies as an agent of the others.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for new powers for the bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers.  These are the powers to which Mr. Elderfield referred in his evidence to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last week.  It was my view that rather than waiting for the next Bill which will enhance regulatory functions, these powers should be brought <Col N="443"/>forward in this legislation because of their importance in helping to set the tone of the new regulatory arrangements.  We have seen, as late as yesterday, the devastating effects of irresponsible and incompetent behaviour at senior levels in financial institutions and we must ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the powers exist to prevent such behaviour in the future.  These new powers for the bank will help restore confidence in the management of financial institutions both domestically and in international markets.</P>
        <P>Two other measures contained in the Bill are not related to the reform of the bank&rsquo;s organisational structures.  First, greater flexibility is being given to credit unions to reschedule loan arrears subject to appropriate liquidity, provisioning and accounting transparency.  Second, the Insurance Act 1989 is being amended to enable the bank to appoint employees of the bank or other suitably qualified persons to be authorised officers for the purposes of the Insurance Acts.  This gives the bank flexibility to ensure compliance with insurance regulations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Overall, the structural changes contained in the Bill will deliver better co-operation and co-ordination between prudential supervision of individual institutions, conduct of business regulation and the maintenance of financial stability overall.  The Bill establishes a new financial regulatory regime.  I am confident it will attract and retain the confidence of consumers and investors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The causes of our financial crisis will be investigated by a commission of inquiry later this year.  As the House is aware, two separate scoping inquiries which will inform the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference are now under way.  The causes of the global financial crisis have also been the subject of detailed analysis.  The Group of Twenty countries and the EU have been working to put in place a wide-ranging programme of reform to address many of the weaknesses in financial regulation, supervision and corporate governance that contributed to the banking crisis.  This programme of reform will lead to improved supervision and international co-operation.  It will strengthen prudential requirements, improve risk management and market integrity and provide greater transparency of the world financial system.  The scope of regulation is being expanded to include parts of the financial system that hitherto had been considered of little systemic importance.  Governments and regulators now recognise that the systemic nature of individual components of the financial system goes far beyond traditional and more visible sectors such as banking.  The second Bill, to be published in the autumn, will deal specifically with necessary enhancements and adjustments to the new institution&rsquo;s powers and functions, and will take account of EU developments and emerging best practice at international level.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s Bill amends the Central Bank Act 1942, which itself has been subject to several major and numerous minor amendments over the years.  The result is a collection of related enactments that urgently require consolidation.  The European Central Bank has drawn attention to this requirement on a number of occasions, most recently in its opinion on the heads of the Bill before the House today.  I intend that the programme of regulatory reform, beginning with today&rsquo;s Bill, will deliver a consolidated text as soon as practicalities allow.</P>
        <P>The Bill is necessarily complex in its composition.  However, the central aim &mdash; to put in place a unified and integrated structure &mdash; is straightforward.  The bulk of the amendments to the 1942 Act are to be found in Schedule 1, which begins on page 35.  Section 14(1) provides for the wholesale implementation of the changes set out in the Schedule to the 1942 Act.  These changes give effect to the structural changes in the current arrangements.  These are as follows: the creation of the Central Bank Commission; the dissolution of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority; the establishment of a new management structure within the bank; and the introduction of new accountability measures; and, in particular, enhanced accountability to the Oireachtas.</P><Col N="444"/>
        <P>Section 2 provides for the commencement of the Act by way of ministerial order, with provision to allow for various elements of the Act to take effect on different dates.  Section 3 provides that the interpretation of expressions in the Act is to be the same as the interpretation of expressions in the principal Act unless otherwise stated.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides that the chief executive of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority immediately before the commencement of the section is to be the first head of financial regulation and will hold that office until he or she would otherwise have continued to hold the office of chief executive.  Sections 5 and 6 carry over the terms and conditions of employment of existing Central Bank employees and set out the arrangements whereby staff of the Central Bank may be seconded or transferred to the National Consumer Agency to carry out functions now being transferred to the agency.</P>
        <P>Sections 7 to 12 set out the continuity provisions that enable the Central Bank to carry on various activities that it is inheriting from the previous regulatory structure.  Sections 14 and 15 provide for the amendment of the Acts and other Acts referred to in the Schedules to the Bill.  Sections 16 and 17 provide for the replacement or deletion of certain obsolete references.</P>
        <P>Part 3, covering sections 18 to 44, provides for a &ldquo;fitness and probity&rdquo; regime to be applied by the Financial Regulator.  This will enable the bank to regulate appointments within financial service providers to help ensure the fitness and probity of significant office holders.  The main elements of the provisions include: a measure that will enable the banks to prescribe functions which are to be &ldquo;controlled functions&rdquo; and to suspend persons performing such functions pending an investigation into whether they should be prohibited from performing these functions on the basis that they are not fit and proper persons to perform them; the power to suspend a person for a maximum period of two months where the head of financial regulation, or his nominee, is of the opinion that there is sufficient reason to suspect that a person is not a fit and proper person; powers for the Central Bank to prohibit a person from carrying out controlled functions with the order being contingent on, among other things, the Governor of the bank, or his nominee, forming a reasonable opinion that the person is not a fit and proper person; powers for the bank to apply to the High Court for an order prohibiting a person from performing a controlled function should a direction not be complied with; powers to permit the bank to prescribe a subset of controlled functions which allow the person concerned to exercise a significant influence on the conduct of a regulated financial service provider; and power to allow the bank to issue standards of fitness and probity in respect of controlled functions and prohibiting regulated financial service providers from permitting people who do not satisfy these standards from performing controlled functions.</P>
        <P>Schedule 1 contains the key reforms to the structures of the bank.  Items 1 to 19 set out various changes to definitions and interpretation provisions.  I will focus on changes of substance rather than technical or consequential changes.  Items 20 to 27 relate to the establishment of the Central Bank of Ireland, its functions and objectives and other related matters.  The primary objective is to maintain price stability.  Other objectives and functions include the stability of the financial system overall; the proper and effective regulation of financial institutions and markets; the efficient and effective operation of payment and settlements systems; the provision of analysis and comment to support national economic policy development; monitoring of the provision of financial services having regard to the public interest and the interest of consumers; and the collection, study and publication of data that deal with monetary and credit problems.</P>
        <P>Importantly, item 23 inserts a new provision which puts beyond all doubt the independence of the bank, the governor and the Central Bank Commission in matters relating to the Treaty of Rome and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks.  I believe the Bill as <Col N="445"/>published should copper-fasten this independence in a way that respects both the letter and spirit of the relevant statutes and which provides the necessary assurances as to the robustness of our regulatory system.  The European Central Bank has attached the same importance to this issue in its recent opinion.</P>
        <P>Item 28 substitutes new sections into the Central Bank Act relating to the new boardroom arrangements for the Central Bank commission.  The commission is to consist of the Governor, who is the chairman of the commission, the two heads of function, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and between six and eight other members appointed by the Minister for Finance.  The amendments also provide new powers to enable the commission to establish advisory groups.  While they include a specific requirement in this regard in respect of its consumer-related functions, the bank will also take into account the importance of an industry voice in exercising its powers in this area.  Item 28 also provides that functions may be delegated within the Central Bank in certain circumstances.</P>
        <P>Items 30 to 34 deal with the Governor, providing that, to underpin the independence of the Central Bank, he has the sole right to determine budgetary or funding issues in relation to the bank.</P>
        <P>The 1942 Act is being amended to remove the requirement for a unanimous resolution of the board of the bank to request the removal of the Governor from office for specified grounds of serious misconduct.  This requirement was an anomaly in the original legislation that did not make sense.  In removing it, there is no diminution of the security of the governor in his post but merely a more logical procedure for an admittedly unlikely scenario.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance may appoint members of the commission if satisfied that the people nominated have experience in a relevant field of expertise, for example, financial regulation, banking or consumer interests.  Members are ordinarily appointed for a term of five years, except for the Governor, the heads of function and the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, who serve as members for as long as they hold their respective offices.  Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament, a local authority or persons who consent to be nominated to become members of one of those bodies are not eligible to hold the office of head of function or to become a member of the Central Bank commission.</P>
        <P>Item 39 sets out the management, finance and accountability provisions for the Central Bank.  I am pleased to be able to enhance the role of the Oireachtas in overseeing the performance of the bank.  This was a major consideration for the Government when deciding on the elements of the reform package.  The bank is required to submit a strategic plan once every three years to the Oireachtas through the Minister for Finance, specifying the bank&rsquo;s objectives and its plan to achieve them.  Additionally, an annual regulatory performance statement is to be prepared and presented to the Minister for Finance, which will include details of the bank&rsquo;s internal audit function and in respect of the activities of the Registrar of Credit Unions.  This performance statement will form the basis of an examination by the relevant committee and the committee may require the governor, the head of financial regulation or the head of central banking to appear before it to be examined on the contents of the statement.  This will ensure regular parliamentary consideration of the state of financial regulation.  The bank will also undergo a review of its performance by one of its peers, or another suitability qualified person, at least every four years.</P>
        <P>Part 5 of Schedule 2 provides for the amendment of the Consumer Protection Act 1995 to take account of the dissolution of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and the creation of a unitary structure.  This part provides for the transfer of certain functions formerly performed by the consumer director to the National Consumer Agency.</P><Col N="446"/>
        <P>Part 7 of Schedule 2 introduces an important amendment in respect of credit unions.  As Minister for Finance, I have supported the development potential of credit unions to ensure they continue to provide for the financial, saving and borrowing needs of the communities they serve.  Many credit union members are experiencing difficulty in meeting loan repayments due to unfavourable changes in their financial circumstances in the current economic environment.  Increasing the lending limit for credit unions and formalising arrangements in the area of rescheduling of loans will facilitate credit unions in their wish to ease the position of these members.  Accompanying requirements with regard to liquidity and provisioning will protect the financial stability of credit unions and ensure that the security of members&rsquo; savings is maintained.</P>
        <P>Item 2 replaces section 35(2) of the Credit Union Act 1997, changing the 20% limit, which applies to the total loans outstanding over five years, to a 30% limit.  Item 3 provides that the Central Bank may impose on credit unions requirements in relation to their lending practices.  This includes provisioning for bad and doubtful debt, liquidity requirements, controls and reporting.  The Registrar of Credit Unions will adopt a balanced and proportionate approach in the application of the loan provisioning requirements which are proposed to be introduced.  Depending on the circumstances, a missed repayment on a rescheduled loan may not always trigger a full provision against the loan provided that the credit union is satisfied that the loan continues to perform in accordance with its new terms.</P>
        <P>The new section 35B imposes on credit unions a requirement to have appropriate processes, procedures, systems, controls and reporting arrangements in place to monitor compliance with the requirements of section 35 and section 35A.  These counter-measures are required to balance against the greater risk attaching to increasing the lending limits and rescheduling loans.  Item 39 of Schedule 1 of the Bill explicitly underlines the importance of the work of the Registrar of Credit Unions through the requirement that the annual regulatory performance statement should include details of the activities carried out during the preceding year by the office-holder.</P>
        <P>I would like to refer now to a number of procedural matters.  As Deputies are aware, the Government is required to consult the European Central Bank on legislative proposals of this type.  In advancing work on the Bill, I particularly welcome the publication of the ECB&rsquo;s opinion on the Government&rsquo;s draft heads and I will make arrangements to lay the opinion before the House prior to consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I am keen to work closely with the ECB to ensure the best possible reform of the structures of the Central Bank of Ireland and this opinion is an important part of that process.</P>
        <P>I am also pleased to note the endorsement by the ECB of the general approach being taken by the Government.  There are no issues of principle for us in the opinion.  To the extent that issues have been raised, these have already been addressed in the final text of the Bill or can, if necessary, be dealt with as the Bill progresses through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>I should also inform the House that it is likely that I will be bringing forward amendments to the Bill on Committee stage.  I will give Deputies details of the amendments in advance and my officials will be available to brief Deputies on them as required.</P>
        <P>In my contribution, I stuck faithfully to the subject of this Bill.  Without wishing to pre-empt the contributions from the Deputies opposite, I can safely predict that in their contributions they will return to the issue of the State guarantee.  In that regard, I remind them of a very detailed and lengthy discussion of that matter that took place in committee on 26 February 2009.  I recently reread the transcript of that hearing and I believe it answers many of the questions that have again recently been raised by Members of this House.</P><Col N="447"/>
        <P>I look forward to hearing what the Deputies have to say about the Bill.  I am open to constructive suggestions and I will listen very carefully to any proposals that emerge.  This Bill is urgent and essential.  I am confident the approach we are taking is the correct one and that the new structures we are putting in place will help to ensure a robust regulatory system that will win confidence here at home and internationally.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann declines to give the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 a second reading because:</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">I. It has not been rooted in any proper investigation of what has gone wrong, nor any serious attempt to make key players accountable for the errors committed, both of which are necessary to determine whether this Bill is an appropriate response.</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">II. It infers that the most urgent reform is to change the architecture of the existing regulatory bodies, when there is no verifiable evidence that such architecture was in any significant way responsible for the shortcomings of the regulatory system.</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">III. It preserves the system of appointment of Directors to the new Central Bank Commission exclusively to Government with no proper scrutiny by the Oireachtas or any other external body.</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">IV. It does not give the new Commission the necessary &lsquo;bank resolution&rsquo; powers needed to put failed banks safely into a managed administration when that is the most appropriate policy outcome.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is sad to say that once again we are being asked by the Government to accept on faith that it knows best when it comes to what is to be done to resolve the banking crisis.  Here, it is telling us that, without any investigation of what went wrong, it knows exactly what the new architecture ought to be and knows what sort of engine will drive a new regulatory system, although it does not know the destination of the new regulatory system, which powers it needs, what it is to investigate or what it must hold to account.</P>
        <P>That is an extraordinary approach, that we start off by designing the engine and then find out what sort of terrain we must bring it across.  That, however, is the Government approach.  If we have learned one thing from the debate about banking to date it is that such faith in Government is simply not justified.  We must treat these faith-based solutions with extreme scepticism.</P>
        <P>We were told when the banking guarantee was introduced that it would be the cheapest bail-out of any country.  The Government then extended the guarantee to bond holders.  The present Governor of the Central Bank was explicit in his view that money that could leave the banking system &mdash; deposits &mdash; should have been guaranteed, and that the guarantee should have been extended to new investors entering the market in bonds for banks.  The Governor of the Central Bank is now regarded rightly by the Government as the source of some expertise in handling banking crises, but where was the consultation with him when this guarantee was designed?  It was supposed to be the cheapest bail-out of any country and is proving to be anything but.</P>
        <P>We were also told that we must keep Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide building society as going concerns and that such an approach was a pillar of a banking solution.  The estimate of the cost of keeping Anglo Irish Bank going was &euro;4 billion and we thought Irish <Col N="448"/>Nationwide might cost &euro;1 billion.  However, we know now Anglo Irish will cost &euro;22 billion, and rising, and the cost for Irish Nationwide is &euro;2.7 billion.  The truth is that 70% of the recapitalisation money we are sinking into those banks will not result in one red cent of new credit going to businesses that might build a future for this economy.  That is the reality but the Government continues to insist that these are banks and institutions of huge systemic importance that must be kept afloat at all costs.</P>
        <P>The third element of the banking strategy, on which we were given assurances time after time, was to trust NAMA because it would get credit flowing.  Yesterday we heard from Irish Nationwide Building Society that it will not get one ounce of credit going and it is clear that the &euro;2.7 billion will be used immediately to pay bondholders.  From the same stable that produced all these wonderful solutions to our banking crises and about which we are now learning the true cost, we have this latest prognosis.</P>
        <P>The important point is that this Bill is about ensuring this will never happen again and that never again should we have to cross this threshold.  It defies belief that we should start a &ldquo;never again&rdquo; process without knowing what went wrong and without having the results of the investigation.  The genesis of sorting out the architecture of the solution comes from the school of thought that says we should circle the wagons and get back to what is known as business as usual as quickly as possible.  That is what many people in the banking system want to happen.  They do not want a lot of awkward questions but want to get back to business as usual, blaming the problem on some kind of architecture that was misdesigned back in 2002.  They believe that whoever designed it back then got it wrong.  It was the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Mr. McCreevy, who designed it, with the help or hindrance of his colleagues, the then Deputy, Michael McDowell and Deputy Mary Harney, now Minister for Health and Children.  It was a camel produced by different groupings that came up with the idea.</P>
        <P>With my hand on my heart I can say we tabled a reasoned amendment at that stage, stating precisely what was wrong with this bit of financial regulation.  It involved taking a huge bulldog clip to a heap of powers that were centred in areas of enterprise and employment and in the Central Bank.  They were scattered through nine or ten different Bills.  The regulation put a big bulldog clip around these powers and posted them to the new agency, asking it to look after them.  Perhaps it was prophetic of me at the time but I said we needed to examine those powers to see whether they were up to regulatory best practice and capable of doing the job we were asking them to do.  Mr. McCreevy was in the Minister&rsquo;s seat and refused to allow that happen even though Enron and All First had broken around our ears.  The entire regulatory regime was seen to be challenged by weaknesses in corporate governance and the authors of the piece of legislation we are deciding now to change would not take the time to undertake that scrutiny.</P>
        <P>That said, nobody in their wildest dreams believes that our bipartite board &mdash; two different boards with largely overlapping representation; a regulatory authority that was slightly separated from the Central Bank &mdash; was the cause of this problem.  If the Minister believed that it would have been peppered everywhere in his speech that this was something with which we really must get to grips.  It did not happen because it was not the cause.  This makes me very suspicious of the thinking that is going on in official circles concerning what must be done to cure the situation.  The thinking is that we should make a few running repairs to what is going on and then press on at all costs.  That is not good enough.</P>
        <P>It is becoming clearer to the general public that we need transformative change in banking policy.  We need an entirely different culture to be applied in banking, one different from any we have seen.  As recently as this week we saw that this damaged and broken culture is alive and well and still kicking down in those banks.  They feel there is nothing unusual about finding <Col N="449"/>&euro;1.9 million for a pension fund for a chief executive, this at a time when people are losing their homes and their jobs and are having their pay cut.  They are unable to get by and the reason is the mismanagement of those very bank executives who think it is acceptable to push on and do what they always did.  There was an arrangement so they will stick to that arrangement.  That is not acceptable and the sooner people cop on, not only in Government but in the wider banking circle, that the public will not wear that the better it will be.</P>
        <P>People will not suck it up any more.  They want a change of culture and approach and they want it to start now.  They want accountability.  That is the most crucial point.  As people have pointed out, accountability is not about the Taoiseach saying he used the best advice at the time.  Accountability is about asking whether that advice was adequate, whether it was taken, whether it was based on proper research and whether the people who offered the advice were sound in their beliefs because they had consulted properly with all those who might have offered an alternative view.  It is about asking whether they tested the advice and offered it in good faith so that we could see it was adequate.  That is the chain of accountability but no such chain is being applied here.</P>
        <P>Coming up with this Bill is totally self-serving as far as the Central Bank and its role in the regulatory authority are concerned.  This is not accountability but solving a problem that was never greatly exposed as a problem.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the problem was the cosy circle.  Bankers believed they could do what they liked.  They could walk on water and it would come all right in the end because they were pumping up the property bubble at a great pace.  Regulators accepted on faith what their betters in the banks told them and never questioned it, never sought alternative advice.  They did not hold bankers up to proper scrutiny or probing as they ought to have done.  The Government did not only luxuriate in the company of these titans of the property bubble but also fuelled the bubble with inappropriate fiscal policy and tax policies.  Senior advisors &mdash; the permanent government of this State &mdash; were too much in thrall to the entire system and they, too, did not play their proper role of providing the right sort of expert advice to challenge what was going on or equipping themselves with the sort of advice that was necessary in the regime they were overseeing.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Yesterday the Irish Nationwide Building Society and its report reminded us of everything that was rotten.  Institutions were run as personal fiefdoms.  Even now, those who ran them have not suffered in any way or had any consequences for what has happened but the consequence for taxpayers, mortgage holders and people looking for jobs is extraordinary.  Ordinary people have been brought to their knees and they want accountability.  They want it now.  They will look to other countries to see what those countries have been doing.  They look to the United States where they see there are 42 bankers in jail and the banks are already paying back some of the money extended by government.  They look to Iceland where the prime minister, the minister for finance, the governor of the country&rsquo;s central bank and the head of the regulatory authority have all been found to be negligent by a justice of the supreme court.  Those cases in which they were found negligent are very similar to what we have seen in this country, such as the drive for short-term profits without regard to risk, cutting tax during a boom, policy makers ignoring an imbalance in the economy and increased risk taking in banks not being met with the appropriate regulatory response.  The list continues and is very close to what went on in this country.  However, in Iceland at least the people have a clear decision that there was negligence.  The finger has been pointed and there is accountability.  People can understand that and move on, hoping to be able to say they now know what went wrong and that they can design a structure so that it will never happen again.  Here we are being asked to accept a structure without that &ldquo;never again&rdquo; analysis.</P>

	<P>It would be great if the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, would stay to listen.  I have more faith in him than in many of the other Ministers.  I am very pleased to introduce a motion to the House on energy security.  It is my understanding that it is the first time in my political lifetime that there has been such a motion put before the House.  It is an effort to get on the political agenda an important issue which raises serious concerns about a potential future crisis that may hit the Irish economy because of its over-exposure to imported fossil fuels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the Deputy intends to share time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will share time, with the agreement of the House, with Deputies Clune, Doyle, Deenihan, D&rsquo;Arcy and McHugh.  Perhaps the Acting Chairman will let me know when I have used approximately 18 minutes of my time.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, has arrived.  This motion attempts to put the issue of energy security squarely on the Government agenda.  There has been a significant emphasis from this Minister and the Government on trying to shift the focus from carbon-emitting fuels to more sustainable ways of powering the economy.  The main driver for the Minister has been climate change and I want to attach equal, if not more, importance to energy security issues.  They are at least of equal importance as an issue looking to change the way we power Ireland from a transport, energy generation and heating supply perspective.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be familiar with two of the most recent reports which sum up the potential crisis that may hit Ireland because of our reliance on imported oil in particular, along with <Col N="452"/>imported gas.  The first is Energy Security: Ireland on the Edge, produced by the Ecology Foundation in January 2010, and the other is The Oil Crunch &mdash; A Wake-Up Call for the UK Economy, which was produced by the UK industry task force on peak oil and energy security.</P>
        <P>The report produced in the UK makes it quite clear that they are predicting and anticipating a dramatic price increase in oil over the next three to four years to well over $100 a barrel.  If this is combined with the Ireland on the Edge energy security report, one can see how vulnerable and ill-prepared we are for that type of oil spike in the not too distant future.  It can also be combined with our almost complete reliance on imported gas, as our gas fields off Kinsale are running out and we do not yet have gas coming ashore from Corrib.  We are perhaps the most exposed country in the OECD in our reliance on the import of fuel to power our homes, businesses and economy.</P>
        <P>We need to make plans today to ensure we address the risk that exists and slowly turn the ship around in changing our reliance on fossil fuels in order to move to a more sustainable future.  I know the Minister believes in that but my difficulty is that we have not seen a viable roadmap to get us there.  I hope that by 2025 there will have been a massive increase in renewables, along with interconnection and the required storage capacity.  There must be a bridging solution between now and then which will ensure that the Irish economy will not be exposed to supply or pricing concerns which are a real threat.</P>
        <P>We can examine the storage capacity which Ireland has in case of a disruption of supply in oil or gas.  We must reflect on the fact that 95% of all fuel used in Ireland is imported.  We have 55 days of oil stored, although the majority of it is not held on the island but in Britain.  We are reliant on Dublin Port being constantly open, as well as Whitegate refinery in Cork Harbour, should there be a crisis.  We must seriously consider increasing the capacity of oil storage on the island of Ireland so we can counteract the effects of a reduction in imported oil supply.</P>
        <P>The gas position is far worse as essentially, we have no strategic gas reserves in Ireland.  Bord G&aacute;is or any other gas supplier imports what is needed and can increase the pressure on the pipeline, giving a little extra supply.  Bord G&aacute;is keeps a small amount of reserves in small disused gas fields off Kinsale and it is estimated we have approximately 11 days of gas stored should the interconnectors between Ireland and Britain, which pipe gas into Ireland, shut down for a political or geological reason.  Many people would say we do not even have that much of a supply and Ireland&rsquo;s gas supply probably would not even last longer than a week if the import of gas were halted for any reason.  This is a very vulnerable position when one considers that more than 60% of our power generation in Ireland comes from gas.</P>
        <P>The day in the past five years when Ireland used most power was 7 January.  For the first time in a long time we used the second gas interconnector to approximately 30% capacity, along with the first interconnector to its maximum capacity, because we were importing so much gas.  It was a cold day and there was no wind so there was no generation capacity coming from wind turbines.  We were heavily reliant on gas, coal and peat in powering the country.  We are entirely reliant on imports for practically all that gas.</P>
        <P>What should we do as a result?  I hope the Minister will take my suggestions on board.  We must put financial incentives, or regulation, in place to require the industry to broaden risk.  We could be much more proactive in using disused gas fields and other storage potential that is available in Ireland should we choose to use it.  Ireland can use the gas pipeline infrastructure off the south coast of Ireland which feeds the Kinsale gas field for this purpose; it is happening already to some extent.  In the summer months Bord G&aacute;is pumps gas into some of the smaller <Col N="453"/>gas fields in order to increase pressure and allow usage in the autumn as more gas is required.  We need much more of this thinking.</P>
        <P>We must require electricity generators to increase back-up stocks.  Every gas powered station in Ireland &mdash; most of the newest, modern and most efficient electricity generators now operate on gas &mdash; should be required to hold oil reserves in case gas runs out.  They are required to so do for a five-day period, but this must be doubled to ten days.</P>
        <P>On the Corrib gas field, my clear position is that we need to bring gas ashore from off the west coast.  It is a resource for Ireland and issues such as the taxation arrangements some criticise or the amount of money Ireland as a country is making from the exploitation of its own gas resources, its relationship with Shell and so on can be debated on another day.  This debate is about energy security and the ability to bring large volumes of gas to the Irish market from a major gas field which I understand is approximately two thirds of the size of the Kinsale gas field and good for energy security in Ireland.  Its exploitation must be supported and encouraged and facilitated as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>As for liquid natural gas, for the first time in living memory there has been a complete divergence in pricing between oil and gas.  Gas no longer is priced depending on oil prices because huge new shale gas reserves have been discovered in the United States and Europe.  This has resulted in an oversupply of liquid natural gas globally and, consequently, cheap gas.  Moreover, it is likely that gas prices will fall even further in the next six months as oil prices increase beyond $85 per barrel towards $90 or $100 per barrel.  Even though this is good in respect of the security of supply, the State must do all it can to encourage the liquid natural gas storage facilities being proposed for Tarbert.  I note my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, is highly supportive of the project and will speak about it later.</P>
        <P>There is a huge opportunity, albeit untapped in Ireland as yet, to produce what is called biogas, primarily methane, from farm waste.  I refer, in particular, to slurry which is perceived to be a problem and methane which is a far more potent and damaging greenhouse gas than carbon.  We should begin to perceive such waste as a resource rather than as a pollutant.  There is much for the Minister to do to kick-start an industry that is a billion-euro industry in Germany where more than 4,000 anaerobic digesters on farms produce methane from slurry, grass and other farm produce and waste.  We should be doing this in Ireland because we grow grass better and have a capacity to do it more efficiently.  This constitutes an opportunity to give farmers a new source of income and wealth creation.  The Minister is familiar with the work under way in UCC, particularly that of Professor Jerry Murphy whom I consider to be Ireland&rsquo;s leading expert in this area.  I hope the Minister will be forthcoming with funding for a new pilot project on the Cork city landfill site for a planned new biogas anaerobic digester.  Moreover, I understand it will be co-sponsored by Bord G&aacute;is if approximately &euro;4 million can be found by the Government to make the project happen.</P>
        <P>This is an exciting potential income generator for farms nationwide because if there is one thing Irish farmers are good at, it is growing grass efficiently.  They have been doing it for years and continue to do so in the dairy and beef industries.  There is now an opportunity to generate new income from this crop.  Ireland has a natural competitive advantage over other countries in the European Union that are generating huge sums of money and income for rural communities by dealing with waste in a far more environmentally-friendly way than spreading it on land, which is what happens with most slurry.  I strongly encourage the Minister to promote and support through taxation, financial incentives and export tariff mechanisms, in particular, efforts to make this industry a reality in Ireland as it already is elsewhere in Europe in countries that are not as good at growing grass.  This could pertain to selling biogas to the gas network or generating electricity from biogas and selling it back to the network.</P><Col N="454"/>
        <P>I wish to shift the focus slightly onto Ireland&rsquo;s fuel mix and discuss briefly the need, from a security point of view, to move from spending money on imported oil, gas and coal to spending it in Ireland in a far more effective manner to create jobs, support rural communities and, most importantly, shift the risk away from reliance on imported fossil fuels to generating our own indigenous fuel in Ireland.  I welcome the new legislation that Members probably will be debating tomorrow or on Thursday in respect of the obligation scheme that after July will require all petrol and diesel in Ireland to have a 4% bio-fuel mix which may be ethanol or biodiesel.  However, much more must be done to promote the indigenous production of such bio-fuel on the island of Ireland because, as the Minister is aware, even though a market is being created for bio-fuel in Ireland by introducing this welcome obligation, it is being filled with imported bio-fuel to an unacceptable extent.  We must be much more aggressive and proactive about supporting the industry in Ireland which is waiting to take off.  Moreover, this does not simply pertain to agriculture either.  We must also consider waste much more constructively to ascertain how methane or ethanol can be produced from it.  Some of the projects I have studied, as I am sure has the Minister, have exciting potential.</P>
        <P>Biomass has even more potential than liquid bio-fuel.  I spoke at an energy conference in Cavan last night at which the viability of growing miscanthus and willow for wood biomass burners in the county was considered, with an expert from Teagasc.  The exciting point about this is that willow and miscanthus grow on wet land that otherwise is difficult to farm and, consequently, there is no threat to food supplies.  There is much that can be done in respect of bio-fuel and biomass crops in Ireland without affecting food supply because of the types of lands suitable for this purpose.  Moreover, there are good examples of this happening in Ireland.  For example, Johnson &amp; Johnson which I often cite as a good example in my constituency receives trailer-loads of willow wood biomass which is grown in west Waterford and supplied on a weekly basis to a combined heat and power plant in Johnson &amp; Johnson using a very competitive pricing model that should and can be replicated nationwide.  The State has a central role in providing the market a guaranteed price for crops such as miscanthus and willow, as well as thinnings from forestry, to make wood biomass a huge industry in Ireland.  A total of &euro;400 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent per year in importing fossil fuel to heat public buildings in Ireland such as schools, libraries, this Chamber, hospitals and many others.  We should enter into a roll-out programme for combined heat and power generating plants in all these buildings and source the fuel material from Irish farms to make this happen.</P>
        <P>The big idea from the Government in moving away from reliance on fossil fuels pertains to wind energy, in particular.  I acknowledge the wave, solar and other technologies but as my time is running out, I wish to concentrate on wind power. We have a fundamental problem in meeting our target of building enough turbines to generate approximately 6,000 MW, which is what we will require if we are to achieve the 40% target set by the Minister in terms of the renewable proportion of energy generation.  Gate 3 is a flawed way to deal with grid connections.  Under our current system, if an investor already in Ireland or coming to Ireland finds the ideal site for a wind farm, he or she has no chance of getting a grid connection within six to seven years because he or she would need to join a queuing system.  We need to switch over to a model whereby every proposed wind farm is assessed on its merits alone rather than on how long it has been in the system.  Its merits should be judged in terms of wind speed, proximity, cost, bankability, technology and so on.  These should be the sole criteria.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter.</P>
        <P>The Government needs help in rolling out the grid infrastructure that will be necessary to make the new energy future a reality.  We in this party will try to give the Minister that help <Col N="455"/>as long as he considers the technologies and potential other solutions with an open mind in respect of discussions on whether infrastructure should be underground or overground, the costing implications of that and so on.  My time is up, so I will raise my other issues at the end of the debate tomorrow night.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Clune has four minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak for even four minutes on this debate, which has a particular emphasis on energy security and security of supply.  The past week has brought home to us all how vulnerable we are as an island nation.  We need to focus on the fact that we must develop our self-sufficiency.  The water shortage before Christmas highlighted a lack of storage and interconnectivity and poor planning for a crisis.</P>
        <P>In this debate on energy, we are focusing on how vulnerable we are.  We do not want to be exposed to energy shortages.  Since we are a nation that is almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels, we need to change our strategy and focus on how to meet our European and international commitments to climate change.  Many debates in the House have highlighted the cost of electricity <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> our competitors and the absolute need to keep those costs down to ensure that, as an exporting nation, we return to being competitive.  It is essential that in all our decision making and policy formation in respect of the energy sector, particularly electricity, a price impact analysis is also considered.  This consideration must always be with us, as must our consideration of how to reduce our dependence on carbon-emitting fuels.</P>
        <P>We produce the most expensive electricity in Europe.  The Celtic tiger years saw a clear divergence between Irish and European industrial electricity prices.  The same is true in terms of domestic energy.  We need to diversify, change and plan for our future.  In the long term, we must plan on how to use our primary fuels.  We are one of the greatest users of natural gas for electricity generation in the EU.  The strategy to generate 40% of our electricity through renewables by 2020 must be supported.  Wind probably comprises the largest target in this regard and must be supported in the form of appropriate storage facilities.  Given the intermittent nature of wind, there is not necessarily a high wind factor at times of high demand.  The options, be they pump storage or compressed air storage, must form part of an economic and technical feasibility study of our wind generation concepts.</P>
        <P>If 40% of energy is to be generated via renewables by 2020, what of the balance?  Will the mix include coal or gas?  Will we reduce our dependence on oil?  If we are to continue as we have been, we will most likely become dependent on gas.  Given geopolitical considerations, we could be exposed to a major energy security risk.  By 2030, the North Sea fields will be depleted, after which we will depend on gas from politically unstable regions such as the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and north Africa.  Natural gas accounts for 20% of our energy demand, oil 56%, coal 9%, renewables 3% and peat 4%.  Some 65% of our energy comes from natural gas.  It is used by 700,000 homes for heating and cooking.  Some 90% of this gas is imported through the UK.  While my party welcomes that the Corrib field will come on stream, the latter will only supply approximately 50% of our needs initially, a figure that will quickly reduce to 20% after three or four years, which will increase our dependence on imports.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to focus on the diversification of supply.  Liquefied natural gas would be an important factor in this regard, as would the other sources mentioned by Deputy Coveney.  We also need to develop gas storage facilities so that 20% of our annual natural gas usage is stored, be it in disused fields or salt caves.  These are the types of policy we must consider now.  Above all, an emphasis on the economics of whatever strategy we <Col N="456"/>develop will be important if we, as an exporting nation, are serious about keeping our energy costs down.  They have a significant impact on the cost of the services and products we export.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy Coveney on tabling this motion and on his work in this area.  He is to the forefront as an expert in this regard.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that the Minister signed a foreshore licence for the Shannon LNG project today.  I welcome this sincerely.  As he knows, the project was announced in May 2006 and will provide liquid natural gas at the Tarbert-Ballylongford landbank.  In September 2007, the company applied for planning permission for a terminal.  Its application was lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and fast-tracked and planning permission was granted in March 2008.  In April 2008, an application was made for a foreshore licence, but its granting took almost two years.  It was a slow process.  I hope that the granting of further foreshore licences will not take as long, as this project was held up for almost two years.  However, I welcome the fact that it has been delivered today.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise a few issues with the Minister.  Shannon LNG got planning permission to provide a pipe from Foynes to the landbank.  At the same time, Bord G&aacute;is is considering another pipe to service Endesa, which is converting the Tarbert oil-burning station into a gas-fired station.  It is ridiculous that two pipes would be provided to the same area.  Will the Minister knock heads together and get people to agree on a single pipe?</P>
        <P>Shannon LNG applied to the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, in September 2008 for an exemption from third party use of the terminal.  The CER published a consultative document and I understand that the exemption has been granted.  It is a welcome departure.  Shannon LNG would not normally have constructed a pipeline until the terminal was close to completion, but it is important to point out that, subject to certain undertakings, it has offered to build a pipeline early to accommodate any third party&rsquo;s requirements.  It is prepared to build a pipeline to accommodate Endesa provided it receives certain assurances.</P>
        <P>It is important that an assurance to the effect that if the project does not proceed &mdash; which is highly unlikely &mdash; the company will be compensated in respect of its investment.  It would be easy to provide such an assurance.  If the pipeline is provided, not only will it service the operations of Endesa on Tarbet Island, it will also service Listowel and Tralee.  It will also lead to gas being brought into County Kerry for the first time.  As far as I am aware, Kerry is one of the only counties &mdash; Donegal is another &mdash; to which gas is not provided.  The county is at a considerable disadvantage as a result.  An opportunity exists in this regard.  I thank Endesa and Shannon LNG for initiating this exciting project.</P>
        <P>An extremely interesting document on microgeneration was published in the UK recently.  The document in question refers to the use of feed-in tariffs, with which the Minister is probably familiar, to encourage small-scale, low-carbon generation.  It is expected that the scheme in the UK will, by 2020, support over 750,000 small-scale, low-carbon electricity installations and will have saved 7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.  What is happening in the UK in respect of feed-in tariffs could be replicated in Ireland in the immediate future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Coveney for tabling this motion.  The need for it is borne out of both frustration and necessity.  We have a major dependence on imported fossil fuels, which constitute a finite resource.  Ireland is at the end of the supply chain, regardless of whether it is importing such fuels from the east or the west.</P>
        <P>The original programme for Government that was published in 2007 included provision for the establishment of a Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and energy security and of <Col N="457"/>the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, of which Deputies Coveney and McManus and I are members.  The joint committee has made progress in respect of various initiatives, particularly those relating to electric vehicles, the heads of a Bill on climate change and a foreshore licensing Bill, which was presented to the Government approximately one year ago.  The latter Bill, which appears to have become lost between two or three Departments, puts forward a proper plan for offshore alternative energy projects to be licensed and allowed to proceed without environmental impact statements being obtained for each one.  The legislation in question is progressive and enjoys the support of all parties.  Since it was sent to Government it has been left to languish in one of the Departments but I am not sure which one.</P>
        <P>I wish to concentrate on microgeneration, particularly the area of biogas.  In March 2008 the European Parliament adopted a resolution &mdash; in the form of an opinion, rather than a proposal for legislation &mdash; on sustainable agriculture and biogas and the need for a review of the relevant EU legislation.  It was stressed at the time that, in the long term, renewable energy sources such as biogas and biofuels, together with solar and wind energy, offer the possibility of enjoying a higher degree of independence from the fossil fuel industry.</P>
        <P>One of our main issues with the Minister and his colleagues in the Green Party is that they are focusing on the area of agricultural emissions as a high percentage of our total emissions.  By adopting anaerobic digestion, for example, it is possible to mitigate huge amounts of the methane emissions from the agricultural sector by harvesting and harnessing the energy produced from said methane.  The joint committee received a presentation on this matter and recommended to the Minister that the renewable energy feed-in tariff be brought into line with that of Europe and that it be index linked.  As far as I am aware, the joint committee has not yet received a response to its correspondence on this matter.</P>
        <P>We set aside &euro;50 million in 2009 in respect of the provision of carbon emission fines.  That is a complete waste of money.  We could have invested the money in developing a smart metering system or facilitating a review of the planning regulations in order to support the development of microgeneration.  We could have used those funds in a much better way.  The policy that is currently in place is moving us towards a 20% renewable energy resource but we are not planning for this.</P>
        <P>I wish to provide a simple example in this regard.  Some 40% of the expenses incurred by those involved in horticulture who use glasshouses arise as a result of energy requirements.  These people have a huge biodegradable waste facility at their disposal but there is no capital investment on offer to them in order that they might develop microgeneration and anaerobic digestion projects.  The latter could meet most of their heating costs and thereby reduce the overall cost of producing fruit and vegetables.  This would allow us to compete, to retain jobs and to supply Irish-produced fruit and vegetables to supermarkets rather than importing them from Spain and elsewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Coveney on the work he continues to do in this area and on putting forward this motion, which is proactive in nature and which offers suggestions to the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I previously worked as a geography teacher and I recall that when my students opened their books to the chapter on energy security and fossil fuels and what might happen in the future, they found the subject unexciting, uninteresting and boring because it did not reflect reality.  However, we are now living in the post-oil era and a new reality has emerged.  In recent weeks people have begun to panic because they are being obliged to pay, on average, an additional &euro;50 in respect of an order of 1,000 litres of home heating oil.  They are panicking because many of them cannot afford to pay the extra cost.  People have also begun to use green diesel illegally <Col N="458"/>as a result of their not being able to afford the alternative.  Reality is beginning to bite because people, farmers included, can no longer afford to purchase these fuels.  We put forward a suggestion to the Minister at the time of the budget that farmers should have been excluded from the additional carbon tax on farm fuel.  However, that suggestion was ignored.</P>
        <P>Those who are currently studying geography in schools have their classrooms heated by radiator systems which burn oil in order to produce such heat.  The Minister could take the lead in respect of this matter.  Why, as Deputy Coveney inquired, are we not considering, in respect of Government buildings, public libraries and offices and schools which close at 4.30 p.m. or 5 p.m., of creating electric storage facilities that could be fuelled at night-time.  That is a simple suggestion and it would provide a solution with regard to our needs in respect of public buildings.  At 8 a.m. each day, prior to public buildings opening, oil must be burned in order to produce heat.  We could, however, put in place electricity storage facilities whereby such buildings could be heated through the night and this would ensure that costs would be reduced.</P>
        <P>We should also consider the lead taken by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in respect of hydrogen, electrolysis and fuel cell technology.  In the UK, a great deal of research has been carried out at the universities of Warwick, Nottingham, Leicester and Birmingham in respect of the latter technology.  We should be taking the lead in this regard and our third level sector should be examining the possibility of developing fuel cell technology as a solution to our problems.  The Minister will state that this is already the case but not enough is being done.  The reality is that there are many possibilities and permutations to be considered with regard to advancing alternative technologies and systems in the interests of ensuring energy security and safeguarding energy production.</P>
        <P>On one day alone last summer, 1,000 MW of energy were imported to Paris from the United Kingdom.  This was due to the fact that temperatures in France were so high at the time that it was not possible for nuclear energy to be produced for a period of two weeks.  We need to fast track that interconnector between Ireland and Wales and be in a position to export our energy.  We need to think outside the box.  Rather than pinning farmers against the wall in terms of overhead pylons and so on, why do we not look at running this under the sea and at perhaps running it from Dublin to Moneypoint where we have a 400 kV line and up the west coast to Ballyshannon?  The problem with this Government is very simple.  A Government that will not take responsibility for the past is certainly not in a position to take responsibility for the future, especially in terms of energy security.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael Party motion is well constructed and I would not disagree fundamentally with much of the analysis Deputy Coveney presented.  It is crucial we start to debate and understand this issue of energy security within the context of good energy policy being set and getting clean, competitive and secure energy sources.  We are always trying to get those three legs of the stool right but we could add a fourth leg.  Recently, I have started <Col N="460"/>to change my thinking.  The fourth leg is the country&rsquo;s balance of payments.  I guess it is part of competitiveness but we want to reduce the amount of money we spend on energy imports and increase our exports.  We could say there are four legs on the stool.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been acutely apprised of the energy security issue.  Anyone who grew up in the 1970s and pushed the car to the petrol station had that hard-wired into his or her brain.  Anyone who read &ldquo;Limits to Growth&rdquo;, as I did as a teenager, had the clear understanding that this century would be defined by resource limits.</P>
        <P>My thinking on energy security was further developed or honed eight or nine years ago.  A very important conference was held in the Tipperary Institute which, I think, was organised by Richard Douthwaite from Feasta, the foundation for economic self-sustainability.  A speaker at that conference was Colin Campbell, a former geologist, who had worked in the seas around Ireland looking for oil.  He had also worked in Colombia and a range of different locations.  As an independent expert, a geologist, who had worked for many of the oil companies but who no longer had any interest in them or in oil exploration, I found his analysis carried a certain weight.  It was independent and he did not have a vested interest.  He was surrounded by a collection of similar experts from all over the world, including Jean Laherr&egrave;re from France who, I think, had worked for Elf, the French oil company, Chris Grabowski, the editor of one of the main petroleum magazines who has been quite brave in terms of saying it as it is, Matt Simmons from the USA and a range of other people who were part of what one might call that peak oil community.  It is a community which has got it right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A representative from Shell or one of the large oil companies at that conference eight or nine years ago said that this was all nonsense, that there was no shortage of oil, that we would be fine until 2050 and that even then we would find something else.  At that time, the official sources of the International Energy Agency were scathing in their criticism of the likes of Colin Campbell and the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, what has happened in the intervening eight or nine years is interesting.  The geological reality has become increasingly apparent.  We face a world not in which oil will disappear overnight but in which it will become increasingly scarce.  We will face a peak, if we do not face it already, followed by a contraction in availability, in particular of light sweet crude oil which has powered our civilisation for the past 100 years.  There is much shale oil left in Alberta, Canada, in Venezuela and elsewhere but it takes almost as much energy to get that out of the ground and huge volumes of water which are not readily available.</P>
        <P>Nothing will be as good as oil.  We will never have an energy resource which is as energy dense, transportable and as useful as oil.  It is stored solar energy, stored for 150 million years.  It is the perfect solar energy in terms of its energy density and transportability.  Jonathan Porrit said recently that three tablespoons of oil is the equivalent of eight man hours of energy.  Deputy Ferris knows what it is like to haul a net.  If he did that for eight hours, three tablespoons of oil would give one that energy.  It is phenomenal energy material.  However, it is clear we face a peak in global oil production and that this planet faces a fundamental challenge to provide oil for its people in a world where it is no longer as freely or as cheaply available.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very much apprised of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas and the need for us to act now.  Reality has caught up.  A year and a half ago, I invited over Fatih Birol of the International Energy Agency and brought in the senior civil servants from across the public service and told them to listen to him.  In its 2008 report, the most conservative energy agency said our dependence on oil was utterly unsustainable, that the age of cheap oil was over and that governments must act now.  This report could not have been more stark.  It did a field by field analysis which had not been done previously.  Many lies are told in the oil industry.  When <Col N="461"/>the IEA started to look beneath the surface of what people had been saying and at the reality, there was a stark warning to every government which has continued since that we must rid ourselves of our dependency on oil, in particular.</P>
        <P>That drives the European Union.  We see it across the board.  Energy Ministers are all pretty much appraised of this.  It complements what we are doing on climate change.  The 2020 strategy is a strong, mandatory approach from the European Union and it is backed up because Energy Ministers, Heads of Government and last but not least Finance Ministers are starting to understand this reality and react to it.</P>
        <P>The promise at the inauguration of the new President in the US was to harness the sun, wind and soil to power its cars and run its factories.  The US gets it.  It is an oil economy and a country which got rich on the back of oil resources.  It peaked in 1976 and it now imports 15 million barrels a day of the 20 million barrels a day it consumes.</P>
        <P>China gets it.  I was at one of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas conferences six or seven years ago.  The top person in the Chinese oil company was there and all he said in his speech was that China will need a lot of oil and gas.  It is now buying it around the world.  The estimate from the IEA is that in 2030, China will import the same amount of oil America is now importing.  I do not see from where it will come.  I do not believe there is a miracle source we will discover so, therefore, we must act.</P>
        <P>This country must act.  We consume 165,000 barrels of oil a day.  That is ten pints of oil for every man, woman and child every day.  Think of the energy in that.  We do not see it because it goes to food production, transport systems, fertilisers, petrol, heating systems and industrial production.  It is a lot of oil.  This is one of the most oil dependent countries in the world.</P>
        <P>I appreciate Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s motion because it gives us a chance to set out that reality to the people.  One of the first reactions is to provide storage so that if there is another energy crisis, like in the 1970s, we have something to cover us.  That is why NORA is compelled to hold approximately 90 days oil stocks for the country.  Currently, it holds 84 days in gasoline and 78 days in the distilled equivalent with the remainder coming from private industry.  Currently, approximately 85% of that is in real oil stocks and approximately 15% is in tickets and stock tickets.  As Deputy Coveney said, approximately 45% is held in Ireland and 40% abroad.  However, we have given NORA a serious amount of resources to ensure 70% of our stocks are held here.  We are looking at a range of different solutions to increase our capability in that regard and we have given NORA real resources to do that job.</P>
        <P>In terms of gas, Deputy Coveney is right that there has been a change in the past couple of years.  Forever and a day, gas prices followed oil prices but there has been a divergence in recent times because of the development of the hydrovacing of shale gas in certain areas in the United States.  We should be careful as to whether it is a complete game change.  The EPA in the United States is starting a two year study on the implications of this for the water table and water pollution.  The level of resources is also not yet clear.  It is true, however, that the development of this shale gas resource changed the spot market price in the United States and, by dint of that, the world market price for gas.  It has also resulted in a change in the LNG business in that tankers which previously travelled across the Atlantic may no longer have a reason to do so.  This has created a certain flexibility in the market which has helped to reduce prices.</P>
        <P>Ireland should not be complacent in this regard given that gas accounts for one quarter of our energy use.  Approximately two thirds of Ireland&rsquo;s gas consumption is used in electricity production where it accounts for approximately 60% of our electricity.  We are, therefore, highly dependent on imported gas, especially for electricity.  Between 95% and 97% of Ireland&rsquo;s <Col N="462"/>gas is imported, largely from the North Sea.  North Sea gas peaked about five or six years ago and estimates show that even by 2017, within ten or 15 years of North Sea production having peaked, the United Kingdom will import 70% of its gas needs.  The figure for Ireland is likely to match the British figure.</P>
        <P>While the immediate reliance for imports will probably be on Norway, its gas resource is relatively limited on a European scale.  Ireland would then be dependent on LNG or Russian or Algerian gas supplies.  Ireland&rsquo;s energy security is, therefore, under threat owing to our dependence on imported gas.  This was evident during the Russia-Ukraine gas crisis.  While the crisis did not affect Ireland directly, Europe was very much aware of the problem.  It changed the consciousness of the European Council of Ministers which now seeks to develop an alternative strategy in which Europe is less divided and we provide ourselves with a series of security systems to protect against gas supply shortages.</P>
        <P>The motion is correct on the need to increase our gas protection and we are doing what is set out in that regard.  Citing the example of power plants, Deputy Coveney argues that we must increase storage from five to ten days.  I agree and one option we are considering is to have some of the NORA distillate stocks, which are usable in gas fired power stations, become complementary.  We could use these stocks to help us meet the storage requirements in our power stations and give us the extra buffer we need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister consider giving NORA responsibility for our strategic gas supply? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are examining that issue.  The European Union is moving towards introducing statutory requirements on a regulatory system for gas storage.  I hope this will be done by July 2010.  The Commission for Energy Regulation, NORA and the Department have a crucial role in this regard.  We will have to consider introducing primary legislation to set out the mechanism within which gas storage regulation is carried out.  I believe it will involve NORA, the CER and the Department.  We are apprised of this issue and are working on it, among a range of other projects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must concentrate on the steps we can take to address the concern we have on the supply side.  I propose to set out some of the measures being taken.  The first emphasis should always be on efficiency.  One puts in the plug if one wishes to fill a bath.  In the same manner, one must make efficiency, the equivalent of the bath plug, the first priority.  One of the first steps we took in government was to improve building standards, recognising that what was built in the past 20 or 30 years was as if the 1970s had not happened.  A fundamental historical flaw of the past two or three decades was to allow the wrong buildings to be constructed.  The buildings of this period were not fit for our climate, nor were they designed to keep in heat or cut out carbon.  We changed the position immediately when we entered government.  We are in the process of changing it again by revising Part L of the building regulations to use the breathing space that has been caused, unfortunately, by the property crash to reconfigure the building industry.  We want the industry to work towards passive housing standards and ensure new buildings are fit for purpose.  We are working on this issue, for example, through the retrofit programmes we introduced.</P>
        <P>A few months ago, when the International Energy Agency met to discuss the issue of energy security, US Secretary of State Stephen Chu lauded his country&rsquo;s stimulus package which included a $400 million programme for retrofitting buildings.  At the time, I noted that we have the guts of &euro;100 million in our budget for these types of projects this year and our population <Col N="463"/>is much less than one quarter that of the United States.  The 50,000 or 60,000 houses being retrofitted this year is only a beginning.  We need to increase the figure to 100,000.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputies opposite that students should not be required to sit on oil fired radiators in classrooms.  We need to use the period when the construction industry is down to get it back on its feet by enabling it to make our buildings fit for purpose.  This is what we are doing.</P>
        <P>I also concur with Deputies opposite on the need to consider biomass, bio-gas and CHP as part of the solution.  The Irish farming sector has an opportunity to play its part in the solution, including in the provision of micro-generation.  Work remains to be done in this area.  We are working on a bio-energy strategy which I hope to publish shortly.  I have indicated to the industry that I recognise that the 19 cent support price for the first 3,500 kilowatt hours produced by micro-generation is not sufficient to encourage Irish farmers to sell power back to the system.  We must take a number of measures.  I welcome any and all suggestions or support in this regard.</P>
        <P>One must always battle with the Departments of Finance or Enterprise, Trade and Employment when trying to get new industries up and running or setting a price support to help overcome supply chain disadvantages.  One such disadvantage is that one has an oil fired burning system in place for 100 years with a range of supply materials ready for use in it.  If we are to provide an alternative and get an anaerobic digestion, micro-generation, CHP or biomass fed system up and running, we must have scale.  This requires the provision of support prices.  Doing this, however, raises concerns &mdash; correctly in many senses &mdash; in the Department of Finance and elsewhere that it may have an effect on energy prices.  I do not believe that will be the case.</P>
        <P>We have a five year window of opportunity during which gas prices are likely to be low owing to the shale gas issue to make the switch and support new technologies.  I am committed to doing this.  At every meeting I attend, I point out that this approach is not politically contested and the only point of contention is the speed at which we are moving.  Industry has the benefit of knowing that irrespective of the outcome of a future election or the configuration of a future Government, there is political agreement to move in a local, sustainable, renewable direction.</P>
        <P>On electricity, I listened to Deputy Coveney and accept that Gate 3 is a complicated system.  When I spoke to Michael Walsh of the Irish Wind Energy Association I asked whether, given its complexity, Gate 3 was the right approach to delivering on this issue.  He stated that while it was complicated, it was fundamentally correct and we should proceed with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>His members are in the queue. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Mr. Walsh recognises that the biggest constraint is the grid.  One could take the approach outlined by Deputy Coveney and assess which sites are better before delivering but if the grid is not in place, the number of good sites is irrelevant.  We must, first and foremost, build the grid around which Gate 3 is based. </P>
        <P>I welcome Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s statement that he is wiling to support the development of the grid, subject to others being willing to support the different options.  I have always done this.  For example, I employed a range of consultants to examine the underground options.  This approach must continue in any Bord Plean&aacute;la hearing system to ensure all options are considered.  Ultimately, however, the grid must be built.  While we have met our 15% target for renewables and reached second or third place in Europe in terms of integration of wind in our system &mdash; we are heading towards first place in this respect &mdash; we will not make progress unless we build our grid to tap into the potential resources available to us.  This is a precursor to the <Col N="464"/>wider and larger strategy set out in the Oireachtas committee two weeks ago of Ireland becoming an energy exporter.</P>
        <P>I fully support the offshore option to which Deputy McHugh referred.  While it is part of our export potential, it will not solve our transmission grid problem on land.  We need a transmission grid to County Donegal, not only to enable us to transmit wind power from that county but also to create jobs in the county.  The new data centre jobs which are coming to Donegal and elsewhere require that a grid is in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McHugh referred to laying a DC line to connect Donegal.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is all very well but if we want to create jobs, we also need an AC transmission line in counties Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.  There is an increasing correlation between a good electricity system and good employment.  It is not only a matter of tapping into resources but also bringing jobs to the counties in question.  For this reason, we must ensure a transmission system is built as quickly as possible.</P>
      
        <P>I concur with Deputy Doyle that the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security has done good work on electric vehicles.  The reality is that by dint of the agreements we have made with car companies from around the world, the work being done by the ESB and the support given by the Government, we are now placed to be one of the first countries to roll out a national EV network and get many of the economic benefits that come from that.</P>
        <P>There has also been an increase in investment in information and communications technology and energy efficiency.  The IBM smart grid centre is coming here rather than elsewhere, and that is real and is happening.  The bio-fuels obligation system is fitting within the European system, and this shows we are doing it.</P>
        <P>We should be openly critical of each other.  I picked up the &ldquo;NewERA&rdquo; document and while I agree with Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s aspiration of where we need to go, I fundamentally disagree with the document&rsquo;s approach.  I do not agree that we will improve our energy security by selling the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is.  If anything, I have seen the benefits that accrue from having certain control.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not proposing to sell the ESB.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>

	<P>The big value is in our electricity and gas grids, and I do not believe we should sell them.  There is no energy security benefit in selling our State assets in that way.  Neither do I believe there is a benefit in bringing our companies together into one office in the Department of the Taoiseach.  It do not believe it will work nor will it be more efficient.  The figure of &euro;18 billion that is being cited actually grasps the scale of the opportunity.  I saw Mr. Peter Brennan speak recently on behalf of the energy group on the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  He cited the fact that taking a ten-year view, there is already a &euro;75 billion investment plan being spent.  This combines the &euro;22 billion commitment by the ESB, the &euro;5 billion commitment by Bord G&aacute;is, the &euro;4 billion to be spent on EirGrid, and the &euro;16 billion that will be developed in the private wind energy sector.</P>

        <P>I commend the motion because it raises a crucial issue.  I disagree fundamentally with the Fine Gael approach, but I commend the Deputy on raising an issue that needs to be considered by all sides of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the motion, to which there are many commendable aspects and which concentrates our minds on a very important issue, namely, to ensure we have energy security.  I am a bit disappointed the issue of energy security is taken in isolation.  I always tend to put peak oil, energy security and climate change into the same area, and we cannot address one of these three issues without bringing in the other two.  The motion before us does not touch sufficiently on climate change or on peak oil.  It seems&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are trying to switch the focus onto an area that is not getting focus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fair enough and it is valuable to focus our attention on that area, but I would tend not to isolate the issue from the other two and it is worth considering all three of them at the same time.  It is useful to draw people&rsquo;s attention to the challenges we face.  As we have seen over the past week, things can quickly change about assumptions that might have previously been taken for granted.  We need to bring back on board Irish natural gas and to look at electricity interconnection issues.  I welcome this.  However, there is a tendency to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds when in Opposition.  I can give three examples of that.</P>
        <P>The Deputy called for an increase in critical supplies of energy from five days to ten, which is a very valuable thing.  However, it is not that long ago that he was harassing the Minister to lower energy prices in electricity and elsewhere.  A balance must be struck between bringing in the appropriate reductions and also storing energy for future use.  I do not think the Deputy can hammer us for not lowering prices and at the same time demand the imposition of very direct and substantial costs on the electricity producers and the oil distributors in the first instance.  That is one example.</P>
        <P>Another example is the call to expand and renew the grids nationwide.  We have had a very public campaign in Meath and elsewhere about planning issues in respect of new pylons for the distribution of electricity to and from the north west.  I understand members of Fine Gael have sided strongly with protesters on this issue, yet we need to reinforce the grid dramatically.  We need to renew the grid that already exists, yet there seems to be support at local level from the two main parties in Opposition for the points made by the community.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="466"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>They are public representatives.  They are entitled to work with communities to alleviate concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that public representatives must work with the community they represent, but we need leadership on the energy security and climate change issue.  We have to marry the concerns of local communities about planning with the need to address the three concerns I mentioned earlier.</P>
        <P>The third example is in the area of transportation.  The Green Party has argued long and hard for stronger investment in public transport.  We are transforming the bus system in Government, with straighter routes and better information to the end users.  We need all of that to happen and we need to shift the capital investment away from a position where the vast bulk goes into roads to a position where the bulk of the money goes into public transport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Why are bus routes being cut?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This will happen over the next few years, but it will not happen if Deputy McManus from the Labour Party argues for an outer orbital motorway running from Dundalk across to the Wicklow mountains.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is reducing expenditure on buses and the Green Party is in the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not going to happen when the Fine Gael Party argues for yet more motorway investment.  If we are to make public transport work, we must make the capital investment.  There have been reductions in expenditure on roads and in general expenditure, but if the two Opposition parties believe that when the money comes back, we should invest it all in roads, then we will not address the energy security issues, the peak oil issues and the climate change issues.  Let us not run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.</P>
        <P>While I accept that Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s concerns are genuine, we must look at how we are to reduce energy use.  I commend him on his work in researching the move towards electricity in transportation, but this should not be about electric Range Rovers.  It should be about smaller cars that use less energy and about how we can travel less and produce more with less energy.  The post-peak oil, energy secure, climate change agenda must be about using resources wisely.  I do not see enough of that in this motion.</P>
        <P>I accept the Deputy wants to focus his attention exclusively on the energy security issue and I commend him on that.  However, I have a little difficulty with the lack of a great attempt to address the energy conservation issue in the thrust of his motion.  It would be remiss of me to make the polemical point that we need to address energy security without ensuring that we put significant resources into energy conservation.  That may be in the Houses of the Oireachtas where we are moving over to using wood-pellet boilers and greater energy management, or the kind of measures my colleagues in Cabinet are taking to encourage householders to save money and have better heated homes, or in many other initiatives the Government is producing.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Fine Gael motion, although I feel the Government amendment encapsulates the issues to a greater extent.  I thank Deputy Coveney and others for their interest in this issue this evening.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I find this debate quite puzzling.  I have listened intently to both Ministers and after all their effusive compliments about the motion framed by Deputy Coveney, I did not get what their problem is with it and why they cannot support it.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, told us how they welcomed the motion, but the only inkling I got was a misunderstanding concerning Fine Gael&rsquo;s &ldquo;NewEra&rdquo; economic stimulus plan.  I have a difficulty with the &ldquo;NewEra&rdquo; document but I do not have a difficulty with this motion because all it seeks is to frontload investment in domestic energy infrastructure.  I have a difficulty with the approach of these two Government Ministers.  They are so stuck in a rut that when a good motion comes forward outlining the essential problems we face in the pending energy crisis, they cannot bring themselves to accept it.  If they were more seasoned and experienced Ministers they might have the good grace to adopt a good idea when they see one.  I am sure Deputy Coveney would be happy to withdraw the phrase as outlined in Fine Gael&rsquo;s &ldquo;NewEra&rdquo; economic stimulus plan, if it upsets the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  We have a problem, however, in that the Green Ministers cannot let go of the idea that somehow they have the Holy Grail and that nobody else can think as well or as smartly about energy issues as they can.</P>
        <P>May I tell the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, what he should be doing?  If he has a problem with the number of roads being built in this country he should talk to his colleague, the Minister for Transport.  I did not suggest an outer orbital route, but the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, did.  He proposed to finish it before it got to County Wicklow, which would have isolated us and caused tremendous difficulties.  If the Minister of State wants to promote buses and bikes, he should look at the record.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>If we were simply using our position in Opposition to oppose, it would do a great disservice to what Deputy Coveney has done, and we would not see such a well crafted motion before us.  It is a classic example of the dog in the manger, that the Ministers cannot accept this motion deals with a serious problem.  It is about security of supplies and the difficulties we need to address.  They have been overshadowed in particular by the banking crisis, which has been caused largely by the Greens&rsquo; Government partners.  That crisis has overshadowed everything and meanwhile there are issues such as peak oil and the uncertainty of energy supplies which need to be addressed.  Nothing the Minister has said contradicts what is in the Fine Gael motion.  That is why I have difficulty in understanding how small the Ministers&rsquo; minds are that they cannot accept this motion.  The strength of having a motion accepted across the House is not that the Opposition wins or scores a point; it is in showing that there is cross-party unanimity on a key issue that we face and which is not in the public consciousness.  The public are mystified by its effects.  For example, people are mystified why the price of petrol has gone so high, while the price of crude oil has not.  It is about currency fluctuations and taxes, but it underlines the point that this is a very volatile market.  We are at one in that we must find ways to deal with essential supplies, as well as ways to generate and use energy.</P>
        <P>One of the really good things that came out of the Green Party&rsquo;s contribution was the establishment of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  We all worked very well on that and will continue to do so, although it is a pity Deputy Cuffe is not there with us.  That is the kind of thinking we must adopt if we are to meet the challenges ahead.  It disturbs me that the old ways are now being adopted by the Green Party at a time when it argues, as we do, that we need to have new ways of dealing with this matter.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that this motion has not been accepted.  It is not controversial but it is challenging in a good sense.  It is not party political but it makes the point that this is a political issue.  I am genuinely befuddled as to why it has not been accepted.  We are all conscious of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil, which stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">There is an emerging consensus that without structural changes in the oil supply market, oil price volatility and the consequent economic volatility will be the dominant feature of the foreseeable future.  The targets for renewable energy, while visionary and to be welcomed, are not ambitious enough.  A wartime response is required to head off this issue before 2020.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">That is a stark statement from a body that is not particularly inclined towards sensationalism.  The issues include protection of supplies, the shift from fossil fuels, and ways of conserving and reducing our energy usage.  Much of it comes down to energy legislation, and I welcome the fact that the Minister mentioned that.  I appreciate there are demands on a small Department but he has indicated there will be legislation and I look forward to that.  I hope he can introduce it, but legislation on geothermal power has been already promised.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, gets home soon, wherever he is.  He indicated that we could expect to see that legislation by February.  We need to move on that.  We are talking about self-reliance and self-sufficiency to a much greater degree than this 95% dependance on fossil fuels.  We need to concentrate on achievable goals.</P>
        <P>I was dismayed to discover when I opened the legislative programme that, according to the Government, there is no publication date for the climate change Bill.  That is at variance with the trend that began when the joint Oireachtas committee produced a report on climate change legislation.  I was the rapporteur for that report, which contained an explanatory memorandum and was well received.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, produced his own framework document, which was far less ambitious but at least it was an attempt.  He presented it before we all went <Col N="469"/>to Copenhagen.  As I recall it, the approximate date for a debate on the final Bill was in June.  I suggest to the Minister and Minister of State that the Government has some difficulty in this regard and will leave it on the long finger.  Therefore, in the interest of the people who voted &ldquo;green&rdquo; at the last election, if I get the agreement of the Joint Committee on Climate Change to produce a Bill, will they give it a better hearing and more open attitude than they have given Deputy Coveney on his Private Members&rsquo; motion tonight?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McManus and the Labour Party for allowing me ten minutes to speak.  I support the general thrust of the motion, but have tabled an amendment regarding a crucial area that must be addressed if this country is to benefit to the maximum extent from any oil and gas that comes on stream in the future.  Irrespective of what side of the House we are on, we are all conscious of how vulnerable we are for energy security and of how we are hostage to energy costs.  We have seen this in the past, particularly in my part of the country where hundreds of jobs have been lost in the Tralee area due to energy costs.</P>
        <P>My amendment introduces changes in the revenue system that applies to oil and gas companies in order to bring them into line with what pertains in other countries.  I am aware the Minister has introduced some changes and commend him on these and am also conscious he inherited bad decisions of the past.  However, I do not believe the level of change is adequate and the changes only apply to new rather than existing projects such as the Corrib project.</P>
        <P>Norway is an example often cited with regard to the proper taxation and supervision of energy exploration.  The role that state has played in the development of its natural resources and in accruing revenue through taxation and royalties has laid the basis for a strong economy outside of the European Union.  It will be argued that Norway&rsquo;s offshore exploration sector has been well developed over more than 30 years, but the fact is that its system was in place from the beginning, and contrary to what some people here say, its tax regime and state oversight did not frighten away foreign companies.  That fear was the excuse given here for the decisions to change the tax and royalties regime.  I remember when the Minister was on this side of the House raising these issues and being told by the then Government we could not do as Norway had done because it would frighten off exploration.  However, that has not been the international experience even in countries where multinationals have exerted considerable influence over the local governments.  Obviously, a certain influence has been exerted here, given the ridiculously easy terms which have been handed to companies like Shell and others.  Neither did the companies involved in exploration in Norway refuse to enter into partnership with the Norwegian State exploration company.  It is ironic that because of the involvement of the Norwegian State company Statoil in the Corrib project, when that comes on stream, the Norwegians will benefit more than the people of this State.</P>
        <P>The recent announcement that a substantial deposit of oil has been located in the Irish Sea, off Dalkey, underlines both the potential that exists and the need to change the regime pertaining to oil and gas exploration.  The deposit there is estimated to be 860 million barrels, which at current prices would have a market value of &euro;60 billion.  On the issue of exploration, I worked on the Porcupine Basin for Phillip&rsquo;s Exploration 32 years ago.  While I was there a number of finds were made at a depth of 1,600 feet, which at the time made the finds unviable and almost impossible to bring to the surface and to shore.  I understand that technology has advanced so much now it would be capable of doing that.  The resources are there.  Am I correct that the changes the Minister made with regard to revenue will be retrospective in the case of any oil brought to the surface from the Porcupine Basin?  We were led to believe at the time <Col N="470"/>that there were substantial quantities of oil in the two finds made, but the wells were just capped and left.</P>
        <P>The potential benefits from the Dalkey oil coming on stream, both in terms of meeting future requirements and revenue, do not need to be underlined, particularly at a time when ordinary people are paying a huge price through being forced to shoulder the burden of meeting the financial shortfall brought about by the economic downturn and compounded by the Government&rsquo;s bailing out of the banks and failed property speculators.  This motion partly recognises the need for the State to take a closer hands-on approach in its reference to the National Oil Reserves Agency.  However, the logic of that is that if the State is involved in the development of gas revenue reserves, it should also have a direct stake in the area.  That has been the experience of all other developed countries, where the state, whatever its ideological complexion, recognises that exploration of expendable natural resources such as oil and gas are of a different character to multinational involvement in other parts of the economy.  Finds should be regarded in some way as part of the agricultural land and fishery waters of this country, although the manner in which our fisheries have been handed over to external control would not be a good example to follow.  There would be no question of the developed sovereign State allowing its agricultural land and food production be handed over totally to foreign companies.  The same should apply to managing our natural resources.</P>
        <P>The motion puts forward some good points with regard to future energy requirements and the need to ensure the country has a secure supply of the necessary fuel.  A huge step could be taken in that direction when the oil and gas off our coast come on stream.  However, the current situation does not guarantee this.  If, for example, the Corrib field was to begin production, there is no strategy to ensure the gas is used to supply our needs or to ensure it is distributed and priced properly to ensure economic benefits here rather than allow distribution and price be dictated by the market and the companies involved, which will wish to sell their gas to the most attractive market.  In light of the current revenue structures, the directing of the gas to overseas markets would constitute a double negative.</P>
        <P>The motion also refers to renewable energy and the development of biomass as an alternative means of meeting future requirements and lessening our massive dependence on fossil fuels, which comprise 96% of our energy mix.  When in Opposition, the Green Party used to highlight these issues as primary concerns, but in Government it has failed to create the pace of development it promised.  Alternative energy sources are being developed, but not on the scale required to meet the targets set.  Apart from biomass, there is massive potential in wind and tidal energy.  Far more could be done in these areas to develop these sources, particularly along the western coast.  Some excellent and ambitious projects are under way, but far more must be done if the potential is to be realised.  I refer in particular to the Shannon.  I have spoken in the past with regard to the use of reversible turbines in places with an eight knot tide, which offers huge potential.  From Helvick Head in the south east to beyond Youghal there is also a strong tide that offers huge potential.  I know some exploration work is being done in this regard.  It is a way to develop clean energy for the future.</P>
        <P>There have also been some interesting proposals, including from farmers&rsquo; groups, on micro generation.  There is potential, but the proper structures and incentives must be put in place.  On one level, such projects only represent a drop in the ocean, but if there are sufficient numbers of such projects and they take off, the country would have the potential to meet a small but significant part of overall energy needs.  These projects would also represent an <Col N="471"/>environmental plus and provide a boost to the economy on a local level, both in terms of construction and where the energy created aids the development of local enterprises.</P>
        <P>Planning is an issue which has raised some disquiet with regard to wind farms and there have been complaints that these are an eyesore.  Much of these concerns could be addressed if the proper structures and guidelines were in place and if local communities were kept aware and fully informed of plans and provided with accurate information regarding these structures.  It is essential that such communication with local communities exists to ensure the planning process can be delivered in a speedy way to the benefit of communities.</P>
        <P>It should also be ensured that certain areas are not overburdened with wind farms just because they are believed to be particularly suitable due to their geographical location and incidence of regular wind speeds sufficient to ensure high levels of production.  It has also been suggested that local produce could be encouraged at community co-operatives rather than being left to the initiative of private companies.  Again, this would not only help to address the problem of meeting energy requirements but would also contribute to local economic development.</P>
        <P>I support the overall intention of the motion and reject the claims made in the Government&rsquo;s amendment that all of the issues referred to are being adequately addressed.  Clearly they are not and, as I stated in my amendment, there is the broader issue of the structure imposed on revenue that needs to be addressed and which a future Government needs to do if the full potential of our national mineral resources are to be realised to the benefit of the Irish people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to see the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the House.  The situation with regard to head shops has been deteriorating for a period of time.  At least eight head shops have been attacked, largely through arson, with some fire-bombed.  Many of them were severely damaged.  In my constituency two were attacked with one totally demolished.  The absence of any meaningful action from the Government allows sinister elements to have full reign and operate what is effectively criminal behaviour.  Such absence also means that head shops can proliferate and spread throughout the country.  It is a lucrative trade as we have seen.  While that continues we will have more head shops throughout the country.  There are approximately 14 or 15 in my constituency and I understand there are approximately 100 throughout the country.</P>
        <P>At present, in Dublin Central many parents are in fear for their children.  Many of those accessing head shops are very young teenagers because there is no regulation or licensing or no restrictions on minors entering those shops and buying any of the products on sale.  Many of those products are labelled in one way but intended in another.  These products mimic the most dangerous of drugs which are illegal under the Misuse of Drugs Act, particularly cocaine and heroin.  They are sold as bath salts or plant food but in fact many of them are intended to be injected or ingested.  The danger that many parents in the north inner city fear with regard to their teenage sons and daughters is another drug epidemic to rival the heroin and cocaine epidemics of the 1980s and 1990s, because they are the drugs being mimicked in the head shops <Col N="472"/>which young people consume orally and inject.  At a recent meeting of the north inner city drugs task force the Garda indicated anecdotally that it had experienced a sharp rise in burglaries and larceny.</P>
        <P>Last Friday, the Minister stated he would introduce legislation to provide the Garda with new powers to deal with head shops.  Will he outline those proposals?  To date, the interdepartmental committee, on which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform sits, has not produced any tangible proposals or measures other than a statement of intent that some time towards the end of June certain named products will be banned and that this will come from the Department of Health and Children through the Irish Medicines Board.  As was indicated by many people commenting on the area, these are synthetic drugs and once the Minister announces, months in advance, what he intends to do those supplying the drugs will be able to mix the ingredients to produce similar drugs that will not be properly defined under the new designations under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  They will then proceed merrily on their way.</P>
        <P>Last month, the Labour Party proposed the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2010 which would prevent the proliferation of new head shops and would require existing head shops to obtain planning permission, which would be very difficult for them to do.  One simple Bill already on the Order Paper of the D&aacute;il could solve the problem almost overnight if the Government was prepared to accept it and process it through the D&aacute;il.  It could be done very quickly, in the space of a couple of days.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister outline his proposals on the new powers he intends to give to the Garda?  How are they expected to operate?  Will he take the Bill that is before the House and process and implement it and deal with the matter as quickly as possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  If it were easy it would have been solved much earlier than this.  The Government is taking action to deal with the problem of head shops.  In addition to the public health concerns I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, am acutely aware of the need for a criminal justice response.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to bring forward urgent legislation that would make it a criminal offence generally to supply unregulated psychotropic substances for use by humans.  I have taken this move following intensive discussions with both the Attorney General and the Garda Commissioner.  My goal is to bring the full force of the criminal justice system to bear down on head shops.  In my view,  they are gateways to illicit drug dependence and must be shut down.</P>
        <P>This effort is part of a multi-pronged approach to deal with the issue.  Already, the Minister for Health and Children has introduced regulations under the Misuse of Drugs Act to place controls on the specific substances currently available for sale in head shops.  That will deal with the immediate problem.  However, suppliers continuously develop new drugs and there is always a time-lag before such new drugs are subject to proper controls.  My legislative proposals are intended to be available to deal with new drugs as they emerge.</P>
        <P>As part of the multi-pronged approach, relevant Government agencies, including environmental health officers, are reviewing existing legislative provisions to establish if head shops are liable for prosecution under a range of legislation.  The primary vehicle for regulating psychotropic substances is the Misuse of Drugs Act.  As I stated, the Minister for Health and Children will take action under that Act to place controls on a range of substances currently on sale in head shops.  This will make the unauthorised possession and sale of these substances illegal and <Col N="473"/>subject to criminal sanctions.  The orders will effectively mean that the mainstream of substances being sold in these shops at the moment will be banned.</P>
        <P>The draft regulations have been notified to the European Commission as required by European law in order to allow these orders to come into effect as soon as possible.  It is not possible to take prosecutions until that period has elapsed.  Head shops are a problem in many jurisdictions where the authorities experience difficulties in finding comprehensive solutions.  A major problem associated with the control of head shops is that the legislators are often left to play catch up &mdash; as soon as one dangerous substance is banned in a country, another product is produced to take its place.  These products are often produced for an international market and incredible chemical expertise arid ingenuity is at play in constantly devising new products.  For that reason, I am exploring how best to provide a criminal justice legislative response.  While the full details of the legislation have yet to be finalised, the focus will be on seeking to ensure that the sale or supply of substances which may not be specifically proscribed under the Misuse of Drugs Act, but which have psychotropic effects, will be a criminal offence.  I am also examining how appropriate powers could be given to the Garda and to the courts to intervene quickly to prevent these outlets from selling these products by way of appropriate prohibition orders.  There are complicated drafting issues to be resolved but my officials have already been in contact with both the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Health and Children on the matter.  I expect to be in a position to bring forward proposals to the Government in the very near future.</P>
        <P>In the meantime a number of measures are already in train.  The activities of head shops are being closely monitored on an ongoing basis by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue&rsquo;s customs service, with a view to ensuring that no substances that are currently illegal are being sold.  The HSE, in association with partner agencies under the drugs strategy, is finalising a national drugs awareness campaign that will focus on the dangers of psychotropic substances available through head shops.  The national advisory committee on drugs has been asked to carry out some targeted research in this area.  The House can be assured that I as Minister, together with my ministerial colleagues, are pursuing all viable approaches to ending the problems posed by head shops.</P>

      <sTitle>Flood Relief.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important item tonight.  I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, is present because he represents much of the area that has been flooded in County Galway in the past.</P>
        <P>Just because we no longer see headlines about flooding in County Galway it does not mean it has gone away.  Flooding still exists in many parts of County Galway some three or four months later.  I welcome the list of small schemes proposed in County Galway in conjunction with Galway County Council and the OPW.  I pay tribute to the OPW personnel who have adopted a very sensible attitude and consultative role in progressing many of these schemes.  The schemes are now sensibly recognised as flood relief and not drainage.  Many of the small schemes announced are related to the Dunkellin catchment area.  The proposal means that the obstacles that caused much of the problem in the catchment area in the past can readily be removed, which would eliminate many, if not all, the problems that have caused such devastation to the family homes and farm lands in the areas concerned in County Galway.  Rock removal and bridge reconstruction will allow relief of many of the problems.</P>
        <P>South County Galway has a different problem.  The 1997 Peach report recommended that the Tarmon area alone was the one most suitable to be addressed.  I am asking the Minister to <Col N="474"/>revisit the issue and investigate the possibility of having minor works carried out there to alleviate some of the problem.  This was the single area in which work was recommended to proceed then on the basis of the cost-benefit analysis.  Unfortunately the funding provided on that occasion was returned to the Exchequer and no works were carried out.  I want a simple answer on this one.  All that is required in this area is to relieve the surplus water and not drainage.  The area in south County Galway should be re-examined to ascertain what can be done at low cost.  Local experience has shown that a simple channel or piped length of watercourse would eliminate the constant threat under which these people live from the periodic surplus waters during flood time.</P>
        <P>What will the Department do to provide for many farmers whose land was flooded in the November floods and still remains flooded?  These farmers have found that their lands are totally useless and have not yet had the spring growth.  Many farmers had reseeded the lands destroyed by the earlier floods about five weeks ago and had it all washed away by the most recent downpours.  This means that they will lose this year&rsquo;s fodder harvest.  I ask the Minister to examine the serious situation faced by many of these farmers who have lost out for a second time and will have serious problems later in the year.</P>
        <P>It is now suggested that part of the cause of the constant flooding in this area of south County Galway is the Coillte drainage system in the Slieve Aughty mountains which allows the rain to come down to the lowlands in torrents like never before through its vertical drainage system.  The Government should investigate in consultation with Coillte alternative contour patterns of drainage rather than the vertical system which now exists causing the problems.  At present these forests are being felled and cleared, which allows an ideal opportunity for the OPW to investigate without additional cost.</P>
        <P>The remit of the HSE to administer humanitarian funds was to make dwellings safe and habitable.  How much has been paid out to these householders to do that?  Most of the houses flooded in County Galway, in Ballinasloe, in Meelick, Eyrecourt and along the Shannon banks can be made habitable but not safe as they will be flooded again unless the works are carried out.  Will the Government consider the relocation of some of these families in County Galway and the flood protections in Ballinasloe as well as the management of the water levels in the Shannon basin so that they will not suffer the inevitable floods if work is not carried out?  It would be much better if humanitarian funds were combined with insurance compensation, which would go a long way to provide a safe dwelling in an upland area.</P>
        <P>The people want to eliminate the serious problems for the future.  Given the number of agencies with an interest in the environment in the area, will the OPW under the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, take the lead role to convince these groups that people&rsquo;s livelihoods are more important than the flora and fauna?  When will the legislation giving this power to the Minister of State be before the D&aacute;il?</P>

	<P>There seem to be crossed wires between the Deputy and ourselves in that the subject matter of the Adjournment debate was &ldquo;the humanitarian support provided to date three months after the major flooding of 2009&rdquo;.  That was thought to refer to the humanitarian funds being administered by my Department.  I do not have any details on OPW works, because it was not considered to be what the Deputy was going to raise this evening.  However, I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, and ask him to come back to the Deputy directly.  I apologise, but <Col N="475"/>the way the matter was worded, it was thought to be similar to a motion raised on the Adjournment in the Seanad in the past few weeks by one of the Deputy&rsquo;s colleagues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I hope the Minister will clarify with the answer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>All I can talk about is the humanitarian aid.  If the Deputy is interested I can read that.</P>
        <P>The bulk of the overall cost of repairing the damage caused to individuals&rsquo; homes by last November&rsquo;s flooding is being met through insurance policies held by the people affected.  The insurance industry is currently in the course of discharging its financial obligations to its policyholders.  However, in recognition of the devastation suffered by people in many areas of the country as a result of these floods, the Government set up a humanitarian assistance scheme.  The scheme has two objectives.  First, it provided financial and other assistance, without an income test, in the immediate aftermath of the flooding.  Second, it provides income-tested financial support for the replacement of essential household items and home repairs in cases not covered by insurance.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s community welfare service has been providing support to households since this flooding occurred.  Up to 9 April 2010, it had made 2,809 payments to 1,259 individuals to the value of &euro;1,100,616 throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Out of &euro;10 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The &euro;10 million is there, if there is a legitimate case for it.</P>
        <P>The largest payment to an individual was in excess of &euro;20,000.  Most of these payments have been in respect of immediate needs, such as clothing, food, bedding and emergency accommodation.  The community welfare service will continue to make these payments as long as they are needed.  Such emergency payments under the humanitarian assistance scheme are made without delay and without regard to the household income, as the primary objective of that type of payment is to address the person&rsquo;s immediate needs.</P>
        <P>Payments have also been made in respect of essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods.  Payments in respect of longer-term needs, such as meeting the cost of repairing homes and making them habitable again, take somewhat longer as homeowners must first establish the cost of repair, which explains the small amount of money paid out to date.  Homeowners and builders are not in a position to do this in the immediate aftermath of a flood for practical reasons and, consequently, relatively few large-scale claims have been made at this stage.  However, with the passage of time, individuals are now in a better position to assess the extent of the damage to their homes and, consequently, it is expected that more large-scale claims will be received over the coming weeks.  As homeowners establish the cost of repair by securing builders&rsquo; estimates, the extent of the loss is verified, usually by a loss assessor in cases where significant amounts are claimed, and details of the amounts that can be provided under the humanitarian assistance scheme are then sent to the homeowners in question.</P>
        <P>While the timescale for determining applications for humanitarian assistance claims is dependant, among other things, on the availability of the required information, there is no <Col N="476"/>backlog of undecided claims.  According to the information available from the HSE, there are fewer than 50 applications currently being assessed and only four claims refused, none of which was because of household income.</P>
        <P>The level of payment available under the aid scheme to any qualified individual depends on the severity of the damage to that person&rsquo;s home and the extent of the loss experienced, as well as household income and general family circumstances.  The scheme provides hardship alleviation as opposed to full compensation.  As on previous occasions, commercial or business losses are not covered by the scheme, nor are losses which are covered by household insurance.  Applications under the scheme are being income tested to ensure that available assistance is prioritised for those who are most vulnerable.  The basic objective of the income test is to determine the household&rsquo;s capacity to meet the costs of restoring the home to a habitable condition, with an underlying principle that individuals and families with average levels of income will qualify for assistance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to discuss this very important matter, namely, the urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide the essential funding for Melview national school, Melview, County Longford, which has been sought since the mid-1980s.  Despite an unacceptable deterioration in the built environment, this school has not received permission to proceed with essential works which are necessary as a health and safety measure and to accommodate pupil numbers.</P>
        <P>As I noted, this school has been seeking sanction for improvements since the mid-1980s.  Despite permission for similar works being granted to other schools in the area, Melview has failed to receive a similar go ahead.  This issue of the inadequacy of the built environment at Melview is one of space and, most importantly, of health and safety.  The non-provision of necessary additional classroom space is leading to an ongoing health hazard.</P>
        <P>Three of the existing classrooms do not conform to the recommended size and this results in pupils being accommodated in an unhygienic atmosphere.  Two of these rooms were never intended or suitable for classrooms but shortage of space means that they have been pressed into service.  The general purpose room has been divided into two even smaller classrooms.  Costly prefab accommodation and three resource rooms are leaking and unhygienic, with sub-standard toilet and washing facilities for the children.  The board of management has received <Col N="477"/>a letter outlining the unsuitability and health risks associated with this prefab.  Since January of this year, burst pipes mean the prefab can no longer be used as a classroom.  In addition, in what is a major outrage, a class of 26 eight and nine year olds is being accommodated in a staffroom cum kitchen which measures 9 m by 4 m.</P>
        <P>As if this were not bad enough, the resource teacher also has to share this limited space.  Pupils in this room have to use adult toilet facilities which do not meet the required standards for children of this age.  How can the Minister expect children to be safe in these cramped, unhygienic and inadequate-for-purpose conditions?  In fact, there are only three toilets in the school for 60 pupils.</P>
        <P>As I told the previous Minister on a number of occasions, if children who are forced to receive an education in totally inadequate accommodation due to lack of Government funding should have an accident, the buck stops with the Minister, who is responsible for the safety of children under the care of her Department.</P>
        <P>Given that the general purpose room is being utilised as two classrooms, the pupils of Melview have no proper play time or exercise during the major part of the school year.  The PE curriculum is curtailed and extra-curricular activities such as a Christmas play and other drama productions are non-existent.  Car and bus parking to the front of the school is little more than a standard hard shoulder and is extremely dangerous for pupils being dropped off at or collected from the school.  Will it take and accident or even a fatality at this school for the Minister to provide the improvements needed to make Melview a safe and student-friendly environment for the pupils?</P>
        <P>The very hard working principal and staff have contacted me on several occasions with regard to the conditions.  Parents of children at this school need the reassurance of knowing that funding will be made available and that their children will be safe.  I plead with the Minister to provide funding for the safety of the children at this school.  It is critical she responds to this Adjournment matter in the interests of public safety.  If an accident happens at this school, I will hold the Government and the Minister accountable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Coughlan.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity of outlining to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and, in particular, the Department&rsquo;s position regarding the upgrading of facilities in Melview national school, County Longford.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our existing building stock, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  The 2010 capital allocation for the primary and post primary sectors is &euro;579 million and this sum will facilitate the delivery of the school building programme through a range of projects and schemes.</P>
        <P>On 16 February, the then Minister announced the 2010 large scale school building programme.  Some 52 school projects &mdash; 37 primary and 15 post primary &mdash; are to advance to tender and construction later this year and in 2011.  Some 51 school building projects &mdash; 44 primary and seven post primary &mdash; are expected to appoint design teams this year.  Approval was given for seven new primary schools to open in September in rapidly developing areas.  Arising from earlier school building programme announcements, 30 large-scale projects, 23 primary and seven post-primary, are under construction at present.   A further 27 large-scale projects, 19 <Col N="478"/>primary and eight post-primary, are due to commence construction during the first half of the year, with a further 14 projects, 10 primary and four post-primary, due to go on site as soon as possible.  Payments will issue on fees for other projects already in architectural planning.</P>
     
        <P>Depending on the rate of progress of the various projects in the programme, adjustments may be made throughout 2010.  These adjustments may arise in the context of the ongoing monitoring of the programme undertaken by the Department in the normal course of events.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As the Deputy may be aware, the T&aacute;naiste yesterday announced the successful applicants for the 2010 summer works scheme.  A total of &euro;122 million will see major improvements works carried out in 1,490 primary and post-primary schools across the country.  The summer works scheme covers projects in school buildings such as gas, electrical and mechanical works, roof replacements and repairs, window replacement, toilet upgrades, structural improvements and access works.  This record level of investment through the summer works scheme has the potential to generate work for more than 4,400 construction workers across the country during the summer period.  The projects approved under the summer works scheme had been assessed as being priority projects by the individual schools themselves and the capacity of schools to take responsibility for delivering small and medium-scale projects is a key component of the summer works scheme.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.3- ?>
        <P>Major capital projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  A proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision of desirable, but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities, such as a library or new sports hall.</P>
        <P>In July 2008, the Department introduced a new devolved scheme which allows those schools to avail of the option of using approved funding for the provision of additional accommodation to either purchase prefabs or to construct permanent classrooms for the same amount.  The Department has also introduced a new scheme aimed at replacing rented prefabs with permanent modular buildings.  This project will be targeted at schools that have older rented prefabs and need long-term additional accommodation.</P>
        <P>In 2008 Melview national school received grant aid in excess of &euro;127,000 to fund electrical and sewerage improvements works at the school.  The school also received a grant of &euro;12,500 under the 2005 summer works scheme for roof repairs.  The management authority of this school applied for additional accommodation in January 2010 under the Department&rsquo;s additional accommodation scheme.  The school had an enrolment of 216 pupils at September 2009 and a staffing of principal, eight assistant teachers, two learning support teachers and two resource teachers for Travellers.</P>
        <P>Following an assessment of the application, the school was informed in March 2010 that a grant of &euro;200,000 has been sanctioned for the provision of an extension consisting of two mainstream classrooms.  The school also sought approval for funding toward the provision of additional resources rooms and the Department will be in contact with the school authority shortly regarding this request.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position for Melview national school, County Longford.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue.  I was recently asked to meet the chairpersons and principals of the two national schools in Togher, which are sited on the one campus on the south western side of the city, in an area that was designated as disadvantaged and has many social problems, which manifest themselves in the school population.</P>
        <P>Recent changes to RAPID areas have left the schools just outside such an area, and they have lost RAPID status and DEIS status, a double blow.  The girls&rsquo; school, which has an enrolment of 280 children, has lost four teaching posts.  It has ten class teachers, losing two concessionary posts it has had since 1986, a home-school liaison post and a language teacher post.  A special duties post has been also lost.  This has had an enormous effect on pupils and teachers.  Will the Minister outline the thinking behind the reduction in these posts for this school?</P>
        <P>The area has a lot of social housing and rental accommodation, which attracts a high proportion of non-nationals.  This is reflected in the populations of both schools, where almost 30% of students are from a non-English speaking background.  The girls&rsquo; school, however, has only two language support teachers for almost 90 children.  Integrating those children who do not speak English into the school population is an impossible task that causes stress for teachers, who are in some cases dealing with class sizes of between 23 and 35.  Without the necessary language supports those classes will suffer.</P>
        <P>There is no home-school liaison teacher to provide assistance, which has a knock-on effect on parents, who do not get the help and support they need at home.  The teachers, principal, chairpersons and board of management are concerned about the impact this will have on the community.  We all know the value to a community of a school that is well integrated into that community.</P>
        <P>The impact of these cuts on the schools, with four teaching posts being lost in a school that now has ten teachers, is significant.  It has a traumatic effect on the school.  There will not be a review of DEIS until 2012 and with a growing population and the demographic change, some support must be introduced.  The school and the children in it are suffering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue today and I am pleased to be able to outline the general position regarding staffing at primary level.  The staffing schedule impacts on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining.  In terms of the position at individual school level, the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by the Department is the pupil enrolment.</P>
        <P>While the staffing schedule at primary level allocates on the basis of an average number of pupils, each individual school decides on how to arrange its classes. Combined classes are a feature of the majority of primary schools in the country and this arrangement has no adverse implications for the quality of the education children receive.  From an educational perspective it is important to note that numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that teacher quality is the single most important factor &mdash; far and above anything else &mdash; in improving educational outcomes for children.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the renewed programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government.  It also states that 500 teaching posts will be provided between primary and second levels over the next three years.</P>
        <P>A hundred of these posts have been allocated to each sector, primary and post-primary, in the current school year.  At primary level the posts have been allocated to schools that had <Col N="480"/>increased enrolments in the current school year and which, as a result of last year&rsquo;s pupil-teacher ratio change, lost out on a teaching post in this year by either one, two or three pupils.  For the coming school year the additional posts have also enabled some improvement to be made to the staffing schedule at primary level, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  These improvements are targeted at medium to larger schools which are typically under the greatest pressure in regard to class sizes.</P>
        <P>The level of teaching resources allocated to individual schools for special needs and language support will be determined following completion of the allocation processes for these posts during the spring and summer periods.  It is only when all the various allocation processes, including the appeals mechanisms, are fully completed that the final staffing position for individual schools will be fully determined.</P>
        <P>It is important for all schools to ensure that whatever teaching resources the Government can afford in these unprecedented economic times are used to maximum effect to achieve the best possible outcomes for children.  Again, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>

	<P>The Social Insurance Fund operates under the terms of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005.  The Fund comprises a current account and an investment account.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs manages and controls the current account from which benefit payments are made, while the Minister for Finance, through the National Treasury Management Agency, manages the investment account. To the extent that annual income is not required for benefit payments, this finance, together with the accumulated surplus from previous years, is transferred to the investment account.  </P>
        <P>Between 1999 and 2007, the fund had a surplus each year, ranging from &euro;256m in 2003 to &euro;649m in 2006.  The accumulated surplus rose from &euro;420m in 1999 to &euro;3,632 in 2007.  Deficits were recorded in 2008 and 2009, reducing the accumulated surplus to &euro;934m at the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>In 2010 the Fund will exhaust the cash balance held in the investment account.  The operating deficit of the Fund at the end of 2010 is estimated to be &euro;1.55 billion, which will be borne by the Exchequer by means of a subvention from the Oireachtas &mdash; Vote 38.</P>
        <P>It is forecast that the Social Insurance Fund expenditure will exceed its income in each of the years 2011 to 2013, with the deficit continuing to be borne by means of a subvention from the Exchequer.  The Social Insurance Fund will continue to hold a capital asset over this period represented in the form of Department&rsquo;s headquarters property in Store Street, Dublin.</P><Col N="482"/>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 77, 78, 90, 99 and 101 together.</P><Col N="483"/>
        <P>The national average processing times for jobseeker claims decided during March were 2.12 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and 7.10 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  These figures are a slight improvement on February 2010 when they stood at 2.32 weeks and 7.67 weeks respectively.</P>
        <P>I set out below a table showing the processing times at each local office during March.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The total number of jobseekers awaiting a decision on their claim at 10 April 2010 was 52,815. This is a reduction of over 7,000 compared with the figures three months earlier on 9 January 2010 and represents 10% of the total jobseeker claim load nationwide.</P>
        <P>I understand that even when the Live Register was at its lowest, there would always be about 10 per cent of claims awaiting a decision.  The current performance should be seen in the context that in 2009 alone, local offices received over 670,000 jobseeker claims.</P>
        <P>I also set out below a table showing the breakdown of jobseekers benefit (JB) and jobseekers allowance (JA) claims awaiting a decision at each local office. This data has been compiled from data that is maintained on a local office catchment area basis and these figures do not correspond exactly with county boundaries.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware of the particular difficulties presented due to the huge rise in unemployment in the past 18 months or so and the pressure this has brought to bear on the network of local and branch offices and in the inspectorate.</P>
        <P>To alleviate some of this pressure since May 2008, some 450 extra staff have been assigned to local offices, new Central Support Units and the Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate.  At the same time the Department has been examining procedures and processes surrounding the claim acceptance and decisions process with a view to streamlining them and achieving greater efficiencies where possible.   The initiatives introduced include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />an appointment system whereby claimants can have their claim taken and decided during the appointment.  This particular initiative has helped greatly in reducing waiting times.  We have this system in operation in 38 local offices and plan to extend it to further offices,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseekers allowance when their jobseekers benefit expires,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous two years,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />application forms for the jobseeker schemes are now available on the Department&rsquo;s website which means that anyone who wants to make a claim can print the form at home and bring it to the local office completed, thereby reducing queuing times,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />more straight-forward procedures for providing evidence of identity and address have been introduced, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />simplified processing methods for some claimants who work casually, part-time or are classed as Systematic Short-Time workers.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I appreciate the importance of getting claims decided as quickly as possible and I want to assure the House that staff in local offices and in the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate are doing all they can to ensure that claims are processed as quickly as possible.</P><Col N="484"/>

	<P>Facilitators work closely with F&Aacute;S and other agencies, at national and local level, to identify appropriate training and developmental programmes for social welfare recipients of working age to enhance the skills those individuals have and, ultimately, improve their employment chances as well as helping them to develop personally. </P>
        <P>The facilitator service is available to social welfare recipients at all local offices where facilitators hold open clinics and meet with people who have been referred either by the social welfare local office or by other agencies. Arrangements to see the facilitator can be made by contacting the social welfare local office or the facilitator directly. In addition, cases are selected and referred to facilitators by Employment Support section.</P>
        <P>There are currently 62 facilitators in place (a full-time equivalent of 60.4 posts). It is intended to increase this to 70 posts.</P>
        <P>In the current economic climate the demand for the facilitator service is elevated. Facilitators generally have scheduled days when they are available in different locations across our network of offices and people wishing to meet with a Facilitator would be advised to call on one of those days &mdash; a centralised appointment system is not maintained. Accordingly waiting times for individual facilitators are not maintained. Facilitators make every effort to contact all interested customers as quickly as possible.</P>

        <Quest> the details of the Public Service Card with photo identification to be rolled out from 2010. </Quest>
        <QRef>[15446/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department has developed, in conjunction with a number of other Government Departments, the specifications for a Public Service Card (PSC) under the Standard Authentication Framework Environment, or SAFE, programme.  The specification provides for identification features, including a photograph.  The aim is to develop a card that acts as a key for access to public services in general, identifying and authenticating individuals as appropriate and where required.</P>
        <P>Legislative provisions in relation to the introduction of the Public Service Card have been included in Section 263 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended by Section 32 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007).</P>
        <P>These specify that the Minister may issue a Public Service Card in the format that he or she deems fit with the person&rsquo;s name, personal public service number, photograph, signature, card issue number and card expiry date to be inscribed on the card.  Provision is also included for the person&rsquo;s name, personal public service number, date of birth, sex, all former surnames (if any) of the person&rsquo;s mother, photograph, signature and card expiry date to be electronically encoded on the card.  In addition, provision is made for any other information that may be prescribed to be either inscribed or electronically encoded on the card.</P>
        <P>Over the past few years significant progress has been made on the implementation of the project including the selection of a preferred bidder to provide a managed service for card production and related bureau services.  Technical specifications were finalised and the necessary organisational change was designed.</P>
        <P>However, in view of the prevailing economic climate the project was suspended until formal sanction to proceed was received from the Department of Finance at the end of last year. A contract was agreed with the managed service provider from early January.</P>
        <P>The remaining elements of the project are expected to take several months to complete.  Significant preparatory work has to be undertaken including decisions regarding the final design of the card and to develop a secure site for the personalisation of the cards. It will also be necessary to develop a technical infrastructure within the Department to support the management and administration of the cards.  Procurement for this development has commenced.  It is anticipated that cards will begin to issue in the last quarter of this year.</P>
        <P>The overall time for completion of initial deployment of a Public Service Card is dependent on the rate at which it will be possible to register all of those to whom it will be issued.</P>
        <P>Features such as photographs and signatures and electronic card authentication are expected to minimise the rate of fraud and error arising from incorrectly identified and authenticated individuals.</P>
        <P>The Public Service Card will replace cards currently in use, such as the Social Services Card and the Free Travel card with highly secure cards.  Other Departments and agencies will also be in a position to use the card.</P>
        <P>A further benefit of the Public Service Card will be the efficiencies that can be achieved by all agencies using the card.  The time spent on establishing identity and authentication will be reduced leading to significant potential savings across the whole public sector.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 114 and 658 together.</P>
        <P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems. The role of money advisers is to help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors. MABS is now dealing with increasingly complex debt situations in respect of clients who are presenting with multiple creditors/debts.</P>
        <P>It is important that people coping with debt difficulties take early action and approach MABS for help and guidance. This can be the first positive step for people in addressing debt difficulties.</P>
        <P>There are 52 independent MABS companies operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country, with national support provided by the MABS NDL. In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9 am to 8 pm Monday to Friday and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at www.mabs.ie.</P>
        <P>In 2006, MABS dealt with 11,000 new clients. This increased to 12,000 and 16,000 in 2007 and 2008 respectively. The number increased further to 19,000 in 2009. Some 5,500 new clients have approached MABS this year which would indicate that the number of clients is broadly in line with the figures for 2009. In addition the MABS helpline has dealt some 45,000 calls since its launch in October 2007. Some 7,500 calls have been dealt with to date this year, compared with 24,000 callers in 2009.</P>
        <P>Last year an additional 19 money advisers were recruited by MABS between September and December, bringing the number of MABS staff to over 270. The additional advisors have been appointed to MABS companies throughout the country.</P>
        <P>From first point of contact to first appointment with a money adviser the average waiting time is currently approximately 4 weeks. This is the average nationally and there are fluctuations between offices. During the waiting period, clients are assessed and those in need of immediate assistance are given a priority appointment, others are provided with assisted self-help to ensure that they have taken steps to assess their situation and if appropriate they are supported to take holding action with their creditors.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the additional resources provided to MABS will assist them to meet the demand for their services.</P>

	<P>As Deputies will be aware, the Civil Partnership Bill is the primary responsibility of the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and is currently at Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  The implications of the Civil Partnership Bill for social welfare schemes are under consideration in my Department.</P>
        <P>Social welfare legislation defines a &lsquo;couple&rsquo; as meaning &lsquo;a married couple who are living together or a man and woman who are not married to each other but are cohabiting as husband and wife&rsquo;.  Furthermore, a reference to &lsquo;spouse&rsquo; in the definition of &lsquo;qualified adult&rsquo; includes &lsquo;a man and woman who are not married to each other but are cohabiting as husband and wife&rsquo;. When entitlement to social welfare benefits is determined, members of same sex couples are treated as individuals.</P>
        <P>The introduction of Civil Partnership will enable cohabiting same-sex couples to register their partnership.  It is intended that following the enactment of the Civil Partnership Bill, that these couples will be treated in the same way as spouses under the social welfare code.</P>
        <P>In these cases the claimant will be entitled to have his/her partner registered to receive a payment for a Qualified Adult.  The partner may also be entitled to receive survivor&rsquo;s benefits such as the widow/widowers pension.</P>
        <P>In the case of means-tested payments means assessments are carried out on a household basis with the means of a spouse being taken into account.  This will apply to same-sex couples following the introduction of the Civil Partnership Act.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the Civil Partnership Act will impact on a number of areas of the social welfare code.  Officials of the Department are examining the likely impact of the Act.  However, until the Civil Registration Act is enacted it is not possible to amend Social Welfare legislation.  However, legislative changes to the social welfare code will be provided for as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The money advisers throughout the country focus on providing assistance, advice and intense support to people who have financial difficulties. The money adviser works out a budget and negotiates on behalf of the client with all creditors, including financial institutions and sub-prime lenders, to secure better terms for the client in managing the repayment of their debts. Where required by the client, the money adviser can assist with setting up a special account with a local Credit Union into which an agreed amount of money is lodged regularly and from which each month the money adviser makes the repayments to the creditors on behalf of the client. In 2009 some 2,618 special accounts were set up with the local Credit Unions. </P><Col N="493"/>
        <P>Focused training programmes designed to equip money advice staff and local management boards to meet the demands on the services are provided by MABS NDL, the national support company. In addition, MABS NDL has introduced a number of community education and other initiatives to assist the services in managing their increased caseloads. These include a money management education programme for people facing redundancy to inform them about managing on a reduced income and how to avoid getting into debt.</P>
        <P>Under the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears published by the Financial Regulator, all financial institutions including the banks and sub-prime mortgage lenders must, where circumstances warrant it, refer a borrower in difficulty for guidance to a local MABS office or to an appropriate alternative.</P>
        <P>An operational protocol &lsquo;<i>Working Together to Manage Debt&rsquo;</i>  is in place and is the result of almost 2 years work by MABS NDL and the Irish Banking Federation (IBF), the main representative body for the banking and financial services sector. The protocol applies to all client debts, including mortgage debt owed to the major lending institutions in Ireland and includes a commitment that no legal action will be taken as long as there is compliance by the client with an agreed repayment plan.</P>
        <P>Last year an additional 19 money advisers were appointed to MABS companies throughout the country. They have been fully trained in the application of money advice work and the relevant codes and legislation relating to mortgage debt.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that MABS provides a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances. I am confident that the money advisers are trained and equipped to deliver this important service to the members of the public who require it.</P>

	<P>The Department, formerly provided pensions forecasts on request to PRSI contributors. The service was stopped for a number of reasons. For example, it is not possible at a given point in time to indicate with certainty what a person&rsquo;s future entitlements might be. Entitlements obviously will depend on the accuracy of their record to date, future employment patterns and contributions made to the social insurance system up until retirement. </P>
        <P>The Department provides a full history of individual social insurance contributions to customers on request along with the booklet &lsquo;Working It Out&rsquo;, to assist them in assessing their possible pension entitlement. This enables customers to review their contribution history. Should they identify any &lsquo;gaps&rsquo; in their record, they can have these investigated and rectified in advance of pension application stage.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the Department implemented an online facility via its website www.welfare.ie , to allow customers to request their contribution record. Whether requested online or through standard correspondence, the record is currently issued in hard copy. A further development of this facility, the provision of online access for customers to their PRSI contributions record, is included in the Department&rsquo;s modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>The Department is currently examining the technologies available to deliver this functionality in a safe and secure environment, and it is planned to implement this service in 2010. This new online service will allow customers to view their contribution records on-screen. It will enable <Col N="494"/>them to establish their entitlement to a contributory-based pension, such as State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Transition) or Widow(er)&rsquo;s Contributory Pension, using the guidelines and step-by-step calculator provided in the &lsquo;Working it Out booklets, taking into consideration the combination of their contribution record at that point and their own projected work pattern prior to reaching pension age.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department operates a network of approximately 130 local and branch offices throughout the country. Information Officers in these offices are available to explain supports and services to people. This locally based service is supported by a central Information Unit which operates a LoCall information line (1890 66 22 44) which customers may call for information and guidance on their entitlements.</P>
        <P>The Citizens Information Board, which comes under the aegis of the Department, is the national information agency with responsibility for supporting the provision of independent information and advice on the broad range of social services including social welfare services. Information is provided through Citizens Information Centres and other offices throughout the country, through a phone service (1890 777 121) which operates from 9 am to 9 pm Monday to Friday and on the website at www.citizensinformation.ie.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that these services provide the best approach to providing information to people to enable them to assess their likely pensions entitlements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government believes that the current arrangements, whereby a lone parent can receive the One-Parent Family Payment until their child is 18 or 22 if in full-time education, without any requirement for them to engage in employment, education or training, are not in the best interests of the recipient, their children or society.  </P>
        <P>Despite improvements made to the One-Parent Family Payment over the years, a large proportion of lone parents and their children are still experiencing poverty.</P>
        <P>In general, the best route out of poverty is through employment.  We recognise that work, and especially full-time work, may not be an option for parents of young children.  However, we believe that supporting parents to participate in the labour market, once their children have reached an appropriate age, will improve both their own economic situation and the social well-being of themselves and their families.</P>
        <P>The Department has undertaken a comprehensive review of the One-Parent Family Payment and developed proposals which are designed to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Prevent long-term dependence on welfare and facilitate financial independence;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Recognise parental choice with regard to care of young children but with the expectation that parents will not remain outside of the labour force indefinitely, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Include an expectation of participation in education, training and employment, with supports provided in this regard.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">To meet these social policy objectives, I will be introducing changes to the One-Parent Family payment in the forthcoming Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010. For new <Col N="495"/>customers, from early 2011, it is proposed that the One-Parent Family payment will be made until the youngest child in the lone parent family reaches age 13 years. For existing customers there will be a phasing out period to enable them to access education and training, to prepare them for their return to the labour market.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the reformed scheme there will be special provisions for families with children for whom Domicilary Care allowance is paid and for those who are recently bereaved (married and cohabiting) with children over the age of 13 years.</P>
        <P>This change will bring Ireland&rsquo;s support for lone parents more into line with international provisions, where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.  The EU countries achieving the best outcomes in terms of tackling child poverty are those that are combining strategies aimed at facilitating access to employment and enabling services (e.g. child care) with income support.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to employees on farms when refers to &ldquo;farm operators&rdquo;. If the Deputy was referring to self-employed farmers, the information he requires will be provided on request to my office. </P>
        <P>My Department currently operates a range of schemes for people with an illness or disability including the insurance based illness benefit and invalidity pension schemes, the occupational injury benefit scheme for those who are unable to work because of an accident or illness suffered at work and the means-tested disability allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>Farm operators normally pay Class A social insurance contributions and therefore, subject to satisfying the contribution and medical requirements, would be entitled to the full range of illness and disability payments. Should they suffer from a specified illness related to their employment or an accident while at work they can apply for injury benefit which would be paid for a period of 26 weeks.</P>
        <P>A person who acquires an illness or disability outside the work environment, or who is still unable to work after 26 weeks of receiving injury benefit, may qualify for illness benefit. They must meet certain medical and contribution requirements in order to receive this payment which can be paid for a maximum period of 104 weeks. In the event that the person concerned is permanently incapable of working, they may qualify for Invalidity pension, subject to satisfying the medical criteria and contribution conditions associated with that scheme. A person who does not satisfy the medical and contribution conditions for illness benefit or invalidity pension, and whose means are below a prescribed level, may qualify for disability allowance instead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 85 together. </P>
        <P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>There are currently almost 95,000 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment &mdash; an increase of over 57 per cent since the end of 2005. Over 37,800 have been in payment for 18 months or more.</P>
        <P>The rental accommodation scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Details of these cases are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities. Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, the RAS.</P>
        <P>Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government show that a total of 25,623 transfers from rent supplement to local authorities have occurred since 2005: 13,860 rent supplement cases to the RAS and a further 11,763 recipients to other social housing options.</P>
        <P>It is accepted that progress in relation to RAS was initially slower than expected. However the pace of delivery has improved significantly. In total, 14,000 recipients were transferred in 2008 and 2009, achieving targets set for RAS transfers for these years. The target established for 2010 is for a further 8,000 rent supplement tenants to be provided with a housing solution by local authorities.</P>
        <P>In consultation with this Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has approved a number of pilot programmes in different local authorities to increase the flow of transfers. These include allowing applicants for RAS to seek out their own properties which, subject to compliance with the normal conditions and the agreement of <Col N="498"/>the landlord, may then be taken into the leasing programme. Approved housing bodies under the leasing initiative have also been advised that they can seek applicants for social housing support directly from households in long term receipt of rent supplement as part of a of choice-based lettings approach to allocations.</P>
        <P>The Department continues to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and is represented on a number of RAS implementation groups. The purpose of these Groups is to ensure that the RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 80, 94, 102, 113 and 718 together.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is to provide short term support to people who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayments due to changes in their employment circumstances and whose means are now inadequate to meet their basic day to day needs. The scheme, working within the overall social welfare framework, aims to ensure that people do not suffer unnecessary hardship due to loss of employment and that, in the short term, they can retain their home whilst unemployed. Mortgage interest supplement is a means tested payment with other qualifying criteria applying and it only covers the mortgage interest payments in respect of an eligible person&rsquo;s home.</P><Col N="499"/>
        <P>There are currently just over 16,100 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, compared to 8,091 recipients in 2008, a doubling of the recipients in the last two years. Expenditure for the year ending December 2009 was &euro;60.7m; the estimate for 2010 is &euro;63.9m.</P>
        <P>Generally, all applications for mortgage interest supplement are recorded electronically. However, as this practice can vary across community welfare areas, full statistics for the number of people who applied for mortgage interest supplement are not available. Community welfare officers have been reminded to record the details of receipt and status of all claims electronically. However, requests to change operational procedures must be viewed in the context of the increased demands being placed on community welfare officers in the current economic environment.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the mortgage interest supplement review is to examine how the scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis. The review group includes representatives from my Department, the Community Welfare Service, the Departments of Finance and Environment, Heritage and Local Government, together with a representative from the Office of the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>As part of the initial review, guidelines on specific and immediate operational issues were drawn up and circulated to the community welfare officers. These guidelines are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.welfare.ie</P>
        <P>The group is examining trends in programme and administrative costs, the impact of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s statutory Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears and legislative and operational issues arising, including the cap on hours of employment.</P>
        <P>The review is also considering whether alternative approaches to achieving the scheme&rsquo;s objectives are warranted in the light of recent changes in the economic climate and the mortgage market. The conclusions and recommendations from the review, which are currently being finalised, will inform the work Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group.</P>
        <P>The Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group under the independent Chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney, comprises representatives from my own Department, the Departments of Finance, Taoiseach, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Social and Family Affairs. In addition the Group has representatives from the office of the Financial Regulator, the ESRI, the Irish Banking Federation, the Free Legal Advice Centre and the Law Reform Commission.</P>
        <P>The terms of Reference for the Group are based on the Renewed Programme for Government, with an emphasis on protecting the family home, and include further review of the existing statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears which include alternative repayment measures, the recently agreed protocol between the Irish Bankers Federation and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service on debt default with a view to expanding the options available for dealing with debt situations, including the use by banks and lenders of more flexible mechanisms to avoid foreclosure in appropriate circumstances. In addition, the Group will examine measures adopted in other jurisdictions and consider ways of expanding existing mortgage-support measures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 111 together.</P>
        <P>Article 8 of Directive 80/987/EEC provides that Member States shall ensure that the necessary measures are taken to protect the interests of employees and of persons having already left the employer&rsquo;s undertaking or business at the date of the onset of the employer&rsquo;s insolvency.</P>
        <P>Article 8 was implemented by section 7 of the Protection of Employees (Employer Insolvency) Act 1984. This provides that certain payments due to be paid by the employer in the last 12 months may be made from the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
        <P>In its 1995 review of the transposition of that Directive, the EU Commission gave an assurance that Ireland had adequately transposed the provision in that Directive.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission is currently conducting a further review of the implementation of Article 8 of the Directive throughout all member states. Once that review is completed, its recommendations will be considered by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Any actions necessary will be progressed in a timely manner.</P>
        <P>There are various legislative provisions which provide protection for members of pension schemes and these are kept under review. The Pensions Insolvency Payments scheme (PIPS) is an additional measure introduced by the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009. PIPS provides that pension schemes that have wound up in deficit due to the insolvency of their sponsoring employer may purchase pension payments from the State at a lower rate than would be available on the open market. In this way, it ensures that more resources from the scheme are available to offset the pension liabilities of active and deferred scheme members.</P>
        <P>PIPS came into effect in February this year and is being operated by the Department of Finance. The exact nature of the levels of funding available to employees, following an application to PIPS, will be dependent on individual circumstances. However, I know the scheme itself, operating on a pilot basis, will be subject to an ongoing review in the Department of Finance.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Joan Burton</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if she will comment on the live register figures for February 2010 which indicate that there are 436,956 unemployed or under-employed across the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[11630/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The monthly live register is published by the Central Statistics Office on the basis of data collated by my Department in respect of the last Friday of each month. At the end of March, 2010, the live register stood at <Col N="501"/>435,121.  This represents a decrease of 1,835 on the February figure of 436,956.  The February total was almost unchanged from the January figure of 436,936. </P>
        <P>While these trends are encouraging, I am acutely conscious of the human consequences of unemployment and the need for those affected to get access to financial supports as quickly as possible.  One of the main priorities of my Department is to ensure that customers get paid on time. In this context, effective measures have been taken to manage the growth in the number of claims for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment and to keep delays to a minimum.  These include the introduction of improved processes and procedures to increase productivity and the assignment of additional staff to claim processing.</P>
        <P>Apart from providing people with timely access to financial support after they lose their jobs, it is important that as many people as possible are kept in work and that support is available to help people move from welfare back into employment.  While the primary responsibility for job creation rests with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment, my Department has a role in supporting people from welfare to work.</P>
        <P>The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP), operated jointly with F&Aacute;S, is the main activation measure for jobseekers.  Under the NEAP, everyone who is approaching 3 months on the live register is identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and referred to F&Aacute;S for interview with a view to assisting them enter or re-enter the labour market. 86,782 people were referred to F&Aacute;S under the NEAP in the period from January to December 2009, an increase of 44% over the same period in 2008.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides jobseekers with one-to-one assistance through its facilitator service.  Facilitators work closely with F&Aacute;S and other agencies at a local level and help jobseekers develop individual progression plans to enhance their skills and ultimately improve their employment chances.  22,000 people were referred to facilitators during 2009.</P>
        <P>My Department will also, under the new role it has been given, including responsibility for the employment services of F&Aacute;S and various schemes such as the Community Employment Scheme, will be much more directly involved in providing new opportunities to those who do not get full time employment.</P>
        <P>My Department operates a range of activation programmes and second chance education opportunities which assist unemployed people and other social welfare recipients to improve their employability and personal and family situations.  The back to work enterprise allowance is designed to encourage the long term unemployed to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment, plus secondary benefits, over two years.  At the end of March 2010, there were 5,137 people availing of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The short term enterprise allowance is payable to a person who qualifies for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and who wishes to commence in self employment.  This allowance is payable for the duration of their Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit entitlement.  At end of March 2010 there were 1,393 participants in the scheme.</P>
        <P>The back to education allowance (BTEA) aims to give welfare recipients who left school early and those without third level qualifications a second chance to attain educational qualifications so as to reduce their risk of long term unemployment.  The allowance is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum personal rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  21,096 people were in receipt of BTEA at the end of March 2010.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Education and Science and F&Aacute;S supports the unemployed <Col N="502"/>under a number of new measures.  These include the Work Placement programme, the Short Time Work Training programme, the Back to College Initiative and the redundant apprentice programme.</P>
        <P>The Government is providing, through F&Aacute;S, a total of 147,000 training and activation places for jobseekers.  In addition there were 166,000 places available, including additional provision, education programmes in 2009, while the number of third level places has also increased dramatically over the past ten years.</P>
        <P>The nature and structure of the supports provided by my Department to the people on the live register will continue to be monitored in the context of changes in the economic climate.</P>

	<P>The Government discussion paper, &ldquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents&rsquo;, was published in 2006. It put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents, the focused provision of childcare, improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low-income families with young children. It can be viewed at http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Policy/PolicyPublications/Families/Documents/prop<?oasys _mv3- ?>_<?oasys _mv-3- ?>lp.pdf.</P>
<P>These proposals have informed deliberations regarding the One-Parent Family Payment scheme.</P>
  <P>The current duration of the One-Parent Family Payment, which is payable until the youngest child reaches the age of 18 &mdash; or 22 if in full-time education &mdash; is not in the best interests of the recipient, their children or society.  Social welfare supports for lone parents should be designed to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />prevent long-term dependence on welfare and facilitate financial independence;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />recognise parental choice with regard to care of young children but with the expectation that parents will not remain outside of the labour force indefinitely, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />include an expectation of participation in education, training and employment, with supports provided in this regard.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">To meet these social policy objectives, I will be introducing changes to the One-Parent Family Payment in the forthcoming Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2010.  For new customers, from early 2011, it is proposed that the One-Parent Family Payment will be made until the youngest child in the lone parent family reaches the age of 13 years.  For existing recipients of the payment, there will be a phasing-out period to enable them to access education and training and to prepare them for their return to the labour market.</P>
        <P>These changes will bring Ireland&rsquo;s support for lone parents more into line with international provisions, where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.  The EU countries that are achieving the best outcomes in terms of tackling child poverty are those that are combining strategies aimed at facilitating access to employment and enabling services (e.g. child care) with income support.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 87 together. </P>
        <P>The Government has announced its intention to introduce a carbon tax, which will come into effect on heating products from May 2010 and on solid fuels at a date to be set by commencement order.</P>
        <P>Arrangements are being made to assist those most at risk of fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>In his Carbon Budget Statement, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government outlined details of &euro;130 million in funding for insulation, &euro;76 million of which will be used to assist low income families.  The Government is also conscious that families at risk of fuel poverty will need extra income support to meet the increasing costs of fuel as a result of the carbon tax.</P>
        <P>The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio and has convened an Inter-Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy to coordinate and drive Government policy in this area.</P>
        <P>The Inter-Departmental/Agency Group has been asked to draw up an Energy Affordability Strategy.  This strategy will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability and will have regard both to the impact of the carbon tax on low income households and the range of supports outlined above in making its recommendations.</P>
        <P>As part of its work, the Group will make recommendations as to the precise package of measures, including in the area of income support, that should be put in place to assist those at risk of fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>In the meantime the Department of Social and Family Affairs will continue to assist social welfare recipients with heating costs through their basic payments, through the fuel allowance and through the household benefits package of electricity and gas allowances.</P>
        <P>The household benefits package is payable throughout the year to almost 380,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households to assist them with their heating, light and cooking costs.  This scheme cost approximately &euro;184m in 2009.</P>
        <P>The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the additional cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s heating expenses.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full and must be seen in the context of the overall level of income available to the family.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2009, the duration of the payment was increased by an extra 2 weeks to 32 weeks, while the weekly value of the allowance was increased by &euro;2 to &euro;20 a week, or &euro;23.90 in designated smokeless areas.  This compares with just &euro;14 and &euro;17.90 respectively in 2006.</P>
        <P>Proper household insulation is absolutely vital in tacking fuel poverty. Initiatives such as the Warmer Homes Scheme, operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, have a very valuable role to <Col N="504"/>play in that regard, as does funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to improve the quality of existing local authority housing and the Housing Adaptation Grants for older people and people with disabilities.  Considerable progress has been made in this area in recent years.</P>

        <Quest> if the qualifying criteria for domiciliary care allowance have been altered since administration of the payment has been switched to his Department; the reason many children presenting with exceptional care needs are now being refused; and the details of the refusal rate both before and after the transfer of the function to his Department. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 1 April 2009 this Department has been accepting new claims for Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA).  This follows the transfer of the scheme from the Health Service Executive on foot of a Government decision to reallocate certain functions between Departments and Agencies as part of the health service reform programme. </P>
        <P>The main change to the qualifying conditions for the scheme is that the DCA scheme is now a statutory scheme with the primary legislation provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008.  Prior to the transfer the eligibility criteria for the scheme was set out by way of a Circular from the Department of Health and Children.  The medical criteria as set out in the Department of Health and Children circular states that children &ldquo;who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age may qualify for DCA&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The medical criteria as set out in Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008 require that &ldquo;the child has a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention substantially in excess of the care and attention normally required by a child of the same age&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>As there were no agreed national medical guidelines for the scheme while it was administered in the Health Service Executive, an Expert Medical Group was established in advance of the transfer of functions.  This Group was chaired by this Department&rsquo;s Chief Medical Adviser and comprised senior medical personnel from the HSE as well as eminent professionals in the areas of physical disabilities which affect children and child psychiatry/psychology.  The primary purpose of this Group was to agree a set of consistent and objective guidelines for use nationally in determining eligibility of children for the scheme.  The report of the Group was reviewed independently by external medical experts.</P>
        <P>The Expert Medical Group considered that the most appropriate way for the Department to conduct assessments for medical eligibility was by assessing evidence submitted by the claimant rather than by way of individual examination by the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors as they are not involved in advice or treatment of the child.  The new process in operation in the Department involves the submission of a detailed statement by the parent or guardian of the child; a detailed statement by the child&rsquo;s General practitioner; and any other relevant evidence from qualified experts who have examined the child.  This evidence is assessed by designated Departmental Medical Assessors who have received special training.</P>
        <P>DCA is payable in respect of children who have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  The care and attention received must be given by another person, effectively <Col N="505"/>full-time so that the child can deal with the normal activities of daily life.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</P>
        <P>Eligibility for Domiciliary Care Allowance is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted by the applicant.</P>
        <P>Since 1 April 2009 the Department has been accepting new claims for Domiciliary Care Allowance.  In the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 a total of 4,575 applications have been received in the required format, of which 4,330 cases have been fully processed by the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors and 2,736 of these applications have been deemed not to satisfy the medical criteria.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this Department does not have the information sought in relation to the scheme before the transfer on 1 April 2009.  Where claims are deemed to be ineligible on medical grounds, it is because it is considered that the requirement of care and attention and/or supervision is not substantially in excess of another child of the same age who does not have a disability.</P>
        <P>In the case of an application which is refused on medical grounds, the applicant may submit additional information and/or ask for the case to be reviewed by a different Medical Assessor specially designated for this task.  Where a person is not satisfied with the decision of a Deciding Officer they may appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

	<P>Control savings are calculated by applying validated multipliers to the difference in the rate of payment before and after the control activity.</P>
        <P>Multipliers used in assessing control savings estimate the total future savings to the Department of a revocation or reduction resulting from a control action.  The multiplier used is based on the average amount of time the person who ceases to claim will remain off the books before returning.  This time varies from scheme to scheme.</P>
        <P>There is a comprehensive control guideline which sets out:</P>
<P el="5">(a) What constitutes a control saving in the various control activities;</P>
<P el="5">(b) The various multipliers to be used in determining savings;</P>
<P el="5">(c) The method of reporting reviews and savings.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Control Division carry out ongoing validation exercises to ensure control savings are recorded correctly.  These involve an examination of the various control savings reported to ensure that savings are being compiled and calculated in the correct manner i.e. in accordance with the guideline for determining control savings.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the Department recorded control savings of nearly &euro;484m, or 79% of the target of &euro;616.5m and over 750,000 claims in payment were reviewed, some 121% of the target set for 2009.</P><Col N="506"/>
        <P>It must be noted that in 2009 control activity was significantly focused on prevention of fraud and error at claim application stage.  Savings made from the detection of bogus claims at application stage cannot be estimated as the claim will not go into payment.  However, this is the most cost effective mechanism of reducing losses through fraud and error in social welfare schemes.</P>
        <P>In 2010 a target of &euro;533.3m has been set for control savings.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that control savings provide valid, useful, practical and comparable measures of progress towards achieving results.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> his plans for carers following the decision not to publish the National Carer&rsquo;s Strategy. </Quest>
        <QRef>[15476/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>During 2008, an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process, to develop a National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.  However, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time limits which could be achieved.  In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy.  This position remains unchanged.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers.  It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for all those who are reliant on the State for income support.</P>
        <P>Over the past decade, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit, half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People caring for more than one person receive a higher rate of payment, equating to an additional 50% of the maximum personal rate.  Recipients with children also receive a qualified child increase in respect of each child.</P>
        <P>Following this year&rsquo;s Budget, the carer&rsquo;s allowance rate for carers over 66 years of age has not changed and remains at &euro;239.  The rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance for someone under 66 is &euro;212.</P>
        <P>Since the introduction of the carer&rsquo;s allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively.  As a result, even with the reduction announced in the last Budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carer&rsquo;s allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.</P>
        <P>The means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  A couple with an income in the region of <Col N="507"/>&euro;60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package.</P>
        <P>These levels surpass the &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo; commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to &euro;1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.</P>

	<P>The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department.  A key objective of the Department&rsquo;s control strategy is to ensure that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time.  There are over 620 staff working in areas related to control of fraud and abuse of the welfare system.  At the end of 2009 over 750,000 individual claims were reviewed and the Department recorded control savings of nearly &euro;484m.  The control savings target for 2010 is &euro;533.31m.</P>
        <P>The Department processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and it makes payments to over one million people every week.  The vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.</P>
        <P>The level of fraud on most schemes is very low.  As reported by the C&amp;AG, the percentage of expenditure resulting from fraud identified in the Department&rsquo;s Fraud and Error surveys was 0% for pensioners, 0.1% for Illness Benefit, 0.8% for the Family Income Supplement, and 1.8% for Child Benefit.  Schemes such as Jobseekers Allowance, One Parent Family Payment, Disability Allowance and non-Irish Child Benefit claimants have higher levels of fraud.  The Department intends carrying out fraud and error surveys on two of these schemes each year. This will mean each of the schemes will be renewed every second year.</P>
        <P>Recent control initiatives introduced to curb fraud and abuse of the system include the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Increased control activity is focused on the prevention of fraud and error at claim application stage.  This is the most cost effective mechanism of reducing losses through fraud and error in social welfare schemes although savings from this activity are not included as the claim does not go into payment.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Significant advances have been made to reduce the risk of overpayment through systems &ldquo;talking&rdquo; to each other.  With the introduction of the new Service Delivery Modernisation (SDM) a greater number of the Departments claims and payments are sharing a single technical platform.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Technologies introduced as part of the SDM programme have allowed the Department to run specially designed programmes which interrogate other internal stand-alone systems and report on cases where there may be duplicate payments.</P><Col N="508"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The introduction of a series of certificate processes further enhanced the control functions of the Department.  Certificates issue to the customer for completion e.g. to targeted customer groups by age, payment method, location or country.  Certificates that fail to be returned or are completed incorrectly may result in suspension and/or termination.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />As a fraud preventative measure the option to receive payments by Electronic Fund Transfer (bank account) was removed for new claimants for jobseeker payments.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Border regions put an increased emphasis on control of claims from applicants with a previous address in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />One Parent Family Payment recipients with earnings are the subject of ongoing review.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The frequency of issue of mail shots to validate continued entitlement to Child Benefit has been increased to 3 monthly intervals for EU worker customers and resident non-Irish national customers.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Department is moving to a risk-based system of claim review, which it is hoped will achieve better value for money by focusing scarce resources on the most appropriate cases.  This involves assigning and recording a risk rating at the award and review stage.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />From 7th January 2010, members of the public report suspected Social Welfare fraud anonymously to the Department by completing a new on-line form on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.welfare.ie.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />New data matches have been initiated to effectively target reviews and generate savings.  </P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />New anti-fraud measures have been included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009 which<b> </b>provide for the transfer of bulk information relating to recipients of social welfare payments to the competent authority of another Member State or international organisation or other country with which a reciprocal agreement has been made.</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The first Public Service Cards are expected to be issued in the second half of 2010.  The PSC will include a photograph and signature.  One of the anticipated advantages of the new card is that it will help to reduce fraud and error which result from the incorrect identification of benefit claimants.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of a Centralised Special Investigation Unit within the Department in<b> </b>February, 2010 allows for a more integrated approach to  prevention and detection of social welfare abuse in conjunction with other areas of the Department involved in fraud and control work.  The unit will work with other agencies such as Revenue, NERA, Customs and the Garda and ensure that control activity is being targeted at high risk categories of claimants/employers.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Department is committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them.  In this regard the control programme of the Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 659 together. </P>
        <P>The recently published National Pensions Framework is the Government&rsquo;s plan for future pension reform.  It encompasses all aspects of pensions, from social welfare to private occupational pensions and public sector pension reform. Development of the framework was informed by the range of views raised during the comprehensive consultation process which followed publication of the Green Paper on Pensions.  The aim of the framework is to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State.  It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and to ensure that State support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.</P>
        <P>A technical implementation group is now being established to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the reforms into operation and the group will hold its first meeting in early May.  The implementation phase is expected to take three to five years.  In line with the Government decision, the group will be chaired by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and it will include representatives from the Department of An Taoiseach, the Department of Finance, the Pensions Board and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The implementation group will be cognisant of the current and emerging economic condition and will conduct extensive consultation on the many aspects of the framework before presenting final options to Government for decision.  The group will develop a communications strategy to ensure that all stakeholders and interested parties are kept informed of the progress being made in implementing the framework.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that during 2009 the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 24 weeks.  However, if allowance was made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to 15.8 weeks.  This represents an increase of 2 weeks in the time taken to process appeals when compared to 2008, but must be seen in the context of an increase of 46% in the number of appeals received during 2009. </P>
        <P>During 2009, a total of 17,787 appeals were finalised of which 4,873 (26.9%) were revised on review by the Deciding Officer in favour of the appellant without going to appeal; 10,027 decisions were made by Appeals Officers of which 59.9% were decided following an oral hearing with the remaining 40.1% decided following a summary examination of the documentary evidence produced. 2,887 appeals were withdrawn or not otherwise produced by appellant.</P>
        <P>The processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examination <Col N="510"/>by the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors in certain illness related cases, further investigation by Social Welfare Inspectors where required and circumstances may also arise where further information is sought from the appellant.</P>
        <P>To deal with the increased workload being experienced by the Social Welfare Appeals Office, two additional Appeals Officers were appointed during 2009.  The possibility of assigning further additional resources on a temporary basis is currently under consideration.</P>
        <P>In addition, changes have recently been made to processes in the Social Welfare Appeals Office with a view to achieving additional productivity.  I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the outcome of these changes under continuous review to ensure the optimum throughput of appeals with full regard to due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</P>

	<P>The farm assist scheme which was introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 1999 is a response by the Department to the situation of low-income farmers and it represents a long-term safety net for them.  It benefits farm families with children and also provides increased payments to farming couples without children and to single farmers on low income.</P>
        <P>While this means-tested payment is broadly similar to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme, it has a more generous means test, which takes account of the specific nature of farming and, unlike jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, farmers claiming this payment do not need to be available for work outside of the farm in order to qualify.</P>

	<P>The process of transferring functions from one Department to another is carried out by means of Government Orders.  Each Order needs to be carefully drafted so that all relevant legislation is listed in the Schedule to the Order.  The Departments which currently hold the functions which are being transferred to my Department are fully engaged in this task at present.  The draft Orders will need to be finalised and settled in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel before they can be brought to Government. </P>
        <P>Once this process has been finalised, it is the Minister for Finance who brings the necessary Orders to Government.  At this stage, I cannot give a precise date for the formal transfer of functions as this depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of the legislation governing the particular functions.</P>

	<P>The Department&rsquo;s facilitators work with social welfare recipients of working age, including people in receipt of jobseekers payments, people parenting alone, people in receipt of disability welfare payments and people providing care, to promote participation and social inclusion. </P>
        <P>Facilitators help people to identify appropriate training or development programmes which will enhance the skills that the individual has and ultimately improve their employment chances, as well as help them to continue to develop personally.  Facilitators develop individual progression plans with the customer.  They are located throughout the country and are assigned to <Col N="512"/>cover defined geographical areas.  They work closely with F&Aacute;S and other agencies at a local level to identify and target appropriate education, training and development opportunities.</P>
        <P>In the current economic climate the demand for the facilitator service is elevated.  Facilitators make every effort to contact customers as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>A formal targeted programme of activation was introduced under the National Development Plan (NDP).  Under this programme, the Department actively selects cases for referral to facilitators.  Over 22,000 cases were referred to facilitators during 2009.</P>
        <P>The facilitator service was enhanced under the National Development Plan (NDP) Social and Economic Participation Programme.  24 additional facilitators have been appointed since September, 2008.  There are 62 currently serving (full time equivalent 60.4 posts).  It is intended to increase the number to 70 posts. Clerical support for facilitators is provided centrally by Employment Support Services section.</P>
        <P>Under the Technical Assistance and training scheme (TATS), a welfare recipient may qualify for a grant up to a maximum of &euro;1,000.  The grant is mainly targeted towards certain business start-up expenses of clients in receipt of the back to work enterprise allowance scheme.  This fund is designed to enhance the person&rsquo;s prospects of succeeding in becoming independent of the social welfare system through support for training in the areas of starting a business, book-keeping/accounts, preparation of business plans, marketing, literacy and computer training or assistance with the purchase of small items of equipment.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;3.5m was spent under the technical assistance and training scheme in 2009.</P>
        <P>The number of facilitators in place, their workload, and the effectiveness of the service will continue to be monitored.</P>

	<P>The rent supplement scheme provides short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The scheme&rsquo;s primary purpose is to provide short term assistance, as opposed to acting as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. </P>
        <P>There are currently almost 95,000 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment &mdash; an increase of over 57 per cent since the end of 2005.  The total cost of the rent supplement scheme for 2009 was &euro;511m.</P>
        <P>Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to their accommodation needs and to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household and market conditions.  Furthermore, it is essential that State support for tenants does not give rise to inflated rental prices and overcharging by landlords.</P>
        <P>Setting or retaining maximum rent limits at levels higher than are justified by the open market can have a distorting effect on the market, leading to a more general rise in rent <Col N="513"/>levels.  This in turn may worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes who are trying to support themselves without State aid.</P>
        <P>A review of maximum rent supplement levels is in process and is expected to be completed shortly.  This process will ensure that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country, and that they will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 108 together. </P>
        <P>The challenges facing the Irish pension system are clearly outlined in the National Pensions Framework.  In particular, it is noted that the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population. There are currently six workers for every pensioner and this ratio will decrease to less than two to one by 2050.</P>
        <P>Increasing state pension age is one of the ways in which we can sustain the pensions system and also maintain the value of the State Pension at 35% of average earnings.</P>
        <P>People are living longer and healthier lives with average life expectancy set to rise even further in the future, up to 89 years for women and 83 for men.  People will still, therefore, be spending at least the same amount of time in retirement as they are today, even with a later State pension age.</P>
        <P>At present, the majority of people qualify for State Pension at age 66.  From 2014, age 66 will be the standard pension age for everyone.  The qualifying age will be increased to 67 years of age in 2021 and 68 in 2028.</P>
        <P>In order for changes in the pensions area to have an impact, attitudes must change in relation to longer working from both employers and employees.  At the workplace level, employers must seek to retain older employees and create working conditions which will make working longer both attractive and feasible for the older worker.  Where this is not possible and people leave paid employment before state pension age, they will be entitled to apply for another social welfare payment until they become eligible for a State Pension, as is the current situation.</P>
        <P>While public service pensions are a matter for the Minister for Finance, the Deputy may be aware that &lsquo;new entrant&rsquo; Ministers as defined in the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 will not be entitled to receive a ministerial pension until age 65, at the earliest.  The new public service pension scheme which was announced by the Minister for Finance in Budget 2010 will include Ministers and it is proposed that pension age will be linked to the State pension age.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Persons who have moved from another EU Member State (including Northern Ireland or other parts of the UK) and who have been employed since arrival in this State are protected by the EU Regulations on social security for migrant workers.  Where necessary, contributions paid under the social security provisions in their previous State can be aggregated with Irish PRSI contributions to provide entitlement to benefit payments.  The EU Regulations also prescribe conditions under which such a person who becomes involuntarily unemployed may access supplementary welfare allowance if there is no entitlement to a benefit payment, or while waiting a decision on an application for benefit.  If a person has not worked since arrival in this State, the EU Regulations do not apply.</P>
        <P>The habitual residence condition applies to all claimants for certain social assistance payments and child benefit.  The EU non-discrimination rules prevent a Member State introducing legal provisions or administrative practices that grant advantages to their own nationals or any other group of EU citizens that are not commonly available to all EU citizens.</P>
        <P>Decisions concerning habitual residence are subject to five factors which are incorporated into social welfare legislation.  The five factors are:</P>
<P el="5">(a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</P>
<P el="5">(b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</P>
<P el="5">(c) the nature and pattern of the person&rsquo;s employment;</P>
<P el="5">(d) the person&rsquo;s main centre of interest, and</P>
<P el="5">(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Given the freedom of movement within the Common Travel Area, periods of residence in Northern Ireland will be taken into account in considering the first of these factors, especially where such residence was immediately prior to the person moving to live in Ireland.  Also, for practical reasons a person who has been residing in Northern Ireland may be able to move permanent residence to this State more easily than people coming from other countries.  Such factual considerations may be taken into account in determining whether the habitual residence condition is satisfied or not in each particular case without any conflict with the non-discrimination provisions.</P>
        <P>Where a person has established their habitual residence here, the full range of social assistance supports is available to him or her.</P>

	<P>Spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are thus liable to pay social insurance contributions. </P>
        <P>On foot of a Programme for Government commitment an information leaflet, &lsquo;Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements&rsquo;, has been developed between the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business.  It was published on the 25th of June, 2008.</P>
        <P>The leaflet clarifies that spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria. In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI and build up entitlement towards a contributory state pension and other social welfare benefits.  Following the above campaign, more than one thousand applications for commercial partnership status have been received.  Of these 579 applications have been finalised, of which 508 cases are approved.</P>
        <P>A widow/widower may apply to the Department&rsquo;s Scope Section for recognition that she/he operated a commercial partnership with her/his spouse while the spouse was alive.

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The overall response to the industrial action is being managed centrally by the Department of Finance with input from all Government Departments, including the Department, and other public service sectors.  The industrial action is being closely monitored in the Department on a daily basis and the Department&rsquo;s management is maintaining contacts with the unions concerned to ensure, insofar as possible, that the negative impact on the Department&rsquo;s customers is minimised. </P>
        <P>In the main, the industrial action in the Department involved staff not answering telephones; failing to provide counter services in public offices for various periods; failure to complete certain statistical work returns; and failure to use certain computer systems.  It also involved a ban on overtime in the Illness Benefit area from 22 February 2010 and this ban was extended to other areas of the Department for four weeks from 15th March to 9th April.</P><Col N="516"/>
        <P>In five local offices the Civil Public and Services Union instructed staff not to process medical certificates locally but to send them by post to the central Illness Benefit Section in Dublin.  This would have resulted in a delay of one or two days in issuing payment to the customers affected. While the number of claims awaiting a decision has stayed broadly the same at about 6,800 over this period, there was an increase in the time taken to process Illness Benefit claims from about 6 days to an average of 8 days during the period of the industrial action.</P>
        <P>In some areas, because staff were not answering phones or attending the public counters, backlogs were reduced and processing times improved as these staff were diverted to claim processing.  Consequently, there is no backlog of claims that can be directly attributed to the industrial action.</P>
        <P>However there have been significant arrears of jobseekers claims over the past 18 months or so due to the huge influx of applications for these schemes. However, the number of claims awaiting a decision has been declining every week since the end of January, when they stood at over 62,000 to 47,500 at week ending 27 March.  The number increased to 52,800 after the Easter break.</P>
        <P>However, this is normal, as there is always a significant increase in claims from school related workers around any school holiday period.  This, combined with the impact of the shorter working weeks at this time, has resulted in an increase in the number of jobseeker claims awaiting a decision.</P>
        <P>Overall, the number of jobseeker claims awaiting a decision expressed as a percentage of the entire claimload nationally is now at about 10%.  This is the level of claims awaiting a decision that applied even when the Live Register was at its lowest.  I know there are some local offices where the percentage of claims awaiting a decision is much higher but we are working to bring them in line with the national average as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The work to rule is ongoing.  However following discussions between the unions and the Department of Finance, there has been some relaxation of the industrial action.</P>

	<P>Under the  supplementary welfare allowance scheme the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE) may award a travel supplement in any case where it appears to the Executive that the circumstances of the case so warrant. The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Up to the 9th April 2010, the expenditure under the travel supplement scheme was &euro;340,000; the projected outturn for 2010 for this scheme is &euro;1.3 million.  The total expenditure for travel supplements in 2009 was &euro;1.3 million. </P>
        <P>Where the travel costs are non-recurring the HSE may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected <Col N="517"/>to meet out of their weekly income.  Up to 9 April 2010, the expenditure for once-off travel costs was &euro;633,000; and the projected outturn for 2010 for this scheme is &euro;2.6 million.  The total expenditure for once-off travel cost payments in 2009 was &euro;2.6 million.</P>
        <P>The Free Travel scheme, administered by my Department at an annual cost of &euro;73.5 million in 2009, is available to people over age 66 and to those with disabilities in receipt of certain social welfare payments such as Invalidity Pension, Blind Pension and Disability Allowance.  This scheme permits a recipient to travel for free on most CIE public transport services, LUAS and a range of services offered by a large number of private operators in various parts of the country.  Free travel is also available on cross-Border journeys between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Customers aged 66 years and over can travel for free on journeys within Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Free Travel scheme, the Department, in recognition of the carriage of Free Travel passholders, provided annual funding of &euro;1.5 million towards the Rural Transport Programme in 2009 and will do so again in 2010.<b>  </b>It is acknowledged that Free Travel passholders clearly benefit from the initiative, particularly those who had no access to public transport prior to the setting up of the Programme.</P>
        <P>The social partnership agreement, <i>Towards 2016</i>, includes a commitment that the issues around the introduction of a cost of disability payment will be considered following the development of a needs assessment system under the Disability Act.  This follows an inter-departmental examination of the issue by a working group and research commissioned on its behalf by the National Disability Authority.</P>
        <P>The working group, which was chaired by the Department of Health and Children, concluded that consideration of the introduction of a cost of disability payment is dependent on both the availability of comprehensive data and, in particular, a structured process of the assessment of need.</P>
        <P>The Sectoral Plan of the Department of Health and Children, in accordance with Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, establishes a system for the assessment of individual needs for people with a disability.  I understand that further consideration by the Department of Health and Children of the issues around the cost of disability will be contingent on the full implementation of the needs assessment system provided for in the Disability Act.</P>

        <Quest> if he will seek to have the budget changes to the dental treatment benefit scheme, which resulted in the cost of dental services increasing by 14.6%, reversed. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Treatment Benefit Scheme offers assistance towards the cost of Optical and Dental Treatment and the provision of Hearing aids. The scheme is paid from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF). Although the SIF has operated a surplus since 1996, this position began to change last year, and expenditure had to be partially funded from the accumulated Exchequer surplus. It is estimated that, by the first half of 2010, the Exchequer will be required to subvent the SIF by over &euro;1 billion.</P>
        <P>The expenditure pressures on the Fund will continue in the near future. Therefore, the most pressing needs right now are to ease the pressure on the SIF and to get the public finances back on track. As part of a range of cost-saving measures, the Dental Benefit Scheme has been amended for 2010.</P><Col N="518"/>
        <P>The treatment available under the scheme has been limited from 1 January 2010 to a free Dental Examination. The continued provision of the free examination will not only help identify routine dental problems but also more serious health issues. Its continuation should encourage people to continue attending for checkups, and help address the concerns expressed about the general dental health of the public.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the Department provided some 418,000 free Dental Examinations and current trends in 2010 indicate that a similar number will attend for the free examination this year.</P>
        <P>Regarding the potential increases in consumer costs, in 2009 the Department paid an average of &euro;84 for each Dental Benefit claim. As the Department will continue to pay &euro;33.50 for each Examination, this represents an average potential increase to customers of just over &euro;50 per year.</P>
        <P>The reported potential 14.6% increase in the cost of dental treatment is also largely predicated on dental prices remaining at 2009 levels. However, there appears to have been a significant increase in competition in the dental care market in Ireland in recent months. Within a short period of the announcement of the scheme changes, one major dental chain announced a price cut of 30%, and the Irish Dental Association subsequently announced that its members would either freeze or reduce their prices. These developments, and several publicised price cuts since then, are to be welcomed as they will help make dental treatment more affordable for consumers.</P>
        <P>Tax refunds are available from the Revenue Commissioners for certain kinds of more expensive dental treatment. The significantly increased number of people with Medical Cards are also covered for treatment through the DTSS dental scheme operated by the Department of Health. These forms of cover, along with the retention of free Examinations and enhanced competition, mean that routine dental care should remain affordable and general oral health in Ireland will remain good.</P>
        <P>The changes made to the dental benefit scheme will provide significant savings to the Exchequer in 2010. The Treatment Benefit scheme will be reviewed prior to the next budget, when a decision on its future structure will be made taking account of the prevailing economic circumstances at that time.</P>

It is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.</P>
        <P>Payment under the scheme covers the relevant academic year and the scheme caters for approved courses where the starting date is not aligned to the standard academic year. The Back to Education Allowance scheme covers full-time courses of education from second level to higher diploma level in any discipline and to a graduate diploma in education.</P><Col N="519"/>
        <P>Changes to provide for earlier access to the scheme were announced in the April 2009 Supplementary Budget.  In order to qualify for participation an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 3 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  A two year qualifying period applies to participants coming from Illness Benefit.</P>
        <P>The qualifying period for access to third level courses is reduced to 9 months for those who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process or engaging with the Department&rsquo;s facilitator programme.  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
        <P>The Government has devoted significant resources to the Back to Education Allowance scheme.  &euro;519m has been allocated over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2007-13.  In 2009, expenditure on the scheme was &euro;107.3 million. The number of participants increased significantly in 2009.  A total of 21,096 participants were availing of the scheme at the end of March 2010 which is 81% higher than the 11,646 recorded at the end of 2008/09 academic year.</P>
        <P>The potential for further changes in certain areas was identified by my predecessor to the Oireachtas Committee on Social Welfare.  These concerned duration, access to post-graduate courses, appropriateness of courses and progression.  The final shape and scope of such changes are currently under consideration.</P>
        <P>The Back to Education Allowance scheme has an important role to play in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers.  The nature and structure of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.</P>

	<P>The Treatment Benefit Scheme offers assistance towards the cost of Optical and Dental Treatment and the provision of Hearing aids. The scheme is paid from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF). Although the SIF has operated a surplus since 1996, this position began to change last year, and expenditure had to be partially funded from the accumulated Exchequer surplus. It is estimated that, by the first half of 2010, the Exchequer will be required to subvent the SIF by over &euro;1 billion. </P>
        <P>The expenditure pressures on the Fund will continue in the near future. Therefore, the most pressing needs right now are to ease the pressure on the SIF and to get the public finances back on track. As part of a range of cost-saving measures, the Dental Benefit Scheme has been amended for 2010.</P>
        <P>The treatments available under the scheme have been limited from 1 January 2010 to a free Dental Examination. The continued provision of the free examination will not only help identify routine dental problems but also more serious health issues. Its continuation should encourage people to continue attending for check-ups, and help address the concerns expressed about the general dental health of the public.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the Department provided some 418,000 free Dental Examinations and current trends in 2010 indicate that a similar number will attend for the free examination this year.</P><Col N="520"/>
        <P>In addition some 150,000 customers who had applied for approval to commence dental benefit treatments prior to 31 December, either directly to the Department or whose dentist applied on their behalf, will receive the full range of treatments available under the scheme as operated prior to 1 January 2010, provided their treatment commenced within three months of approval being given.</P>
        <P>There is evidence that increased competition in the dental care market is having an effect on price. Shortly after the announcement of the changes to the scheme, one major dental chain announced a price cut of 30%, and the Irish Dental Association subsequently announced that its members would either freeze or reduce their prices. These developments, and anecdotal evidence of price reductions since then, are to be welcomed as they will make dental treatment more affordable for consumers.</P>
        <P>Tax refunds are available from the Revenue Commissioners for certain kinds of more expensive dental treatment. The significantly increased number of customers with Medical Cards are also covered for treatment through the DTSS dental scheme operated by the Department of Health. These forms of cover, along with the retention of free Examinations and enhanced competition, mean that routine dental care should remain affordable and general oral health in Ireland will remain good.</P>
        <P>The changes made to the dental benefit scheme will provide significant savings to the Exchequer in 2010. The Treatment Benefit scheme will be reviewed prior to the next budget, when a decision on its future structure will be made taking account of the prevailing economic circumstances at that time.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 112 together. </P>
        <P>The Social Inclusion Division of my Department is carrying out a detailed analysis of the impact of the entire Budget package, and not just the social welfare elements of it, using the SWITCH integrated tax and social welfare model developed by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). This will include an analysis of the impact of Budget 2010 on the &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo; rate as well as the combined impact of the three budgets, Budget 2009, the April 2010 Supplementary Budget and the most recent Budget. This is a complex piece of work using a methodology to enable changes in wages and incomes to be taken into account. As the ESRI itself has acknowledged the &ldquo;scale and complexity of the Budget 2010 package mean that it will take more time than usual to analyse&rdquo;. Work on this analysis is continuing and is <Col N="521"/>expected to be finalised in the near future. This work will be published and will provide an initial basis for assessing the impact on poverty of Budget 2010, pending the compilation and publication in due course of the official statistics for 2009 and 2010 by the CSO. These will be set out in the EU-SILC publications.</P>
        <P>It should be noted however that the ESRI made some initial assessments of the Budget in its Quarterly Economic Commentary published late last year. As well as looking at Budget 2010 on its own, the Institute measured the impact on family unit and household income of the last three Budgets, that is, the October 2008, April 2009 and December 2009 Budgets together. They adopted this approach as these three Budgets represent the Government&rsquo;s consolidated approach to tackling the recession. The Institute found that, on this basis, the average income of the poorest households hardly changed, the income for the next group of households increased by around 2% while the middle to top income households experienced a loss of income.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to further adjust social welfare rates of payment in 2010. The appropriate levels for 2011 will be considered as part of the Budgetary process later this year and in the context of continuing to reduce overall public expenditure and restoring stability to the public finances.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 723 to 725, inclusive, 727 and 729 together.<b></b></P>
        <P>Details on claim volumes, claims pending, processing times, and backlogs (where they exist) for all schemes are detailed in Table 1.</P>
        <P>Details of average Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance claims pending and processing times by Social Welfare Local Office are detailed in Tables 2-4 and details<?oasys _jy ?>of cases currently on appeal and average appeals processing times are detailed separately in Table 5.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers. To this end, operational processes and procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed in all areas of the Department. These reviews are supported by modern technology, the potential of which is continually harnessed. Claims are processed in the most efficient and expeditious way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.</P>
        <P>Processing times vary across schemes because of both the volume of applications and the differing qualification criteria. For example, means assessments are required for all of the social assistance schemes; medical examinations are required for illness related schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence conditions. In the case of the insurance based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that many factors outside the Department&rsquo;s control can impact upon claim processing times e.g. the supply of relevant information by the customer, employers or other third parties.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, it is important to remember that people who have urgent income support needs can apply for the means tested supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) and that more than 95% of basic SWA applications are decided on and paid within a week.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Specific Process Improvements</i></P>
        <P el="0">From January 2009, new processing targets, based on processing 90% of claims within a particular timescale, varying from scheme to scheme, were introduced for all schemes. Specific process improvements have also been introduced across many areas of the Department. Some examples are as follows:</P>
       <P el="10"><i>Jobseekers</i></P>
        <P el="0">Some 450 extra staff have been assigned to local offices, new Central Support Units and the Departments Inspectorate. At the same time the Department has been examining procedures surrounding the claim acceptance and decisions process with a view to streamlining them and achieving greater efficiencies where possible. They include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><?oasys _dc18- ?>An appointment system whereby claimants can have their claim taken and decided on during the appointment. This particular initiative has helped greatly in reducing waiting times. This is in operation in 38 local offices and it is planned that it will be extended to others.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to Jobseekers Allowance when their Jobseekers Benefit expires.</P><Col N="523"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous two years.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Application forms for the Jobseeker schemes are now available on the Department&rsquo;s website. This means that anyone who wants to make a claim can print the form at home and bring it to the local office completed. This helps to reduce queuing times.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />More straight-forward procedures for providing evidence of identity and address have been introduced.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Simplified processing methods have been introduced for some claimants who work casually, part-time or are classed as Systematic Short-Time workers.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The number of JA and JB claims awaiting a decision at the 10 April was 52,815. This is a huge reduction on the 82,000 that were pending in July 2009. This illustrates that the additional resources that have been assigned to local offices coupled with the range of process improvement initiatives are having a positive effect.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that even when the Live Register was at its lowest, there would always be 9 or 10 per cent of claims awaiting a decision.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>State Pensions</i></P>
        <P el="0" Just="Left">In order to ensure that entitlement to a pension is decided by the due date all pensioners are advised to apply at least three months in advance of pension age and people are proactively invited to claim. In addition, a desk assessment process has been introduced in State Pension Non-Contributory, whereby claims are processed and decided on based on the information provided by the customer on their application form without recourse to investigation by a Social Welfare Inspector.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Automated processing and On-line Application Forms</i></P>
        <P el="0">To ensure that claims are processed as efficiently as possible and that customers receive their entitlements in a timely manner all application forms have been designed to facilitate the use of scanning and automated processing. An on-line facility to enable applications for a number of schemes, i.e. State Pension (Contributory) and Household Benefits, to be completed and submitted on-line, has been implemented. This facility will be extended to other schemes in the coming months. The objective is to enable people to access services at a time and place that best suits their needs. The use of on-line application forms reduces the administrative burden for customers and facilitates efficient processing of claims by the Department.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Appeals Processing</i></P>
        <P el="0">The number of Appeals pending at the end of March 2010 and the average processing times for Appeals across all schemes for 2009 are detailed in Table 5 below.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Overall, the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 24 weeks in 2009. However, if allowance was made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to 15.8 weeks. This represents an increase of 2 weeks in the time taken to process appeals when compared with 2008, but must be seen in the context of an increase of 46% in the number of appeals received during 2009. There has, however, been an increase of a further 46% in the number of appeals received in the first quarter of 2010 when compared with the same period last year and there is a concern that this will lead to a further increase in processing times in 2010.</P><Col N="524"/>
        <P>The processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examination by the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors in certain illness related cases, further investigation by Social Welfare Inspectors where required and circumstances may also arise where further information is sought from the appellant.</P>
        <P>To deal with the increased workload being experienced by the Social Welfare Appeals Office, two additional Appeals Officers were appointed during 2009. However the Chief Appeals Officer and 5 experienced Appeals Officers retired and, although their positions have since been filled, these retirements, when coupled with the serious increase in appeals received, have impacted on the processing of appeals. Because of the quasi-judicial nature and complexity of the work there can be a relatively long lead-in time before Appeals Officers become fully competent to deal with the full range of cases coming to the Office. The matter of assigning additional Appeals Officers is kept under constant review but any consideration of extra assignments must be taken in the context of overall government policy on civil service numbers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Chief Appeals Officer is keeping current processes under continual review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government chaired an All-Party Group on Seanad Reform, the aim of which was to establish  the extent of cross party agreement on this issue.  While all political parties agreed that there should be significant reform of the Seanad, there was no cross-party consensus on major constitutional reform.  </P>

        <asker>Deputy Richard Bruton</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
        <Quest> the progress made to date in establishing a centre for financial services skills; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The concept of a Centre for Financial Services Skills arose during the consideration being given to the level of world class skills, education and training required to sustain and further develop the international financial services industry in this country.  Addressing the skills needs of the industry both in terms of quality and quantity was seen as one of paramount importance to the continued success of the industry.</P>
        <P>With this in mind, and before the establishment of such a body, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs was requested by the Clearing House Group to examine the skills needs of the entire international financial services industry and to put in place a strategy to ensure a continued and sustainable supply of skills to meet the needs of employers.  This Group produced their report in December 2007. From the study and the research undertaken by the Expert Group it was clear that no one academic institution had the capacity alone to cater for all the highly desired skill sets identified as being in short supply.  This changed the emphasis from the idea of a physical location, i.e., a Centre,  towards an education initiative to address the shortage of skill sets required for the industry, some at entry level and others at medium stage level.</P>
        <P>A Subgroup on Skills was mandated by the Clearing House Group, at its meeting on 12 June 2008, to bring forward immediate action to address the findings of the Expert Group.  The Subgroup developed a proposal referred to as the &ldquo;Fenero Initiative&rdquo; which included the key elements of what now forms the Finuas Networks Programme (Finuas).  The model involved co-investment by the State and firms, which had proven to be highly successful in the Skillnets Training Networks Programme since 1999 in a range of sectors and regions.  Skillnets Ltd was appointed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as the managing agent for Finuas in late November 2008.</P><Col N="538"/>
        <P>The Finuas Networks Programme is dedicated to specialised training within the international financial services industry and is jointly funded by the Government and companies within the industry.  Finuas is envisaged to run for up to 5 years with &euro;1m allocated from the National Training Fund in both 2009 and 2010.  Finuas aims to support the industry in maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s position as a top international financial services centre through investment in the specialist skills and expertise of its workforce.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I launched the Report of the Innovation Taskforce in the Science Gallery, Trinity College on 11 March.  As I stated at the launch, I very much welcome the Report which provides a roadmap for one of the five Action Areas in the Smart Economy Framework and complements the progress which has already been made on other aspects of the strategy. Specifically, it endorses the Government&rsquo;s vision for Ireland as a Global Innovation Hub and suggests that we have the potential to achieve this goal. The Report has made a wide range of recommendations, some involving new initiatives while others call for a reinforcement and better alignment of existing efforts and programmes.  </P>
        <P>The Government will shortly announce the establishment of a High Level Implementation Committee to consider and oversee the implementation of the Taskforce&rsquo;s Report. This Committee will reflect the recent changes in Departmental structures and responsibilities including the increased emphasis on innovation as part of the refocussed Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, as well as some specific re-allocations of Departmental responsibilities <Col N="541"/>which will be supportive in progressing the Taskforce&rsquo;s recommendations.  In the meantime, progress is already underway in a number of Government Departments in prioritising implementation of  Taskforce recommendations which can be progressed in the short term.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 to 129, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>The two main courses that F&Aacute;S run are Gas Installer Safety (GIS) and Gas Boiler Installer Domestic (GID).  It no longer runs Gas Installer 1 (GI1) and Gas Installer 2 (GI2) training programmes.</P>
        <P>To be accepted onto the GID training course individuals must have successfully participated and completed an Advanced Craft Certificate in Plumbing or a Gas Installation &amp; Safety Certificate (GIS), both of which are FETAC accredited.  Possession of a Gas Installer 1 (GI1) training certificate is not a pre-requisite for entry onto this course.</P>
        <P>The entry requirements for acceptance onto a GIS training course are to be in possession of one or more of the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>(i) <?oasys _ix ?>A National Craft Certificate in allied trade/EU equivalent of NCC;</P>
        <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p2- ?>(ii) <?oasys _ix ?>A City &amp; Guilds Certificate (Advanced) in allied trade;</P>

        <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p2- ?>(v) <?oasys _ix ?>A letter of introduction signed by a nominated person from Bord Gais or Calor Gas or Flo-Gas in respect of individuals who have relevant experience in the gas industry or,</P>
        <P el="5">(vi) <?oasys _ix ?>An OFTEC/IOI Certificate (issued by the UK Accreditation Service (UKAS)).</P>
<P FLI="0">The table below sets out the number of persons who were on the Live Register who have completed the GIS and GID training courses in the last 24 months.  Training allowances are not payable on GIS and GID courses.  As the duration of each training course is only 12 days, on a practical level it is more appropriate to leave those relevant trainees on the Live Register during their training.  This avoids any administrative delay in the payment of social welfare payments that might ensue as part of the process of rejoining the Live Register on completion of the training.</P>

	<P>Public sector bodies are subject to the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 388 of 2002).  Under these Regulations, it is an implied term of every commercial transaction that where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date, the supplier shall be entitled to interest (&ldquo;late payment interest&rdquo;) on the amount outstanding. In the absence of any agreed payment date between the parties (i.e. specified in the contract), late payment interest falls due after 30 days has elapsed, provided the invoice is not subject to query. Interest applies until such time as payment is made by the purchaser. The current late payment interest rate from 1 January 2010 is 8% (that is based on the ECB rate of 1% plus the margin of 7%). The Regulations also provide for compensation for debt recovery costs. </P>
        <P>In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s Decision of 19 May 2009 all central Government Departments are now required to pay their business suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a <Col N="546"/>valid invoice.  As a result, Departments are required to give greater priority to making timely payments and to ensure that suppliers themselves are aware of how they can assist the process by meeting the requirements of Departments in relation to the submission of invoices.  Departments are also required to report quarterly to my Department on their performance in meeting this target.</P>
        <P>On the basis of figures published by my Department in respect of the last two quarters of 2009, Government Departments are continuing to make strong efforts to pay their suppliers within 15 days and are having an impact in assisting Irish SMEs cash flow in the current difficult economic environment.</P>
        <P>I believe there is scope to shorten public sector payment periods in areas beyond the central Government Departments and I will be bringing forward appropriate proposals shortly.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> the position regarding statutory redundancy payments in respect of persons who have lost their jobs at an employer (details supplied) in County Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[14490/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  </P>
        <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department received 36 statutory lump sum claims for the former employees of this company and one rebate claim over various dates between November 2009 and February 2010.  These claims await processing. In respect of lump sum claims paid directly to employees such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from August 2009.</P>
        <P>The impact on business of the current severe economic conditions has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the level of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department.  This has impacted significantly on customer service targets.  The scale of the challenge on the Redundancy side is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P><Col N="547"/>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  The number of claims processed and paid by the Redundancy Payments Section in 2009 amounted to 50,664, an increase of 70% over 2008.  In the first quarter of 2010, my Department processed 21,122 claims an increase of over 151% on the previous first quarter in 2009.  Claims processed in the month of March 2010 was the highest ever achieved in the Section with 8,168 claims processed in the month.  In the year to date, inroads have been made on the backlog of claims on hand, which reduced from 41,168 at the end January 2010 to 37,054 at the end of March 2010.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the payment of redundancy and insolvency payments is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection.  The intention is to transfer by Government order, the payment functions arising under the Redundancy Payment and Insolvency Payment schemes.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</P>

	<P>The marketing of individual properties for new or expansion investment is a day-to-day operational matter for IDA, as part of the statutory responsibilities assigned to it by the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by IDA that the Agency promotes a variety of property solutions in Fermoy, including the Mill Island office facility, as part of its marketing strategy to secure valuable investment for the North Cork area.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Mill Island facility in particular, IDA Ireland had discussions with the owners and sent an IDA representative to view the facility to assess its suitability for IDA client use.  As a result, IDA Ireland has listed the facility in its property portfolio of available <Col N="548"/>office premises in County Cork and actively promotes the facility in response to specific client queries.  IDA has assured me that it will continue to promote the facility but have stressed that it is also important the owners of the Mill Island facility and other interested stakeholders instigate their own marketing programme to promote the facility as widely as possible.</P>
        <P>While IDA strives to attract companies across the full range of targeted sectors, it should be noted that different industry sectors have different property requirements and in the final analysis it is the investor who decides where to locate.</P>

	<P>In November 2004 the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced a policy change to the Job Initiative Programme that provided for contracts to be renewed for participants who wished to remain on the scheme thus removing the requirement for participants to leave. This policy change brought about an amendment to the rules regarding redundancy payments and allowed for the payment of enhanced redundancy to persons made redundant after November 2004.</P>
        <P>I understand that the matter in question relates to persons employed under a Job Initiative Scheme who were made redundant in November 2003, prior to the rule change, and therefore they would not have an entitlement to an enhanced redundancy payment.</P>

	<P>My Department provides funding to a number of Agencies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards and Enterprise Ireland, through whom State assistance is delivered directly to eligible businesses.  The County and City Enterprise Boards provide support to small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial support in the form of various grants.  In addition the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve the business management capabilities of owner-managers which can assist in the sustainability and growth of their businesses. Enterprise Ireland provides assistance to companies with ten or more employees in the indigenous manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors that wish to expand through increased export activity.  Through its network of 34 overseas offices, Enterprise Ireland assists client companies to create and implement successful strategies for market entry, development and growth.</P>
        <P>Direct mentoring services are amongst the services provided by the County and City Enterprise Boards and Enterprise Ireland but the precise information requested by the Deputy is a day-to-day operational matter for the relevant State Agencies and I would not have any role in gathering or holding such information. Therefore I would suggest that direct contact should be made, in the first instance, with Galway County and City Enterprise Board to explore the provision of mentoring assistance to businesses in the Galway area. The Board can be contacted at Galway County and City Enterprise Board, Wood Quay court, Wood Quay Galway, tel. 091-565384.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 to 161, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Innovation Task Force report starts from the premise that Ireland needs to find new sources of competitive advantage that will provide high quality sustainable jobs and economic growth.  The central premise of the report is a call for a sustained national effort to build a successful innovation ecosystem centred on innovative enterprises and the entrepreneur.  The Report makes a wide range of recommendations in areas such as intellectual property, venture capital, the higher education system, procurement, convergence, sectoral issues, taxation, enterprise agency supports and structures, broadband infrastructure, marketing and implementation.</P>
        <P>The overall importance of the Task Force recommendations is that they constitute a whole of government approach to realising this important strand of our economic recovery.   Given the subject matter of the Task Force Report and the centrality of my Department&rsquo;s role in furthering the objectives of the Smart Economy a very large proportion of the recommendations have been assigned to myself as Minister for ETI and my Department as lead actors for their implementation.</P>
        <P>I have outlined above the sectors comprehended by the recommendations in the Task Force Report.  While the totality of recommendations constitutes a single overarching policy agenda, there is a considerable range among individual recommendations with regard to envisaged timescales and costs, whether recommendations are ongoing or once off and whether the recommendations are new initiatives or build on existing work in progress.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, I have, as a priority, asked my Department to review the current state of play on each of the recommendations for which we have lead responsibility.</P>
        <P>This review will enable us to ascertain those issues where we can move immediately to implementation, where we need to constitute expert working groups as specified by the Task Force and where we need to engage closely with our agencies and other Government Departments to progress implementation.</P>
        <P>Many of the recommendations have significant cost implications, and as such will need to be considered by Government in the context of resource re-prioritisation.  In due course I can bring any such proposals to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Renewal for consideration.</P>
        <P>As with other lead actors the work of my Department and its associated agencies will be presented to the High Level Implementation Committee, whose establishment and oversight <Col N="553"/>role is provided for in the ITF Report.  I propose to discuss with the Taoiseach the optimal organisation and operation of this body.</P>
        <P>Consistent with the focus of the ITF Report the Taoiseach, in his recent Ministerial appointments, made a point of increasing the Government&rsquo;s focus on innovation in both the production and use of ideas, technology and processes.  This is because of the importance of innovation as a key driver of productivity. It is my priority aim as Minister to place innovation at the heart of enterprise policy, and to that end I will ensure efficient and effective follow up on the ITF recommendations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 164 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2007, the objective is to ensure that statutory redundancy payments, due to eligible employees on being made redundant, are made in accordance with the legislative provisions.  The legislation places the onus, in the first instance, on the employer to discharge the obligation to pay redundancy entitlement to employees.  On so doing, the employer is entitled, by virtue of the pay related social contributions made to the State, to recover 60% of the lump sum redundancy payments paid out to employees.</P>
        <P>In the case of liquidations/receiverships, the Department acts in locus of the employer and pays the redundancy lump sums directly to the employees and then seeks to recover from the appointed liquidator/receiver the 40% which the employer would have been due to pay to the employees.</P>
        <P>In instances where the employer does not formally wind the company up but goes into informal insolvency and is unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Department seeks from the employer evidence of inability to pay the entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company&rsquo;s Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.  If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share which the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.  In this instance, the Minister becomes a preferential creditor in a winding-up situation in recovering amounts paid from the Social Insurance Fund and this debt stands against a company for as long as it is live on the Companies Register at the Company Registration Office.</P>
        <P>In instances where the employer is not in a position to provide the documentation as outlined, the Department advises employees to seek to establish their rights and entitlements to Redundancy before the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT).  A positive determination of the EAT enables the Department to pay the redundancy entitlements of the employees directly to them.</P>
        <P>Of course it is the case that company failures are a normal facet of business life and it would be unduly penal if, due to a company failure, all the directors and officers of that company were to be prevented forever more from setting up again.  That is, provided it is clear that their actions resulted from genuine business failure as opposed to acts of recklessness or inappropriate behaviour.</P>
        <P>Under Company law, there are provisions dealing with companies who fail and re-engage in trading under a new name in particular, under the provisions of Part V of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.  Under section 56 of the Act, Liquidators of insolvent companies are required to submit a report to the Director of Corporate Enforcement within 6 months of their appointment.  This report outlines the circumstances of the insolvency and addresses whether the directors acted honestly and responsibly in relation to the conduct of the company&rsquo;s affairs.  Liquidators are further obliged to bring High Court proceedings for the restriction of such directors unless relieved of that obligation by the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>A restriction declaration, if made, prohibits an individual from acting, either directly or indirectly, as an officer of a company or from being involved in its formation or promotion for five years, unless the company is adequately capitalised.</P><Col N="555"/>
        <P>The Director of Corporate Enforcement has the power to bring any other prosecution for breaches of the Companies Acts as deemed appropriate in any individual case.  If the Deputy is aware of any activities in which the Director may have an interest, I would encourage him to have that information forwarded to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>

        <Quest> the length of time taken to process applications for redundancy payments; if measures have been introduced for the purpose of speeding up the process; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</P>
        <P>The impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the level of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department.  This has impacted significantly on the capacity to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge on the Redundancy side is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include: almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents; prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget towards staff in the both Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours; establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments; better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website; and engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  The number of claims processed and paid by the Redundancy Payments Section in 2009 amounted to 50,664, an increase of 70% over 2008.  In the first quarter of 2010, my Department processed 21,122 claims &mdash; an increase of over 151% on the previous first quarter in 2009.  Claims processed in the month of March 2010 was the highest ever achieved in the Section with 8,168 claims processed in the month.  In the year to date, inroads have being made on the backlog of claims on hand, which reduced from 41,168 at the end January 2010 to 37,054 at the end of March 2010.</P>
        <P>The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate applications submitted by post from August 2009 and those filed on-line from September 2009, so that the waiting time is approximately 7 to 8 months depending on the manner of filing the application.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from August 2009.</P><Col N="556"/>
        <P>Responsibility for the payment of redundancy and insolvency payments is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection.  The intention is to transfer by Government order, the payment functions arising under the Redundancy Payment and Insolvency Payment schemes.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to both the Redundancy and Insolvency Payments Schemes on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  As advised in my reply to the Deputy on 17th February 2010, I can confirm <Col N="559"/>that my Department has received claims for the former employees of the company concerned under both Schemes all of which await processing.  </P>
        <P>In relation to the Redundancy Payments Scheme, my Department received six statutory lump sum claims over the period October/November 2009 for the former employees of the company concerned claiming inability to pay the redundancy entitlements on behalf of the employer.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Redundancy Payments Section is now, in general, processing claims dating from August 2009.  In order to be fair to all claimants, claims are processed in order of date of receipt.</P>
        <P>In relation to Insolvency Payments, the current processing time for claims is 14 weeks and, in general, the Insolvency Payments Section is processing claims received in January/February 2010.  In the current case, my Department received applications from the liquidator in respect of holiday Pay for 10 former employees of this company in the period November 2009 to February 2010.  No payment has been made to date as two of the claims remain under query with the liquidator.  Insolvency Payments section will continue to correspond with the liquidator in this case in order to finalise the claims.</P>
        <P>As previously explained, the impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the level of Redundancy and Insolvency Payment claims lodged with my Department.  This is impacting significantly on the capacity to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge on the Redundancy side is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>In the case of Insolvency Payments, the downturn in the economy has resulted in a significant rise in the level of company receiverships and insolvencies.  Consequently, an increasing number of claims are being submitted to the Insolvency Payments Section, with 20,411 new claims received in 2009 &mdash; an increase of 78% over the corresponding period in 2008.  My officials endeavour to process all claims as quickly as possible and claims are dealt with in order of date of receipt. The Section is constantly endeavouring to achieve earlier completion and payment dates.  In the first quarter of 2010 Insolvency Payments Section received on average 2300 new claims per month.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for both Redundancy and Insolvency payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken during 2009 include the deployment of additional resources to those areas and the prioritization of overtime in those areas.</P>
        <P>The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  The number of claims processed and paid by the Redundancy Payments Section in 2009 amounted to 50,664, an increase of 70% over 2008.  In the first quarter of 2010, my Department processed 21,122 claims &mdash; an increase of over 151% on the previous first quarter in 2009.  Claims processed in the month of March 2010 was the highest ever achieved in the Section with 8,168 claims processed in the month.  The number of claims processed and paid by the Insolvency Payments Section in 2009 amounted to 20,172 an increase of 108% over 2008.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the payment of redundancy and insolvency payments is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection.  The intention is to transfer by Government order, the payment functions arising under the Redundancy Payment and Insolvency Payment schemes.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will <Col N="560"/>operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  </P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 23 June 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  I understand that there is an outstanding query in relation to this claim on which my Department has been in contact.  On receipt of a satisfactory response, the Department will be in a position to finalize payment of the claim.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department submitted an application on 19th June 2009 for co-financing assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) towards the cost of guidance, training, entrepreneurship and education programmes for some 2,840 workers made redundant from January 2009 at the Dell computer manufacturing plant in Raheen, Co. Limerick and at ancillary enterprises. It was estimated at that time that up to 2,400 persons would avail of the supported measures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The EGF application in relation to the DELL redundancies was formally approved on 22 December 2009 by the EU budgetary authorities and an EU funds transfer of &euro;14.8m was received in my Department in early March 2010. The Government is providing a matching funding element of &euro;8m within my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  To date a significant number of EGF-eligible former workers or clients have been assisted through the measures including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />over 1,900 former workers have availed of F&Aacute;S occupational guidance services</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />300 persons were trained on F&Aacute;S training courses in 2009;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />200 EGF clients are currently enrolled on F&Aacute;S evening classes;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />over 150 EGF clients have received F&Aacute;S EGF training support grants/reimbursements for private sector training and education courses ;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S has launched a Community based initiative to assist up to 100 EGF clients</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />87 EGF clients are currently on a preparatory training programme in the medical devices sector, with successful candidates progressing into a full EGF internship programme in June 2010;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Over 250 EGF clients are currently registered with Limerick City Adult Education Service</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Some 225 clients currently registered with the City and County Enterprise Boards and are undertaking Start Your Own Business programmes;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Scores of workers are currently attending full and part-time third level educational programmes at University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology etc.</P>
        <P FLI="0">An additional 400 additional F&Aacute;S training places are being made available this year with EGF support and an increase in the number of former workers attending third level and VEC courses is also anticipated.</P>
        <P>Full details of expenditure on the Dell EGF programme to date is being collated by the F&Aacute;S EGF Co-ordination Unit established in Limerick city centre and which is currently liaising with affected workers, statutory bodies and service providers. As the Deputy will be aware I have <Col N="562"/>invited local Mid West Deputies to a detailed briefing, including on expenditure levels, this coming Thursday, as a follow up to an earlier briefing session held with them last month.</P>
        <P>An information event hosted by F&Aacute;S in Raheen on 11 and 12 February 2010 was attended by up to 2,000 former workers and resulted in some 575 expressions of interest in F&Aacute;S training alone. A Steering Committee has been established by F&Aacute;S which includes 6 former workers from Dell and other affected companies, representatives and stakeholders from industry, the educational and entrepreneurial support sectors and relevant State agencies. The Steering Committee met on 13 April 2010 with the view to ensuring inputs are received from and considered by all relevant stakeholders. These fora will help to guide and facilitate the maximisation of Fund resources on the types of supports sought by and appropriate to EGF clients within the parameters of the EGF regulation.</P>
        <P>It is not possible at this juncture to state what the final spend will be at the end of the implementation period. In part, this is dependant on the final uptake by individual EGF clients of certain of the supports being offered and which are a matter of personal choice ultimately. In accordance with the objectives of the EGF, measures are aimed at optimising the potential of the beneficiary client to re-enter the labour market as soon as possible. All measures must be appropriate, transparent and subject to relevant EU and national procurement and control procedures. Funds cannot and will not be expended solely in order to absorb all the money committed by national and EU authorities in a balance sheet type exercise. Rather they will continue to be provided and tailored, where possible, to meet the requirements of the particular cohort of clients eligible under the Fund up to and within the available funding as far as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is making, and will continue to make, every effort to ensure optimum benefit is derived from the funding available and that any potential refund to the Commission at the  completion of the relevant funding period will be minimised. In this context all measures currently in place or planned will be reviewed by my Department in June.</P>

        <P>The Department of An Taoiseach is responsible for coordinating the arrangements in relation to all aspects of our participation in Shanghai.  The overall theme of this Expo is &lsquo;<i>Better City- Better Life&rsquo;</i>, and therefore is likely to appeal to a more general audience. However, my Department and the development agencies have engaged with the Department of An Taoiseach to ensure that any opportunities for any potential trade or investment benefits for Ireland, which could flow from our involvement in the Expo, will be pursued.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department received three rebate claims in respect of former employees of the company concerned.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that in relation to two of the three claims, they have recently been processed and authorized for payment.  Payment will issue to the employer concerned over the next one to two week period.  In relation to the third claim, a query has arisen in relation to eligibility in terms of whether the individual was in insurable employment at the time of termination of the employment.  This issue is being pursued with the Department of Social and Family Affairs but the claim cannot be further progressed until this issue is resolved.</P>

	<P>Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief at the standard rate of income tax (20%) in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual in respect of a third level education course.  Qualifying fees means tuition fees paid in respect of an approved course at an approved college.  The maximum annual limit on which tax relief can be claimed is &euro;5,000 @ 20% (standard rate) per course.  The tax <Col N="565"/>relief is confined to tuition fees only and does not extend to items such as registration fees, administration fees, accommodation, etc.  Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, employer contribution or other means are to be deducted in arriving at the net fees qualifying for tax relief.  </P>
        <P>An approved course means either,</P>
<P el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>a full-time or part-time undergraduate course of study of at least 2 academic years&rsquo; duration at an approved college; or</P>
<P el="5">(b) <?oasys _ix ?>a postgraduate course of study leading to a postgraduate award, based on a thesis or on the results of an examination or both, in an approved college&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />of not less than one academic year, but not more than 4 academic years, in duration,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />that requires an individual, undertaking the course, to have been conferred with a degree or an equivalent qualification</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As regards an approved college, the school referred to in the details supplied would qualify as an approved college for the purposes of the scheme if it is a university or similar institution of higher education in a Member State of the European Union (other than in the State) which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds of that country or is a duly accredited university or institution of higher education in the country in which it is situated.</P>
        <P>In practice, it is a matter for the individual claiming the tax relief to obtain a letter from the relevant university or similar institute of higher education in that other EU Member State confirming that it is a university or similar institution of higher education in a Member State of the European Union (other than in the State) which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds of that country or is a duly accredited university or institution of higher education in the country in which it is situated.</P>
        <P>If such a letter is obtained and the claimant is satisfied that the course then falls within the definition of &lsquo;an approved course&rsquo;, then the matter can be referred again to the relevant Revenue office that dealt with the claim initially for that office to re-examine claim for relief.</P>

	<P>The National Lottery Act 1986 provided for the establishment of the National Lottery. The National Lottery Company was incorporated in September 1986 and commenced trading in March 1987.  Section 5 of the National Lottery Act 1986 provided that the surplus from the National Lottery may be used for the following purposes: Sport and other recreation; national culture, including the Irish Language; the arts, within the meaning of the Arts Act 1951; the health of the community; and for such other purposes as the Government may determine. The following additional categories have been so determined: youth, welfare, national heritage and amenities. </P>
        <P>In order to give effect to this statutory provision, the surplus from the National Lottery is transferred to the Exchequer on a regular basis and is applied each year to part-fund the Exchequer allocations to a specified range of expenditure subheads across various Votes. Details of the amounts transferred and the allocations to the relevant subheads are set out each year in Appendix 1 of the Revised Estimates for Public Services.</P><Col N="566"/>
        <P>In 2008, the amount of National Lottery surplus available and applied to these subheads was &euro;265m (of which &euro;6.42m was carried over from the previous year) and in 2009 the amount was &euro;275m.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have an obligation to address the question of the proper use and management of resources, particularly in the current economic circumstances.  In this context and following an efficiency review of smaller offices, the Vehicle Registration Office (VRO) for Co. Donegal was relocated to Donegal Town in February 2009.  The Revenue office in Donegal Town was selected for the location of the VRO as best use could be made of the available staff resources and the existing office accommodation.  Parking for vehicles and customers is also well catered for at that location.  The Letterkenny and Bridgend locations were both considered unsuitable for VRO purposes for various reasons, including availability of staff, office space and adequate parking facilities. The Donegal Town location represents the best use of available resources by Revenue and meets the requirements for the provision of customer service in the county in regard to vehicle registration. </P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s on-line facility (ROS) has greatly reduced the demand for service at Vehicle Registration Offices. All new vehicles can be registered using ROS. Indeed, each of the main dealers in Co. Donegal currently uses ROS for this purpose and no attendance at a VRO is necessary.  Plans to appoint  the National Car Testing Service (NCTS) to carry out a range of registration functions on behalf of Revenue  are at an advanced stage.  Following appointment, it is anticipated that the NCTS shall provide vehicle registration facilities at their newly opened NCT Centre in Carndonagh.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, based on service demands, the readily-accessible alternatives available and the need for Revenue to make effective use of resources, the consolidation of vehicle registration services into Donegal Town is reasonable.</P>

	<P>The State Claims Agency has informed me that the State Claims Agency (SCA), the name used by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) when carrying out its claims and associated risk management functions, is not subject to the moratorium on public sector recruitment.  The moratorium does not apply to the NTMA on account of the delegation to it of multiple, additional functions.  The SCA is currently recruiting two claims managers to augment its existing claims team concerning the management of the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s employers, public and motor liability claims which were formally delegated to the Agency by the National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Functions) Order 2009.</P>

   <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />More widespread use of SCA risk management services by Departments generally.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The SCA is currently seeking to recruit additional solicitors to augment its existing in-house litigation team.  The Agency has agreed a schedule of fixed fees in relation to its external panel of defence solicitors and has agreed new fee structures with barristers retained by it in the defence of claims.  The Agency is represented on the Medical Negligence Working Group, chaired by Mr Justice Quirke, High Court Judge.  The Group has set as its task the provision of such draft legislation, regulations or rules of court as may be necessary to give effect to the <Col N="569"/>Group&rsquo;s recommendations regarding Periodic Payment Orders, such drafts to be provided on or by 30 November 2010.</P>

	<P>Co-habitating couples are expressly recognised for the purpose of social welfare law but are not recognised for the purposes of income tax law. Although this may appear contradictory, the main aim of both the welfare code and the <Col N="570"/>tax code is to uphold the constitutional right of married couples not to be treated less favourably than unmarried couples.</P>
        <P>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income. The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</P>
        <P>In the particular circumstances outlined, where a couple are cohabiting rather than married, it is not permitted under existing legislation to transfer tax credits between the individuals.</P>

	<P>There is no general requirement that companies applying for public contracts provide three year financial statements of accounts. Under public procurement guidelines, contracting authorities are required to ensure that recently established firms, or firms with no previous experience of public contracts, are not excluded from public tendering. It is, of course, essential that contractors performing public contracts be of sufficiently sound economic and financial standing. The general position is that criteria used to determine the appropriate level of financial capacity must be proportionate and relevant to the needs of the particular contract. Various forms of evidence of financial capacity may be sought, such as bankers&rsquo; statements, extracts from balance sheets, proof of access to professional indemnity, public liability and employer liability insurance, performance bonds or demonstrable access to resources of third parties.  </P>

	<P>Information such as the composition or breakdown by financial turnover of companies awarded public contracts is not sought or maintained centrally. Contracts advertised in the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU) will generally indicate if it is intended that the contract will be awarded in lots. Subsequent to award, certain information on individual contracts advertised on the OJEU is published in the Official Journal and on the national public procurement website www.etenders.gov.ie under a &ldquo;Contract Award Notice&rdquo;. This notice normally includes the name and address of the successful tenderer or tenderers, the price or range of prices tendered (subject to considerations such as commercial <Col N="571"/>sensitivity or not compromising competition), if the contract is to awarded in lots and the winning tenderers for such lots and if any element of the contract is to be sub-contracted.</P>

        <P>A number of representations have been made in relation to the application of the pay reductions to contract researchers. The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No 2) Act, 2009 makes provision for the reduction in the pay rates of all persons employed by public service bodies with effect from 1 January 2010. As universities come within the definition in the Act of public service bodies, contract researchers employed by such universities are subject to the pay reductions provided for under the legislation.

	<P>This is a matter in the first instance for the Revenue Commissioners who are charged with responsibility for the timely collection and recovery of taxes and duties due to the Exchequer. I know that Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their responsibilities to pay the right amount of tax and on time. Revenue expects businesses to continue, notwithstanding the more difficult economic circumstances in which they are operating at present, to maintain and organise their financial affairs in such a fashion as to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due. I fully support what Revenue are doing in that regard. </P>
        <P>I know that Revenue appreciates the challenge for business in being timely compliant in the current difficult economic and financial climate. Revenue has consistently encouraged businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise to find an agreed way through those difficulties and quickly restore voluntary timely compliance. Revenue has developed an administrative framework to manage such cases, and has published material for businesses experiencing tax payment difficulties on its website <i>www.revenue.ie. </i>Revenue has done very good work in the practical support and assistance it is providing to viable businesses. I am aware that tax practitioners and representative bodies have recognised the Revenue efforts in this regard.</P>
        <P>Where businesses or individuals experience difficulties in meeting their tax payment obligations on time, then unless there is meaningful and timely engagement with Revenue and agreement on how that challenge will be managed, Revenue will take the necessary action, including enforcement, to secure compliance. That action is taken to secure the monies due to the Exchequer and to ensure a level playing field between those who meet their obligations on time and those who pay late or perhaps, if possible, not at all.  Those businesses and individuals who comply on a voluntary and timely basis must be confident that their efforts are recognised <Col N="572"/>through the initiation of the necessary collection and recovery action by Revenue against those who do not meet their obligations.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, he may wish to contact the Revenue Commissioners with the details.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 and 206 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Report of the Innovation Taskforce was launched in the Science Gallery, Trinity College on 11th March.  The Report which provides a roadmap for one of the five Action Areas in the Smart Economy Framework and complements the progress which has already been made on other aspects of the strategy set out in the Framework.  Specifically, it endorses the Government&rsquo;s vision for Ireland as a Global Innovation Hub and suggests that we have the potential to achieve this goal.  The Report has made a wide range of recom<Col N="573"/>mendations, some involving new initiatives, while others call for a reinforcement and better alignment of existing efforts and programmes.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Government will shortly announce the establishment of a High Level Implementation Committee to consider and oversee the implementation of the Taskforce&rsquo;s Report. This Committee will reflect the recent changes in Departmental structures and responsibilities which will be supportive in progressing the Taskforce&rsquo;s recommendations.  This implementation process will also need to take account of resources and other constraints facing the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to the recommendation that the competitiveness of our tax offering to mobile Intellectual Property-rich businesses should be urgently reviewed in conjunction with relevant industry representatives, the Deputy should note that I introduced a new scheme of tax relief for expenditure on intangible assets (which is also denoted as Intellectual Property) in the Finance Act 2009.</P>
        <P>Under the scheme, relief in the form of capital allowances against trading income is provided in respect of capital expenditure incurred by companies on the provision of intangible assets for the purposes of a trade.  The scheme applies to a broad range of intangible assets &mdash; either externally acquired or internally developed &mdash; which are recognised as such under generally accepted accounting practice and which are listed in the legislation giving effect to the scheme<b>.  </b>This is an important new incentive aimed at supporting the development of the knowledge economy and the provision of high quality employment.  Intellectual property has become a key source of competitive advantage for business in the global economy and this is now recognised in our tax system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Notwithstanding that the scheme was only introduced last year, I made further improvements to it in the recently enacted Finance Act 2010, specifically section 43 of that legislation.  Most of these changes were made after consideration of views provided by industry interests on the scheme.  While I will continue to review the scheme and consider the views of industry on its operation and scope, we have to be careful about any suggested move away from our single 12.5% rate on trading profits which has served Ireland well to date and which might be involved in the &ldquo;Innovation Box&rdquo; approach referred to in the Taskforce Report.</P>
        <P>The Taskforce Report also includes a recommendation that the incremental spend requirement of the Research and Development (R&amp;D) tax credit scheme should be removed entirely, making the scheme volume-based in terms of rewarding R&amp;D expenditure.  The scheme was introduced in 2004 and provides for a tax credit of 25% of the increase in expenditure incurred by a company on R&amp;D as compared to its expenditure in a base year which is 2003.  The purpose of the scheme is to encourage additional or incremental R&amp;D spend by companies.  For companies who commenced to incur expenditure on R&amp;D after 2003, the base year expenditure is nil and all of its R&amp;D expenditure will qualify for the 25% credit.</P>
        <P>The Taskforce&rsquo;s recommendation in this area would involve an additional &ldquo;deadweight&rdquo; cost to the Exchequer in respect of R&amp;D expenditure that had been incurred without the need for a fiscal stimulus (a fact acknowledged in the Report).  Complying with this recommendation would represent poor value for public expenditure, particularly in the current economic environment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The R&amp;D tax credit scheme has been improved in most Budgets and Finance Acts since its introduction and the significant enhancements introduced in Budget 2009 and Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 will act to make the scheme one of the most competitive of its kind anywhere. The changes introduced in Budget 2009 and Finance (No.2) Act 2008 included: An increase in the rate of tax credit from 20% to 25%; An option to carry-back unused tax credits for set-off <Col N="574"/>against  a company&rsquo;s previous year&rsquo;s corporation tax payments, if there is insufficient corporate tax liability in the current year, thereby creating a tax refund; and a further option, if unused tax credits still remain, to claim payment of the remaining unused credits which will be paid in instalments over a 3 year period. The permanent setting of 2003 as the base expenditure year under the scheme means that the scheme  will, in effect, become volume-based over time as occurred, for example, in the US.</P>

This implementation process will also need to take account of resources and other constraints facing the Government.</P>
        <P>In Finance Act 2010, which was signed by the President on 3 April, an existing scheme to attract highly-skilled individuals was significantly enhanced to improve its effectiveness.  Initially, in Finance (No. 2) Act 2008, the scheme was aimed at attracting highly-skilled individuals to Ireland who could, in turn, act as &ldquo;magnets&rdquo; to attract further economic activity and employment.  This was done by deeming the tax liability of such individuals on the foreign employment income to be limited to the greater of (a) the amount of the income from the employment remitted to the State, or (b) &euro;100,000 plus 50% of the income over that amount.  The recent changes to the scheme widened its application from non-European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement countries, with which Ireland has a Double Taxation Agreement, to include EU and EEA nationals (other than Irish domiciled individuals) who come to live and work here.  In addition, the period for which a beneficiary of the scheme must remain working in Ireland in order to benefit from the relief has been reduced from three years to one year.</P>

	<P>The details of the number of reams of A4 and A3 paper purchased in the period 2006 to date in 2010 are not readily available. However the table below lists the amount spent on A4 and A3 paper which is used for printers, fax and photocopier machines. Currently my Department does not use recycled paper for these machines, as it is not economically advantageous to do so. All of the reams of photocopier and  printer paper currently  in use by my Department  are produced from elementally chlorine-free (EFC) pulps from fully sustainable sources.</P>

	<P>In Budget 2010, I announced that I was taking steps to avoid an unmanageable increase in the number of retirements this year.  Accordingly, the legislation on pay reductions &mdash; the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest [No 2] Act 2009 &mdash; stipulated that any retirements in 2010 would be on the basis of the pre-cut pay terms to avoid a large and increase in the number of retirements before the end of last year. The statute gives me powers to extend the period by statutory instrument.</P>
        <P>This issue has also been considered as part of the present discussions with the public service unions on a new national pay framework. The draft <i>Public Service Agreement 2010-14</i> states that &ldquo;There will be an extension of the period by a year within which the 2010 pay reductions will be disregarded for the purposes of calculating Public Service pension entitlements.&rdquo;</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> his plans to increase or change betting tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I have stated previously, it is my intention to widen, if possible, the tax base on which betting duty would be applied.</P>
        <P>Bets placed either online or over the phone are generally with out-of-State companies so applying betting duty is therefore problematic.  My officials, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are looking at the scope to overcome legal and operational difficulties in this area and will continue to do so, on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is working closely with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has initiated a review in order to provide the Government with options for a new and comprehensive legal and organisational framework governing gambling architecture in the State. The review, amongst other things, will consider: the recommendations contained in the Report Regulating Gaming in Ireland, the existing law regulating gaming lotteries and other forms of gambling in the jurisdiction, international developments, in particular the experience of the UK&rsquo;s Gambling Commission, developments in relation to remote gambling (e.g. via the internet and mobile phones).</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, due to pressure on the betting sector, I decided to defer the introduction of the increase in the betting duty provided for in Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 pending a review. Accordingly, the Finance Act 2009 contains a provision for continuing the existing betting duty rate of 1% unless and until an order is made bringing the 2% rate into effect, or alternative betting  taxation arrangements are enacted. This decision is based on the premise that the betting sector will engage in constructive discussions about putting in place a fair and workable tax base for the sector.  Such discussions will, inter alia, touch on issues such as online/phone betting, which is largely untaxed, and look at proposals that could potentially bring this area into the tax net, if possible, while also protecting Irish employment in the sector.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There were no representations from the Bank referred to by the Deputy.  The Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 was <Col N="584"/>approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 17th October 2008 following the receipt of EU State aid approval for the introduction of the scheme.  On the basis of the advice of the Governor of the Central Bank the institution referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question was one of a number of institutions specified in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) (Specification of Institutions) Order 2008 as requiring financial support in accordance with the objectives of the Credit Institutions Financial Support Act, 2008.   </P>
        <P>The Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Commission have both specifically acknowledged the systemic importance of this institution and the new Financial Regulator has recently said that he believes this institution was of systemic importance at the time the guarantee was introduced.   The Deputy may wish to note that excluding any systemic institution from the scope of the guarantee would have undermined the stability of the entire financial system at a time of unprecedented turmoil across the whole of the global financial system and intense pressures on the liquidity position of the whole banking system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the rules on when a person is a &ldquo;chargeable person&rdquo; for the purposes of the self-assessment system, and is liable to make a return under that system rather than under the PAYE system, were amended in Finance Act 2005. These rules were further clarified in Tax Briefing No. 62 which is available on the Revenue website at the following link:</P>
<P FLI="0" el="0"><i>http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/tax-briefing/62/tb05.htm</i></P>
        <P Just="Left">In summary, an individual who is in receipt of income chargeable to tax under the PAYE system but who is also in receipt of income from non-PAYE sources will not be regarded as a &ldquo;chargeable person&rdquo; if the total gross income from all non-PAYE sources is less than &euro;50,000, the net assessable income (e.g. after allowable deductions) is less than &euro;3,174, and the non-PAYE income is coded against PAYE tax credits.</P>
        <P>An individual who is in receipt of income chargeable to tax under the PAYE system but whose gross income from non-PAYE sources is &euro;50,000 or more will always be regarded as a &ldquo;chargeable person&rdquo; for the purposes of the self-assessment system. This rule applies even if the net amount of the non-PAYE income is less than &euro;3,174 or even if it is Nil.</P>
        <P>These rules apply regardless of the country in which the non-PAYE income arises.</P>
        <P>Where a person is a &ldquo;chargeable person&rdquo; for the purposes of the self-assessment system then the person must make a self-assessment tax return.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the tax revenue collected from the income levy in 2009 and its projected revenue in 2010; the way this revenue is split between the three different rates at which the income levy is collected, for both 2009 and 2010. </Quest>
        <QRef>[15260/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of the Income Levy was announced in Budget 2009 and it took effect in January 2009. The rates at which the Levy is charged were increased in the Supplementary Budget of April 2009.</P><Col N="585"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Income Levy is collected by the Revenue Commissioners as a component of Income Tax.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is estimated that &euro;1.1 billion was collected from the Income Levy in 2009. In Budget 2010, it was forecast that Income Tax receipts of &euro;11,530 million would be collected in 2010 and it is expected that the yield from the Income Levy will account for about &euro;1.5 billion of the overall amount forecast for Income Tax.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Income Levy is collected as a component of Income Tax, the breakdown between the two must be estimated until such a time as the final tax returns for 2009 are received and processed. Self-employed Income Tax returns for 2009 are not due to be submitted until October of this year. Consequently, it is not possible to provide an exact breakdown of the Income Levy on a rate by rate basis at this time. However, on the basis of indicative information from Revenue, it is expected that almost three quarters of the estimated Income Levy yield will arise from the lowest rate, which was the composite rate of 1.67% for 2009 and the 2% rate for 2010. The top composite rate in 2009 was 5% and it is estimated that 12% of the yield was paid at this rate. The top rate for this tax year is 6% and it is expected that about 15.5% of the overall yield will come from those paying at this rate.</P>
        <P>Finally, it must be stressed that the figures for both 2009 and 2010 are estimates and as such subject to revision at a later stage.</P>

	<P>It is not the practice of the National Procurement Service to visit all candidates or tenderers in tender competitions.  Following the evaluation of tenders received in a competition, it is sometimes necessary to verify, by way of a site visit, that the lead tenderer has the necessary equipment, skill personnel and capacity to satisfactorily perform the contract.  On this basis, a visit was made to the company who had submitted the lead tender in this case, and it was decided to award the contract to that company.</P>
        <P>None of the travel or accommodation expenses incurred in this visit were paid by the company.  The total cost of the visit incurred by the National Procurement Service amounted to &euro;621.32 including flights, travel and subsistence.  A representative of the Revenue Commissioners also attended the facility and would have incurred similar costs.</P>

	<P>The provisions of section 128 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 govern the taxation of share options.  Under these provisions a charge to income tax under Schedule E arises on gains realised by directors or employees from the exercise, assignment or release of rights, which are granted to them by reason of their office or employment, to acquire shares or other assets in a company.  In the case of share options, the income tax charge arising on the exercise of an option is calculated by reference to the difference between:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the market value of the shares on the date the director or employee exercises the option (and acquires the shares), and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the aggregate of the price paid by the director or employee for the shares and the amount (if any) paid for the option.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Where options are assigned or released, the income tax charge is calculated by reference to the consideration received by the director or employee on the assignment or release, less the amount (if any) paid for the option.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 128 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 was amended in the Finance Act 2005 in relation to share options acquired by individuals who were non-resident at the time the options are granted.</P>
        <P>Section 16 of the Finance Act 2005 extended the income tax charge to individuals who, at the time of the granting of the share option&mdash;</P>
<P el="5">(a) were not resident in Ireland for tax purposes; and</P>
<P el="5">(b) whose income was not within the charge to Irish tax.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The amendment applies to shares options granted on or after 5 April 2007.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of the amendment was to tax the gains arising from share options attributable to a period of the duties of an office or employment exercised in Ireland where the share option was granted prior to the individual coming to the Ireland.</P>
        <P>The amendment came about as a result of an OECD recommendation that countries should adopt a common approach in applying their double taxation treaties in relation to issues arising from the use of share options as part of employee remuneration packages.  Depending on the timing of taxation by individual countries, for example, by reference to receipt of the option or exercise of the option, the then existing treatment could have resulted in either double taxation or double non-taxation.</P><Col N="587"/>
        <P>There was also an amendment made in section 15 of the Finance Act 2006 concerning the remittance basis of taxation, which may indirectly affect the taxation of share options.</P>
        <P>Finally, in relation to share options acquired under a Revenue approved Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (SAYE Scheme), Section 13(1)(a) of the Finance Act 2008 increased the maximum monthly amount of savings that can be used for the purposes of such a scheme from &euro;320 to &euro;500.</P>

	<P>The concerns outlined in the correspondence enclosed by the Deputy refer to the need to update legislation governing the operation and regulation of credit unions in Ireland and to the proposal to amend Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 which imposes limits on credit unions in relation to longer-term lending.</P>
        <P>With reference to credit union legislation,<b> </b>I agree that the current legislative framework needs reform.  Accordingly, I have requested the Financial Regulator to initiate a strategic review of the credit union sector in Ireland.  This project, which is already underway, will involve an examination of the structure, operation, regulation and legislation of the credit union sector.  It will provide a report making recommendations, including specific proposals to strengthen prudential soundness, which will advise and inform an assessment of the future strategic direction of credit unions.</P>
        <P>The restrictions contained in Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 are an important asset and liability instrument protecting the financial stability of the credit union movement over many years.  The need for such a mechanism will be addressed in the strategic review but in the immediate future it is necessary to address ongoing issues with regard to Section 35 now.  The matter was considered by my Department following consultation with the two Credit Union representative bodies &mdash; the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Credit Union Development Association &mdash; and with the Registrar of Credit Unions, and a provision has been included in the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 which was read for the second time in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann this afternoon.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 229, 285, 306, 316 and 407 together.</P>
        <P>I have decided to introduce a system of reference pricing combined with generic substitution under the GMS and community drugs schemes. This will promote price competition and deliver ongoing savings for both the State and for patients.</P>
        <P>A working group, made up of officials and healthcare professionals from my Department and the HSE, is setting out proposed steps for implementing this initiative. I expect to see significant progress on this in 2010, including the identification of legislative and administrative changes required to give it effect in 2011.</P>
        <P>There are currently 12 products containing the active ingredient alendronic acid reimbursed under the GMS and community drugs schemes. All of these products have received marketing authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board. All medicinal products (whether originator or generic) authorised for placing on the Irish market are subject to the same requirements of quality, safety and efficacy.</P>
        <P>There are some categories of medicines that are not suitable for substitution. In addition, there are also certain circumstances where an individual patient should receive a particular product. With a system of generic substitution it is important that all decisions about the interchangeability of medicines are evidence-based and take into account best practice elsewhere. It is envisaged that an expert group would provide guidance on this matter.</P>
        <P>The joint Department/HSE working group has consulted with a wide range of stakeholders over the past number of months. The Irish Osteoporosis Society has brought to the group&rsquo;s attention research in relation to alendronic acid. This will be taken into account when the list of interchangeable medicines is being drawn up.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Evidence from other countries (UK and Australia) has shown that the highest uptake rates are achieved when HPV vaccine is administered in schools (3rd dose uptakes of over 80% versus less than 65% for GP administration). The safety and efficacy of the vaccine was extensively studied in clinical trials before licensing. HSE school based vaccination teams currently administer vaccinations to around 100,000 children each year and are well practised in dealing with possible reactions. Vaccinations are given by nurses under medication protocol with medical support on site. However, as with all vaccines and medicines used in Ireland, the Irish Medicines Board will continue to monitor the safety of Gardasil vaccine during routine use. The Irish Medicines Board is supported in this surveillance through collaboration with EU counterparts. I am satisfied in all the circumstances, that when possible, the policy of delivering the vaccination programme mainly in school settings is the most appropriate one.</P>

In January of this year, I announced the commencement of a national public HPV vaccination programme for girls who are currently in first year in secondary school. This will involve the free vaccination of up to 30,000 girls mainly in school settings and an announcement of the details of the full programme involved will be made by the HSE in the near future. The programme will continue with vaccine being offered to all girls in first year in secondary school each year. It is not proposed to extend the public vaccination programme beyond that. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 246 and 248 together.  </P>
        <P>Section 45 of the Child Care Act, 1991 provides for the provision of aftercare services. The Ryan report implementation plan states that &ldquo;The provision of aftercare by the HSE should form an integral part of care delivery for children who have been in the care of the State. It should not be seen as a discretionary service or as a once-off event that occurs on a young person&rsquo;s 18th birthday.</P>
        <P>The implementation plan also makes a number of recommendations in respect of aftercare and states the HSE &ldquo;will ensure the provision of aftercare services for children leaving care in all instances where the professional judgment of the allocated social worker determines it is required&rdquo;.  In his Budget Statement in December the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced, as part of the funding related to the Ryan report implementation plan, that an additional &euro;1 million would be set aside for aftercare in 2010. That is a mark of the Government&rsquo;s commitment.  In relation to the existing legislative framework, my Office is currently undertaking a review which includes consideration of legal advice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the National Review of Sexual Assault Treatment Services is ongoing but essentially complete.  Currently there are 6 Sexual Assault Treatment Units (SATUs) located around the country &mdash; all of which strive to provide a 24 hour a day service, 7 days a week.  The units are located at The Rotunda Hospital (Dublin), South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital (Cork), Waterford Regional Hospital, Midlands Hospital (Mullingar), Galway and Letterkenny.  Due to infrastruc<Col N="596"/>tural constraints, which have on occasion limited their ability to offer a 24/7 service, alternative ring-fenced accommodations have been sourced for the units in Mullingar and Letterkenny to place them in a better position to provide care for patients around the clock.</P>
        <P>On 20th April 2009, I presented certificates to the first group of clinical nurse/midwife specialists who completed the Higher Diploma in Nursing &mdash; Sexual Assault Forensic Nursing Examination in the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland.  This course equips the participant with the knowledge, skills and competence to carry out forensic clinical examinations in a systematic objective manner, whilst caring for the victim, and recognising potential physical and psychological trauma.  The nurses are now working in their sponsoring SATUs providing holistic care to the victims of sexual assault.  As well as undertaking clinical and forensic examination of men and women who are engaging with the criminal justice system, these nurses also provide care for people who choose not to report an incident to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Care for such people is internationally recognised to be beneficial in order to reduce the immediate and long-term effects of assault but the limited SATU services in Ireland had been unable to offer such support prior to 2009.   The training and appointment of these nurses/midwives has had an immensely positive impact on provision of SATU services around the country.</P>
        <P>Plans are well advanced to run a further higher diploma programme in September 2010 to increase the number of nurses available to provide holistic care and undertake clinical forensic examination of victims of sexual assault.  Funding for the academic costs of a further Higher Diploma Course has just been approved, and the funding stream for additional costs is currently being clarified.</P>
        <P>A revision of the 2006 <i>Rape/Sexual Assault &mdash; National Guidelines on Referral and Forensic Clinical Examination</i> is currently underway, as mandated in the National Review.  The revised interagency guidelines will be available by mid 2010 and will be distributed to all relevant stakeholders.  These revised guidelines will mirror the developments and improvements that have taken place in this sector in the intervening years, such as the provision of services for non-reporting clients and the inclusion of preventative care, for example in relation to sexually transmitted infections, in the treatment available to clients.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill 2010 was published on 19th January 2010. It has two main purposes: to update our laws on the taking of samples from suspects for use in evidence, and to provide for the establishment of a DNA Database System for use by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an intelligence source for criminal investigations and also to assist in finding missing persons and identifying unknown persons including human remains.  The Bill is awaiting Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>It provides that most persons detained in connection with a serious offence (generally an offence punishable by imprisonment of 5 years or more) will be required to provide a sample for the purposes of the DNA Database System.  It also provides that: offenders subject to a sentence of imprisonment at the time of commencement for a serious offence (irrespective of whether the offender is in prison or on temporary release), and all offenders subject to the notification requirement in the Sex Offenders Act 2001 at the time of commencement will be required to provide a sample for the DNA Database.  DNA profiles relating to offenders will be retained on the Database indefinitely.</P>

	<P>A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Task Force was established in February 2006 following the presentation of the report <b><i>Children&rsquo;s Health First-International best practice in tertiary paediatric services: implications for the strategic organisation of tertiary paediatric services in Ireland</i></b> to advise on the optimum location of the proposed new paediatric hospital. The Task Group also included representation from the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>This Task Group considered submissions from a number of hospitals in the greater Dublin area, from private hospitals, property developers and site owners and engaged in extensive consultations with the three existing paediatric hospitals, the maternity hospitals and external experts. The location of the new children&rsquo;s hospital was selected prior to the decision on the precise route of the Metro North line. However, the subsequent decision to proceed with the Metro North project and to locate a Metro stop at the Mater campus with an entrance / exit to Eccles Street will assist with access to the new children&rsquo;s hospital.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to note that planning of the new hospital is proceeding on schedule, and that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the HSE are making very good progress in their work to bring this important project to fruition. Construction work is due to commence later this year, and the Hospital is on target to open at the end of 2014.</P>

This application will be processed in accordance with Dublin City Council&rsquo;s planning application process, including public access to submitted information and design plans.</P>
        <P>In relation to the public consultation, the NPHDB has commenced a consultation process with children and young people. They held two consultation days in December 2009 on the hospital plans and designs. They have established a Youth Advisory Panel, consisting of young people from 13 &mdash; 16 years old who have experience of hospitalisations. The Panel has had a meeting with the designers on the hospital plans.  The NPHDB is planning a Family Forum, made up of parents / guardians of children in hospital, to involve them in the hospital design. The NPHDB also has regular meetings with the residents around the hospital site.</P>

	<P>As an obstetric procedure, Symphysiotomy is a matter primarily for the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to advise and lead upon.  Accordingly, I have asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to prepare a report for me concerning the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland. I have asked that the report would: provide the Institute&rsquo;s assessment of the circumstances in which symphysiotomy was carried out in Irish obstetric units; indicate what protocols or guidance existed over the years to guide professional practice; and specify when the practice changed and why it changed at that time in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am also committed to ensuring that the greatest possible support and services are made available to women who continue to suffer effects of having undergone this procedure. The women concerned continue to receive attention and care through a number of services which have been put in place including: the provision of medical cards to all Survivors of Symphysiotomy (SOS) patients who requested them, the nomination, since 2003, of a Liaison Officer for a patients&rsquo; group comprised of women who underwent a symphysiotomy procedure, the availability of independent clinical advice for former patients by Liaison Officers who assist in co-ordinating the provision of services to those patients,  the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up, including Medical Assessment, Gynaecology Assessment, Orthopaedic Assessment, Counselling, Physiotherapy, Reflexology, Home Help, Acupuncture, Osteopathy and fast tracked hospital appointments.  I understand that to date, 125 women have availed of some or all of the services offered by the HSE, including the refund of medical expenses related to symphysiotomy in respect of medication/private treatments, the establishment of a triple assessment service for patients at Cappagh Hospital, Dublin in January 2005, and a Support Group facilitated by a counsellor which was set up in 2004 in Dundalk and Drogheda for women living in North East region.</P>
        <P>I have been assured by the HSE that it will continue to monitor and oversee the provision of necessary support services for women.  In doing so the HSE is committed to being proactive in seeking out and offering help to women who had symphysiotomies and who may wish to avail of the services offered by the HSE.</P>

	<P>I have responsibility for implementation of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which was introduced in January of this year. Children will qualify for a free pre-school year place when they are aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September each year.  The application of this age range is being interpreted as generously as possible to include children who are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September each year.   The upper age limit does not apply where children are developmentally delayed and would benefit from participating in the pre-school year at a later age or where the enrolment policy of the local schools prevents a child from availing of age-appropriate education.</P>
        <P>The objective of the ECCE scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to children in the year before they commence primary school. To achieve this, services participating in the pre-school year will be expected to provide appropriate age related activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort. Targeting the pre-school year at a particular age cohort is clearly fundamental to the scheme and it is necessary, therefore, to set minimum and maximum limits to the age within which children will participate in the scheme each year.  To extend the age limits in which children will qualify for the scheme would undermine the ability of services to provide appropriate age-related activities to children in the pre-school year.</P>
        <P>In setting the minimum and maximum age limits, account is taken of a number of factors, including the fact that the majority of children commence primary school between the ages of 4 years and 6 month and 5 years and 6 months. The qualifying age range for the ECCE scheme extends to more than 15 months and requires the amount of funding which is allocated to the scheme to be higher than would be the case if a stricter time frame was imposed. Despite current budgetary constraints, this more generous approach has been adopted and the higher allocation of funding has been made.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the age range set for the scheme achieves a reasonable balance between supporting the provision of appropriate age related programmes and activities and providing flexibility to parents and their children and there are no plans to review the position in this regard at this stage.</P>

	<P>Ireland operates a bilateral healthcare reimbursement agreement with the United Kingdom comprehending such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries; pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country; and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country.  Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.   The payment made in any one year is determined based upon an estimate of the number of persons falling within categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  The amount payable is agreed following compilation of the necessary data and discussions between the two administrations.  Total payments in any one year can relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years&rsquo; liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current year.  The net payment received from the UK over the last five years is as follows: 2005 &mdash; &euro;448.6 million; 2006 &mdash; &euro;396.7 million; 2007 &mdash; &euro;450 million; 2008 &mdash; &euro;100 million; 2009 &mdash; &euro;286.6 million.  An amount of &euro;285 million is estimated for 2010.  An amount of &euro;50 million has been received to date in 2010.</P>

	<P>Sativex is a derivative of cannabis. Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, the manufacture, production, preparation, sale, supply, distribution and possession of derivatives of cannabis is unlawful except for the purposes of research.  I am aware that claims have been made in respect of possible benefits of cannabis and products containing cannabis for patients suffering from certain conditions such as multiple sclerosis. However, it is not lawful for cannabis, products containing cannabis or derivatives <Col N="602"/>thereof to be authorised for medicinal use in Ireland, even if legally prescribed in another EU State. I have no plans to change the law in this regard. </P>

	<P>Ireland has a comprehensive mental health policy framework in place which outlines a set of values and principles that will guide both Government and service providers as we proceed to develop and put in place a modern high- quality mental health service.  This policy document &lsquo;<i>A Vision for Change&rsquo; </i>proposes a holistic view of mental illness and recommends an integrated multidisciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems.  It recommends a person centred treatment approach which addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice and most importantly evolved and agreed with both service users and their carers.</P><Col N="605"/>
        <P>In January 2008, the Government established the Office for Disability and Mental Health as a cross-cutting Government Office with a remit across the then four Government Departments: Health and Children, Education and Skills, Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and Justice and Law Reform.  The Office provides for greater cohesion across the public service and brings together responsibility for a range of different policy areas and State services.  The Office was assigned four key priorities one of which is to bring  a new impetus to the implementation of &lsquo;<i>A Vision for Change&rsquo;</i> working in partnership with the HSE and other stakeholders including other Government Departments to achieve implementation of agreed targets.  Bilateral meetings with officials from other Government Departments to discuss progressing recommendations in <i>&lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reach Out&rsquo;</i> <i>the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention</i> take place within this context.</P>
        <P>A Cross Sectoral Group on an employment strategy for people with disabilities has also been established by the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and the Department of Health and Children to provide a mechanism for a cross sectoral approach between Departments and their agencies in providing employment services to people with disabilities, including those with mental health difficulties. The group is co-chaired by both departments and also includes representatives from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, F&Aacute;S and the HSE.</P>
        <P>The Office for Disability and Mental Health is also participating in the development by the Department of the Environment, Heritage &amp; Local Government of a housing strategy for people with disabilities which will have a particular emphasis on the housing needs of people with mental health difficulties.  I understand that the strategy will be published in May 2010.</P>

	<P>CervicalCheck is a programme provided by the HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Screening Service.  From September 2009, in line with best international practice, CervicalCheck changed from an open access entry system to an organised call, re-call system of invitation.  This change will ensure that an effective and efficient population approach to screening that maximises target population coverage is maintained.</P>
        <P>CervicalCheck has developed a national register of in excess of 1.1 million eligible women aged 25 to 60 through up-to-date information received from the Department of Social Protection and the women who register directly.  In registering a woman, CervicalCheck requires a minimum dataset to ensure correct identification and matching of clinical information.  Over <Col N="606"/>each screening round, all eligible women aged 25 to 60 will be invited for screening and invitation letters will be posted to women evenly across all age ranges.</P>
        <P>Any woman who has not had a smear test in three years or more, can fast-track a letter of invitation through a choice of on-line registration on www.cervicalcheck.ie, or by completing and returning a form by Freepost or by calling Freephone 1800 45 45 55.</P>
        <P>In 2009 there was an extensive national promotional campaign for CervicalCheck in publications specifically targeting women aged 25 to 60.  Information on CervicalCheck was also targeted at General Practitioners in medical journals.</P>
        <P>During 2009, the first full year of the programme, approximately 280,000 women were screened.</P>
        <P>Due to industrial action affecting the Health Service Executive, it is not possible for the Executive to supply more current information in relation to CervicalCheck.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 281, 369 and 380 together.</P><Col N="607"/>
        <P>The Government decided in the context of Budget 2010 that spending by the Health Service Executive (HSE) on the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) in 2010 should be limited to &euro;63 million. This is the approximate level of expenditure on the DTSS in 2008. The reduction in DTSS expenditure reflects the imperative to achieve overall reductions in public expenditure, including health expenditure. The HSE has developed proposals aimed at containing DTSS expenditure which I am currently considering. No final decisions have yet been taken on the changes to be made to the DTSS.</P>

        <QRef>[14874/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Portiuncula Hospital plays an important part in the HSE West network of acute hospitals. Its budget for 2010 is approximately  &euro;43 million.  The General Manager of the hospital is the budget holder and has local management responsibility for the delivery of services.  In line with its service plan for this year, the hospital is projected to provide services for:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />over 10,000 in-patients</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />more than 7,000 day cases</P>
   <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />20,000 emergency presentations and</P><Col N="609"/>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />42,000 outpatient attendances</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A replacement consultant surgeon post is currently being processed for filling by the Public Appointments Service. The filling of a second replacement consultant surgeon post is being considered by the HSE. Both of these posts are currently filled in a locum capacity.</P>
        <P>The HSE plans to recruit a General Manager with responsibility for Galway University Hospitals, Portiuncula Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital. The recruitment of a General Manager with responsibility for the three hospitals involves the expansion of the previous responsibilities of this post. This is designed to improve management processes, promote good co-ordination between hospitals and to improve services for patients.  It is in line with the approach on the governance of acute hospitals recommended in the Health Information and Quality Authority&rsquo;s Report on Quality and Safety of Services at the Mid Western Regional Hospital Ennis, published in April 2009.  This report identified the importance of integrated governance across hospital networks in ensuring higher quality services for patients.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the plan to recruit a General Manager with responsibility for Galway University Hospitals, Portiuncula Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital will enhance the capacity for collaboration in service provision, provide a more strategic approach to the management of the hospitals concerned and ensure the provision of better and safer services to the people of the region.</P>

If this matter remains of continuing concern to you, however, I would invite you to raise it with me again in due course.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that, under the subvention scheme, the price charged for care is a matter for the nursing home proprietor and the individual. On the 27th October 2009, the subvention scheme was replaced by a new system of financial support, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. In contrast to the subvention scheme, under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme a person pays a contribution, based on 80% of their income and 5% of the value of any assets, and the State then pays the full balance of the cost of care in the nursing home.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the individual referred to by the Deputy may wish to consider transferring to the new Nursing Homes Support Scheme. Information on this scheme is available on the HSE and Department of Health and Children websites or from the local Nursing Homes Support Office at Longford Road, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, Ph: 044-9394995.</P>

        <QRef>[14972/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The entitlement of an individual to services under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996 now rests with the Chief Executive Officer of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  In respect of persons who have made an application  after 20th June 2006, the legal position is clear and unambiguous.  The Chief Executive Officer is bound by the definition of eligibility inserted in the Health (Amendment) Act 2006 by section 6 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006, which requires a positive diagnostic test for applications received after the specified date.</P>
        <P>In respect of persons who made an application before that date, the Chief Executive Officer is still obliged to satisfy himself that the applicant was infected with Hepatitis C.  In that regard, I have asked the HSE to take account of any relevant decision of the Hepatitis C &amp; HIV Compensation Tribunal on the basis that the Tribunal arrives at its decisions after careful consideration of expert testimony.</P>
        <P>I have given a great deal of consideration to the issue of women who have neither a positive test result nor a positive Tribunal decision in their favour and I am very sympathetic to the women in question.  However, I have to take into account the rationale which led to the clarification of eligibility requirements in 2006 and accordingly, I cannot support any dilution of the current eligibility requirements.   If the Deputy has a specific case in mind, I am happy for him to forward the details of this case to me.</P><Col N="613"/>
        <P>I should point out that the women in question are entitled to apply for a regular medical card.  Application forms for a medical card are available from the HSE&rsquo;s local health offices.  The HSE has discretion to award a medical card to a person whose income is over the financial guidelines, where the HSE decides that the financial burden of medical or other exceptional circumstances would cause undue hardship.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two main cost factors associated with medical cards, firstly the capitation and other payments made to General Practitioners (GPs) and, secondly, the cost of drugs supplied to patients.</P>
        <P>GPs who hold contracts under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme with the Health Service Executive (HSE) are remunerated principally on the basis of fees and payments set out in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to General Practitioners) Regulations 2009.  Prior to that, these fees and payments had been agreed as part of the GMS GP contract and amended as appropriate in line with normal wage agreements.  Included among these fees are more than 50 different capitation fees.  The fees vary depending on  the age and gender of the patient and the distance he or she lives from the GP&rsquo;s surgery.  For example, fees currently range from &euro;76.98 for a male patient under 5 years living 3 miles or less from the GP&rsquo;s surgery to &euro;218.37 for a female aged 65-70 years living more than 10 miles from the surgery.  In addition, there are special capitation rates of &euro;280.31 for persons over 70 residing at home and &euro;896.07 <Col N="622"/>for persons over 70 residing in private nursing homes.  There are also a range of additional payments; for example, in respect of out-of-hours consultations, temporary residents, special items of services (e.g. suturing), panel size, practice support allowances and locum expenses.</P>
        <P>As regards the supply of drugs and medicines, medical card holders receive these free of charge.  Drugs costs vary significantly depending on the patient&rsquo;s medical condition.</P>
     <P>Given the number of medical card holders and the variety of payment arrangements and the variation in drug costs over the period 2003 to 2009, a single average annual cost figure in respect of the medical card is not a sufficiently refined measure for policy options and decisions.  However, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to page 24 of the Primary Care Reimbursement Service&rsquo;s (PCRS) Statistical Analysis of Claims and Payments 2007 and 2008 (available on line at:</P>
<P el="0" FLI="0"><i>http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Publications/services/Primary/Primary<?oasys _mv3- ?>_<?oasys _mv-3- ?>Care<?oasys _mv3- ?>_<?oasys _mv-3- ?>Reimbursement<?oasys _mv3- ?>_<?oasys _mv-3- ?> Service<?oasys _mv3- ?>_<?oasys _mv-3- ?>Payments<?oasys _mv3- ?>_<?oasys _mv-3- ?>2007.pdf</i> and <i>http://www.hse.ie/eng/staff/PCRS/PCRS<?oasys _mv3- ?>_<?oasys _mv-3- ?>Publications/FSA 2008.pdf</i>).  These show the number of eligible persons under the GMS Scheme for the period 2003 to 2008, the total payments to doctors and the overall cost of medicines for those years and the Doctors&rsquo; and Pharmacy payments per person for those years.</P>

        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) undertook a national review of Neurology Services to improve integration of services and optimise patient outcomes.  Following consideration of the Review report, the HSE decided to seek an external expert opinion on the model of care proposed to ensure that the recommendations were properly aligned with the HSE Transformation Programme.  The findings of the external experts are currently being considered by the HSE.</P>
        <P>The issue of publication of the review is a matter for the Executive. I wish to advise the Deputy that, due to industrial action affecting the HSE, it is not possible for the Executive to supply current information in relation to this matter.  The information contained herein represents the position at 5 March 2010.</P>

	<P>The Government approved the establishment of a Redress Board to administer an ex-gratia scheme of redress for certain former patients of Dr Neary.  The Board which was chaired by Judge Maureen Harding Clark has concluded its work and all awards determined have been notified to successful applicants.  I consider that the Scheme of Redress approved by the Government on the advice of Judge Clark represents a reasonable response to the findings of the Inquiry in all of the circumstances.  In a number of cases details of former patients of Dr. Neary were forwarded by the Department to the State Claims Agency for their consideration with the agreement of the Minister. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific circumstances of a particular case.</P>

	<P>Lyme disease (also known as Lyme borelliosis) is an infection caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi which is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can sometimes be more severe involving other organs.  Ramblers, campers and those who work in such areas especially if they come into contact with large animals are at greatest risk of being bitten by ticks and of going on to develop the disease. A <Col N="630"/>number of cases are diagnosed each year, but the true figure is unknown. However, research has determined that there are about 30 human cases per year in Ireland. In 2007, 71 specimens were confirmed positive for Lyme borreliosis, suggesting a crude incidence rate of 1.67 per 100,000 that year.  A recent study in the west of Ireland at Galway University Hospital suggests that the disease incidence may be higher in the Galway area.</P>
        <P>Lyme disease is not a notifiable infectious disease in Ireland. This means that there is no legal requirement on doctors to report cases to their local Director of Public Health, so this makes estimates of incidence difficult.  However, the schedule of infectious diseases is reviewed on a periodic basis and inclusion of Lyme disease will be considered in the future.</P>
        <P>A fact sheet on Lyme disease, developed by the Vectorborne Subcommittee of the Scientific Subcommittee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), is available on their website (www.hpsc.ie) to provide members of the general public and media with advice on minimising the risk of Lyme disease. This has recently been updated and provides information on prevention and treatment of Lyme disease.</P>

	<P>In the light of the health risks associated with some of the products being sold in so-called &lsquo;head shops&rsquo;, the Government has agreed to the introduction of regulations under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 which will introduce controls on a range of substances which are currently on sale in head shops. The substances concerned include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />synthetic cannabinoids (SPICE products)</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />benzylpiperazine (BZP) derivatives</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />GBL and 1,4 BD</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Following the introduction of the regulations, the possession and sale of certain substances will be illegal and subject to criminal sanctions under the Misuse of Drugs Act while the possession and sale of other substances will be confined to use in legitimate industrial processes only.</P><Col N="631"/>
        <P>In accordance with EU law, it is necessary to notify the European Commission of the proposed regulations and this imposes a 3 month stand-still period on the making of the regulations. The regulations were notified in early April and allowing for the stand-still period will be implemented at end June/early July.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 apply to named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act. Substances are scheduled in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health here. The list of substances is kept under constant review.</P>

	<P>Regions from within more than a dozen countries, including Ireland, the United States, the United Kingdom and France were &ldquo;blacklisted&rdquo; by the Russian Ministry of Education, thus suspending referrals for adoption.  The issue as it pertains to Ireland relates to Post Placement <Col N="634"/>Reports. When adopting from Russia, adoptive parents agree to complete a series of post placement reports on the child which are to be lodged with the Russian authorities. It should be noted that this is an administrative arrangement as part of the Russian adoption process and not a legal requirement.</P>
        <P>The issue arose previously, in 2009, and was resolved to the satisfaction of the Russian authorities. I was surprised to learn of this latest problem as there had been recent positive feedback from the Russian authorities on this issue and there was no indication that the Russian authorities were about to take the decision to suspend adoptions for Irish applicants.</P>
        <P>Once I became aware of the problem, contact was immediately made with the Russian Embassy in Dublin to confirm the suspension of adoption activity and to seek the Embassy&rsquo;s assistance in identifying all outstanding reports. On receipt of this information the Health Service Executive, in conjunction with the Adoption Board, examined the list and the up to date position in relation to the reports was compiled. According to information received from the HSE, more than half of the reports listed by the Russian authorities as outstanding were previously completed by the adoptive parents and forwarded to the Russian Embassy in Dublin. The majority of the remaining reports have been completed by the HSE and are currently with the adoptive parents. In a small number of cases, adoptive parents have not engaged with the HSE, thus preventing the completion of reports. I met with diplomats from the Russian Embassy yesterday in order to review the position and with a view to re-opening the adoption process for Irish applicants.</P>
        <P>I am very aware of the anxiety experienced by those who are waiting to adopt from Russia as a result of this issue. Parents who have already adopted from Russia are being encouraged by the health authorities to provide any outstanding information to the Russian Government in a timely fashion .</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 392 to 397, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The framework agreement to which the Deputy refers was concluded between the then interim Health Service Executive and the trade union IMPACT on 23 December 2004, prior to the establishment of the Health Service Executive (HSE) on 1 January 2005.  My Department <Col N="636"/>was not involved with either the negotiations or content of this agreement.  Section 22 of the Health Act 2004, the legislation under which the HSE was established, provides that the HSE has responsibility for the recruitment of employees, in accordance with the Public Service Management  (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  The Health Act 2004, also provides that the HSE shall determine the terms and conditions of employment of employees and their grade.  However, the Executive does require my approval, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>With regards to a review of the operation of this agreement, I understand that discussions between the HSE and IMPACT,  for the purpose of reviewing and agreeing changes to this Framework Agreement and to agree an ongoing process to deal with organisational changes, are already underway at the Labour Relations Commission.  This is referred to in the Draft Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, which is under consideration by all public sector unions.</P>
        <P>Implementation of this agreement is a matter for the HSE.  However, I wish to advise the Deputy that, due to industrial action affecting the Executive, it is not possible for the Executive to supply the information requested in relation to the detailed operation of this agreement and the resolution of disputes arising under it.  If this matter remains of continuing concern to you, however, I would invite you to raise it with me again in due course.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.</P>
        <P>Since the commencement of the scheme 35,000 applications have been received by the Scheme Administrator. As of 9 April 21,274 offers of repayment totalling over &euro;434 million have been made and 19,074 payments have been completed to the value of  over &euro;428 million. <Col N="638"/>In the region of 50 applications remain to be determined.   The delay in completing these outstanding applications is due to the quality of available records, probate issues and difficulties in determining eligibility status of claimants.  The time taken to process each application is dependent on the complexity of the application and the availability of accurate records.  In addition an offer of repayment cannot be completed until the statutory 28 appeal period has elapsed and a completed form of acceptance returned to the Scheme Administrator.  Claimants must be given the opportunity to appeal the decision of the Scheme Administrator and the appeals process will impact on the overall timeframe for the completion of repayments under the Scheme.</P>

	<P>The Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office is an independent office established to provide an appeals service to those who wish to appeal the decision of the Scheme Administrator under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006. </P>
        <P>1,464 appeals were determined in 2009 and 225 have been determined in 2010. The Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office continues to receive completed Appeals Forms and it is anticipated that the majority of appeals will be determined before the end of 2010. Information submitted to my Department on waiting times for appeals to be determined does not distinguish between those where an Oral Hearing has been requested and those where no such Hearing is sought. As of 9 April 2010, the average  time for all appeals that have been determined  is 221 calendar days.</P>
        <P>The Appeals Officers must investigate each appeal independently, these investigations can require additional reviews by the Health Service Executive and the Scheme Administrator and certain appeals present a high level of complexity. In addition a very high percentage of appellants have requested an Oral Hearing with an Appeals Officer. </P>
        <P>The Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office was established in December 2006. Two Appeals Officers have been appointed to consider appeals and the Office has four administration staff. The cost of administering the Appeals office since its establishment in 2006 up to 31 December 2009 is &euro;1.567million.  Salaries are paid to the Appeals Officers and staff by the Department of Health and Children. These salaries are then refunded on a quarterly basis to the Department of Health and Children from the Special Account as provided for under section 13 of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Applicants under the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement in the public health sector (ISER) are not eligible for re-employment in the public health sector.  I understand that the employees to which this question refers,  did not receive an early retirement &lsquo;package&rsquo;, rather they got their normal superannuation entitlements provided for under  Section 66(1)(c) the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  Under this Act, retirees whose names have been added to a register established under Section 65 of the Act, have a minimum retirement age of 55 and access to doubling of years for service in excess of 20 years. It should be noted that  these provisions  do not apply to new entrants as defined by the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2004 (Section 12 of that Act). </P>
        <P>The (Pensions) Abatement Act 1965 provides the legislative basis for the suspension or reduction of an allowance (pension) where, after retirement, a scheme pensioner is employed in an agency/organisation in which the superannuation scheme paying the pension applies. Remuneration plus pension for the specified period should not exceed the up-rated remuneration for the post from which the pensioner retired. Abatement of pension (Circular 21/2005 refers) applies in all cases where the employer needs to re-engage the services of persons in receipt of pension.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the HSE that it only resorts to the use of a retired employee to meet particular frontline service needs which cannot be met in any other way. The 2010 Employment Control Framework for the health service has been approved. The Framework provides the HSE with the ability to deal with critical exceptions to the moratorium once the overall reduction in health employment numbers, as agreed by Government, are being met. The Framework provides for a number of exceptions to the general moratorium on recruitment, promotion and acting up. I am pleased to report that the first 100 psychiatric nurse vacancies that arise can be filled (by psychiatric nurses or otherwise) to support the implementation of A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>I regret that due to industrial action in HSE I am not in a position to provide a substantive response in relation to the named individuals to which your  Parliamentary Question refers.  If this matter remains of continuing concern to you, however, I would invite you to raise it with me again in due course.</P>

	<P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  I wish to advise the Deputy that due to industrial action affecting the Health Service Executive it is not possible for the Executive to supply information in relation to the number of unfilled consultant and NCHD posts in specific hospitals.  If this matter remains of continuing concern to you, however, I would invite you to raise it with me again in due course.</P>
        <P>Government policy is to increase consultant numbers in the hospital sector with a related decrease in NCHD numbers.  The moratorium on recruitment in the health sector is framed so as to provide the necessary level of flexibility to support the implementation of this policy.  Against this background, the HSE recently advised my Department that the number of medical consultant posts in the health service increased by 70 wholetime equivalent posts between 31 December 2008 and 31 January 2010. Annual increases in consultant numbers have been the norm in recent years as we move towards a consultant delivered service.</P>
        <P>Concerns have been expressed in relation to a possible reduction in NCHD numbers when the new rotational cycle commences in July.  I understand that the HSE, in order to ensure adequate NCHD staffing levels and continued service delivery, has established a Human Resources and Integrated Services Directorate Group to address the matter.  This Group is currently working on initiatives to ensure that services will continue to be available when the new rotations commence in July 2010.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 444, 448 and 450 together.  </P>
        <P>Civil aviation security at EU airports is governed by Regulations (EC) Nos. 300/2008 and, 185/2010, which are due to come into effect on 29 April 2010.  The Annex to Regulation (EC) No. 185/2010 contains a list of items that are prohibited from being carried in the hold of an aircraft.  This list of prohibited items is available to the public.</P>
        <P>Among the items listed as prohibited from being carried in the hold of an aircraft is ammunition.  However, according to point 5.4.2 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) 185/2010, exemptions may be granted on condition that the appropriate authority has national rules permitting the carriage of the article and, that applicable safety rules are complied with.</P>
        <P>To date Ireland has allowed for the carrying of ammunition in hold baggage provided that certain conditions are complied with.  We intend, in common with most EU Member States to continue to permit the carriage of ammunition in hold baggage provided that it is declared and transported in accordance with Dangerous Goods Regulations and it is the policy of the air carrier in question to allow for the carriage of such items.</P>

	<P>Refurbishment works are well advanced in the Leeson Lane building, and the installation of the new equipment is well underway.  The testing of the installed Integrated Communications System (ICS) and the training for Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) staff will commence in May 2010.  The ICS system is expected to be live by July.  The dual operation of the new and old equipment in the Dublin will last for at least a four-week period, after which the MRCC function will transfer building later this year.</P><Col N="651"/>
        <P>The equipment for Malin and Valentia Marine Rescue Sub Co-ordination Centres has been delivered to the Coast Guard Stores and will be activated as soon as possible.  It is important that the current ICS systems in Valentia and Malin are not changed until Dublin is complete and connected to all radio sites so that the required redundancy is available.  The adaptation of the buildings in Malin and Valentia to take the new configuration is awaiting an Office of Public Works report.  It is anticipated that work will commence on one of the Centres in late 2010 and on the other building in 2011, subject to funding.</P>

	<P>It is the Department&rsquo;s policy to use only recycled paper wherever possible.  Approximately 95% of A3 and A4 sized paper used by the Department of Transport is recyclable.  The remaining 5% relates to specialist paper used mainly for colour presentations, for which the paper has to be heavier and more robust for effective and efficient reproduction. Annual data on the number of reams used is currently being collated and I will write separately to the Deputy once this is to hand.</P>
        <P>Insofar as the agencies under the aegis of the Department of Transport are concerned, the arrangements for the procurement of paper is a matter that is dealt with directly by the agencies concerned.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 455 to 457, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The carriage of weapons and munitions of war on civilian aircraft is prohibited under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Orders, 1973 and 1989, unless an exemption from this prohibition is granted by the Minister for Transport.  The 1989 Order amended the 1973 Order to allow the Minister to specify the particular aircraft operation that he may exempt from the requirements of Articles 6 or 7 of the Orders. Previously the 1973 Order had provided for exemptions for a class of aircraft rather than a specific aircraft operation.  The number of exemptions issued since 1 January 2010 is approximately 420.</P>
        <P>The origin and destination of the flight is specified in the application for an exemption.  In respect of each application the Department of Transport seeks the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs in relation to foreign policy, the Department of Justice and Law Reform in relation to security and, if the weapons/munitions are classified as &lsquo;dangerous goods&rsquo; by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the views of the Irish Aviation Authority in relation to air safety.  If any of these bodies objects, the Minister will not grant an exemption.  For security reasons it is not the practice to comment on any reasons given for refusal in any particular case unless the cargo is of a nature that its carriage is specifically prohibited under international law (e.g. the carriage of landmines is prohibited under the provisions of the Ottawa Convention).  Each application for an exemption is also sent to the Department of Defence for information.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Construction will continue on the N18 Gort to Crusheen and on the N21 Castleisland Bypass, with both projects expected to be completed in 2011.</P>
        <P>Two major public transport projects have already been completed this year &mdash; the Kildare Route Project and Phase 1 of the Western Rail Corridor.  The Luas extension to Cherrywood and Phase 1 of the Navan Rail line will both open later this year, and construction is continuing on the Luas extension to Citywest, which is due for completion in 2011.</P>
        <P>The oral hearing before An Bord Plean&aacute;la for Metro North concluded on March 10 and it is expected that a decision on the railway order application will be made later this year.  Planning, design and consultation on the DART Underground Programme will continue in 2010 and Irish Rail hopes to make an application for a railway order later in the year.  It is also hoped to make applications for railway orders in respect of Luas line BX/D (Cross City Centre/Liffey Junction) and Metro West in 2010.  Work is continuing on the Dublin city centre resignalling project, the Quality Bus Network in the Greater Dublin Area, traffic management in regional cities, the Railway Safety Programme, the integrated ticketing project and the automatic vehicle location system being rolled out on Dublin Bus services.</P>
        <P>2010 will see increased investment in Smarter Travel measures to improve the sustainability of our travel and transport systems.  Among the projects to be progressed are the Portobello to Fairview and Adamstown off-road cycle routes in Dublin; the Rochestown to Passage West route and the Carrigaline cycle network in Cork; and the Fisheries Field route in Galway.   Some 30 other projects around the country will be supported under the Smarter Travel Demonstration Projects Fund.  I will announce, in June, the areas that will be supported under the Smarter Travel Areas Competition.</P>
        <P>Other projects ongoing include essential capital works at the country&rsquo;s regional airports, remedial projects at regional harbours and Irish Coastguard building projects.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 479 and 480 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Good Friday Agreement. Part of that was the setting up of a Scheme to disburse monies under a number of headings to victims of the Northern Ireland Conflict.</P>
        <P>In 2003, the Government established the Remembrance Commission with a budget of up to &euro;9m, of which &euro;1.5m was allocated for victim support services. From 2003-2008 the Remembrance Commission operated a Scheme of Acknowledgement, Remembrance and Assistance for Victims in this Jurisdiction of the Conflict in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Under the Scheme, payments could be made to individuals under various categories such as acknowledgement payments, economic hardship payments and medical expenses payments. The Scheme also contained a provision to enable payments to be paid to groups offering support services to victims of the conflict. Under this element of the Scheme payments were made to the organisation to which the Deputy refers for the purpose of meeting the counselling and other needs of victims or their family members.  During the period of operation of the Scheme this organisation received a total of &euro;1.2m of the &euro;1.5m allocated for victim support services and was the only recipient of money under this heading. The provision of these services, which were supportive and sensitive to the needs of victims, was made in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement. In addition the organisation had received over &euro;890,000 from the Department of the Taoiseach in the period 2000-2003.</P>
        <P>The term of appointment of the Remembrance Commission came to an end on 31 October 2008.  Therefore, funding under the Scheme is no longer available. I took a decision, however, to grant further funding to the group totalling &euro;190,300 to enable it to continue to operate while seeking to put alternative funding options in place.</P>
        <P>As I have made clear, my first priority is to ensure that those victims who require ongoing medical treatment for injuries sustained in bombings and other incidents arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland will continue to be provided for.  I have made special arrangements to have these costs provided by my Department through the Victims of Crime Office.</P>

	<P>The status of diplomatic and other staff of foreign missions, including private domestic workers or private servants employed by diplomats, is regulated by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which, under the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967, has the force of law in the State.  The Convention provides that the sending state must notify the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, or such other ministry as may be agreed, in the receiving state of the arrival and departure of diplomatic staff, their family members and private servants and the engagement and discharge of persons resident in the receiving state as members of the mission or private servants entitled to privileges and immunities.</P>
        <P>Persons who are in the State as private domestic workers for foreign diplomats are given an endorsement in their passport by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service which acknowledges their status in the State.

Therefore the statistical information sought by the Deputy is not available.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 485 and 486 together.</P>
        <P>Section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud) Offences Act, 2001 provides for the offence of making gain or causing loss by deception.  Any complaints received by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding the activities referred to by the Deputy are the subject of investigation and possible criminal proceedings where the evidence disclosed so warrants.</P>
        <P>The role of the Garda&iacute; is to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The question of whether or not a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP.  The Director, who is independent in the performance of his functions, makes his decision on the basis of the Garda findings viewed against the background of common and/or statute law.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.</P>
        <P>I have requested the CSO to provide relevant statistics directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 1 November 2004.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until her application for asylum was decided.  Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 30 November 2007, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving <Col N="662"/>the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might wish to note that following a request from the legal representative of the person concerned, my Department has given a commitment that no final decision will be made on the case of the person concerned pending the outcome of the asylum applications of her four children in respect of whom individual asylum applications have been lodged.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in December 2009.</P>
        <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. One such condition is that the person in question intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation. In the application submitted, the person concerned did not confirm her intention to reside in the State after naturalisation.</P>
        <P>Consequently, the Citizenship Division of my Department have deemed her application ineligible. The person in question was informed of this decision in a letter issued to her on 23 December, 2009.</P>
        <P>It is open to the person concerned to lodge a new application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when she is in a position to meet the statutory requirements.</P>

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in April 2008.</P>
        <P>All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of the application has commenced and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the  new Sexual Crime Management Unit operates within the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit, and is located at Harcourt Square, Dublin 2, under the direction of  D/Chief Superintendent, National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The unit will evaluate and monitor, in conjunction with investigating members and local senior management, a number of investigations each year of child neglect, child sexual abuse and other selected sexual offences.

This document was prepared by a High Level Group in my Department, involving the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service, which examined the current arrangements in place for the management of sex offenders  with a view to strengthening inter-agency cooperation and further enhancing public protection and safety. <Col N="666"/> Their remit included a review of the procedures and legislation relating to the assessment, monitoring and supervision of convicted sex offenders.</P>
        <P>The Discussion Document was published on my Department&rsquo;s website and interested organisations and individuals were invited to make submissions by end of April, 2009. I also facilitated informed debate at a Discussion Forum organised by my Department in March.</P>

        <P>I should also say that  in April, 2009 I  formally announced a new policy on the management of sex offenders in prison which had commenced earlier in the year. The policy is aimed at bringing about changes in  offenders&rsquo; lives that reduce risk of re-offending and enhance public protection.

	<P>145 sex offenders have been released from custody onto probation supervision over the past five years. All of these prisoners were assessed by a Probation Officer either prior to or shortly after release from custody.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and in meeting a commitment of the Public Protection Advisory Group established under the Intergovernmental agreement, the Probation Service is implementing a system for the risk assessment of sex offenders.  Combining both  static and dynamic risk assessments instruments, an enhanced pre-release assessment will be undertaken on all offenders subject to post release supervision. These instruments, Risk Matrix 2000 (static) and the Stable and Acute 2007 (dynamic), have been used in completing a total of 43 pre-release assessments since 2008.</P>
        <P>As of May 2010, these instruments will be used to support the assessment all sex offenders subject to supervision by the Probation Service, including those being released from custody onto supervision.</P>
        <P>I should also say that  in April, 2009 I  formally announced a new policy on the management of sex offenders in prison which had commenced earlier in the year. The policy is aimed at bringing about changes in  offenders&rsquo; lives that reduce risk of re-offending and enhance public protection.  The  policy document is available for the Deputy to read on the website of the Irish Prison Service (www.irishprisons.ie).</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Probation Service of my Department is supported in its core work in the community by over 50 projects. Perhaps it is helpful to the Deputy and the House if I begin by saying that this year my Department will provide funding in the region of &euro;11m to these projects which are spread <Col N="668"/>across all constituencies. To the best of my knowledge all of the projects  operate with community support and but for the voluntary participation of local people who agree to sit on the boards of management of the projects the State could not support the various client groups in the community thus assisting in reintegration, improving job skills and generally assisting in increasing community safety and reducing the cost to business and society of crime. </P>
        <P>Like all streams of taxpayers&rsquo; funding it is important that we constantly monitor and evaluate such funding and the Department undertook a Value for Money and Policy Review of all Funded Projects. The report  was published on my  Department&rsquo;s website on 2 September 2008. The conclusions were broadly favourable, recognising the importance of the support provided by community based projects to the work of the Probation Service. The Probation Service has a dedicated unit in place within its structures to implement the range of recommendations set out in the report and to constantly examine the added value provided by individual projects.</P>
        <P>Having put our support for community projects in broad  context let me return to the Project the subject of this Question which has  operated in the Dublin 1 area for the past 15 years. Let me set out what the Project does: it provides an intensive supervision programme for male offenders, in the 20 to 25 years age group, in the greater Dublin area who are subject to Probation Service supervision. It can cater for up to 12 clients at any one time and the programme is delivered during office hours from Monday to Friday. Those who come to the project do so by appointment. The programme itself is delivered by a multidisciplinary team with the Probation Service as the lead agency. The other partners are the City of Dublin VEC and F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>For absolute clarity let me again say that this  project is not an addiction treatment centre, a drop-in centre, or a residential centre.  The project has the benefit of 15 years experience in its current premises delivering a necessary service.</P>
        <P>Turning to plans to move to new premises a 25 year lease, operative from June, 2008 is in existence. In August 2009 approval was given to the Board of Management to tender for the fit-out of the proposed new premises. The work was advertised on e-tenders by the project and contracts were awarded last December.</P>
        <P>During the negotiations for the lease my  Department was advised by the Chief State Solicitors Office and it had no reason to believe the planning permission for a change of use, from commercial to office use, obtained by the landlord prior to the Department&rsquo;s interest in the ground floor space was not valid. However, the Department has been made aware that queries have been raised around the status of the planning permission in existence in recent times. In fact, issues around planning were brought to attention by letter on 22nd March by the Planning and Enforcement Office of Dublin City Council. Those matters are being examined in consultation with our legal advisers and my Department&rsquo;s response to the letter of the 22nd March was submitted yesterday. It would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage pending consideration of our response by the Council.</P>
        <P>I would also like to put on record that neither I nor my Department has now, nor in the past,  any interest in circumventing planning regulations in order to move the work of a project that has operated in Dublin 1 for 15 years to more suitable premises within Dublin 1.   All our negotiations were done in good faith and the issues that came to attention are being examined as quickly and as diligently as possible.</P>
        <P>I trust the Deputy will accept the <i>bona fides</i> of this project, which has been running in the inner city for a considerable number of years, supporting some of the most vulnerable citizens in the Capital to lead more constructive lives. It is long recognised that targeted interventions do help reduce re-offending and, in turn, foster community safety and reduce the cost to business and private citizens. The project &mdash; based on its 15 years of experience &mdash; now needs new <Col N="669"/>premises to continue its valuable work. Deputies on all sides will recognise that I have a duty to balance the taxpayers&rsquo; interest having committed substantial funding to the fit-out and rent of a city centre premises  and the House may be assured that I will be conscious of this responsibility in attempting to deal with the issues around the planning situation.</P>

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in April 2008.</P>
        <P>All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee.  In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible.  Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is at an advanced stage and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 14 May 2007.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 9 November 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned has submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

        <P>Given that the person concerned had no legal basis for remaining in the State, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), she was notified by letter dated 30 November 2007 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation <Col N="675"/>Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 271 of 30 March 2010 the rational behind RIA&rsquo;s policy to disperse asylum seekers, unaccompanied minors at age 18 to centres outside Dublin when they are in the process of further educational courses. </Quest>
        <QRef>[14789/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated in my response of 30 March, 2010, asylum seekers deemed to be unaccompanied minors by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) are referred to the HSE which has responsibility for their care under the Child Care Act, 1991 until they reach 18 years of age.  Upon reaching that age, such &lsquo;aged out minors&rsquo; are referred by the HSE to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) for transfer to adult accommodation and service provision.  In circumstances where the HSE deem such a person to be particularly vulnerable, the period in HSE care can be extended beyond 18 years of age.</P>
        <P>It is RIA&rsquo;s policy to disperse aged-out minors to family oriented accommodation centres outside Dublin which have established links to HSE services and NGO supports.  The rationale behind this policy, which was agreed between RIA and the HSE, is straightforward.  Firstly, it relieves the pressure in the Dublin area on bed spaces and, more importantly, on health, education, therapeutic and welfare services.  Secondly, it reduces the negative influences &mdash; crime, drug abuse and so on &mdash; that the big city environment in Dublin can have on aged out minors who have limited financial means and who have no family support.  Thirdly, it provides a standardised and equitable approach to all asylum seekers over the age of 18 availing of RIA accommodation, thus ensuring fairness.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 520 and 521 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware the Probation Service, in common with the rest of the Civil Service, is subject to the Government&rsquo;s moratorium on recruitment and promotion and its staff also <Col N="676"/>have access to the Incentivised Career Break Scheme and the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement, which are available to staff in the Civil Service.  Where vacancies do arise, the Probation Service is required to prioritise its workload and allocate its resources to maximise its efficiency and effectiveness and minimise the impact on the delivery of frontline services.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that the Courts have been made aware of the impact of the Government&rsquo;s moratorium on recruitment and priority is being given to assessments that are legally required to be carried out by the Probation Service.  The Probation Service is also prioritising its work on the supervision of offenders by focusing more on high risk cases, Community Service Orders and young offenders.  The categories identified in these Questions fall into the prioritised work of the Probation Service.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> if the Romanian and Bulgarian partners of Irish citizens resident in Ireland have unrestricted access to the labour market here; if an application process is required to prove their status as partners of Irish citizens, and if so, the requirements of the application process including the office to which such applications should be made. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is assumed, for the purposes of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, that the Bulgarian or Romanian national does not qualify in their own right for access to the labour market (for instance, having held a work permit for 12 months) and that their access is dependant on their relationship with an Irish national.</P>
        <P>As a general rule the Romanian or Bulgarian partner of an Irish citizen, who can provide evidence of a durable attested relationship with that person of at least 2 years duration, will be exempt from the requirement to hold an employment permit.  However, it is important to stress that both the Romanian or Bulgarian national and their partner must be resident in the State as a family unit.</P>
        <P>Applications should be made to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and should include copies of the current passports of both parties.  In order to assess the de facto relationship evidence of the finances of both parties and of a relationship of at least two years duration will be required.  This evidence should take the form of documents which can demonstrate the interdependence of the partners, such as, a shared tenancy agreement, shared utility bills or a shared bank account.  However, the Immigration authorities may require additional evidence depending on the circumstances of the particular case.</P>

        <P>I should add that permission to remain in the State only becomes operative when it has been registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

	<P>The person in question arrived in the State on 29 March 2005 and applied for asylum.  Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Commissioner, it was determined that the person in question had previously made an asylum application in France and, as such, his asylum claims should be examined by the French authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulations. This determination was upheld following an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Consequently, a Dublin II Regulation Transfer Order was signed in respect of him on 29 July 2005, obliging him to &lsquo;present&rsquo; to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on 15 August 2005, to make arrangements for his return to France. The person in question failed to &lsquo;present&rsquo; for transfer and became illegally present in this State at that time.  However, after 18 months the extended Transfer Order expired and Ireland became responsible for processing the asylum application. At this point the person in question was admitted into the Irish asylum process at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner for the purposes of having his asylum claims investigated.</P>
        <P>His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  The person in question was notified of his entitlement to appeal this recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal but he did not do so. As a result, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person in question was informed, by letter dated 9 July 2007, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should not have a Deportation Order made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  No response was received in my Department to this letter.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the person in question will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  Any representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person in question.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 9 September 2003.  She was accompanied to the State by her daughter and nephew, both minors at that time and both of whom were included in the asylum application of the person concerned.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until her application for asylum was decided.  Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 15 June 2005, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her, her daughter and her nephew.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against her and the children. Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned at that time.</P>
        <P>The person concerned subsequently submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P><Col N="687"/>
        <P>The person concerned initiated Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in her case. Following the refusal of the Judicial Review proceedings, the legal representative of the person concerned was advised that as the daughter and nephew of the person concerned had reached the age of 18, their cases would be considered as individuals and, as such, they were advised of their respective entitlements to submit representations and/or applications for Subsidiary Protection in the State in their own right. No such applications have been received to date.</P>
        <P>The case file of the person concerned now falls to be considered for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I.

When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

        <P>The position in the State of the person concerned now falls to be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

	<P>Valid applications for certificates of naturalisation from the persons referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question were received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in November 2007.</P>
        <P>All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. However, I understand that the persons concerned are refugees. In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of both applications is at an advanced stage and the files will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 3 August 2004.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. </P>
        <P>The person concerned was informed, by letter dated 6 January 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her. She was given three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), to be exercised within 15 working days. Namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.</P>
        <P>Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 20 April 2005, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her.</P>
        <P>Notice of this Order was served by registered post requiring her to &lsquo;present&rsquo; to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 28 April 2005. The person concerned failed to &lsquo;present&rsquo; as requested and was classified as evading her deportation.</P>
        <P>The persons&rsquo; legal representative made an application for permission to remain in the State on the basis of being a family dependant of the parent of an Irish born child who has been granted permission to remain under the IBC/05 scheme. This application was refused. The person concerned and her legal representative were advised of this decision by letter dated 21 August 2008.</P>
        <P>Further representations were received from the person concerned asking that her Deportation Order be revoked, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). Following consideration of the information submitted, the Deportation Order was affirmed and the person concerned and her legal representative were advised of this decision by letter dated 3 March 2009.</P>
        <P>Further representations were received from the person concerned asking that her Deportation Order be revoked, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). Following consideration of the information submitted, the Deportation Order was affirmed and the person concerned and her legal representative were advised of this decision by letter dated 31 March 2010. The person concerned was also required to &lsquo;present&rsquo; to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum and for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her is justified.</P>
        <P>The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of the Deportation Order is, and remains, an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>

	<P>All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife related crime.  Areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the <Col N="692"/>subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.  Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour reported to the Garda authorities are the subject of investigation and are dealt with appropriately in accordance with the law.  Over 611,000 offences have been detected since the establishment of Operation &lsquo;Encounter&rsquo;, which was commenced by the then Commissioner in February, 2002, to target public disorder and anti-social behaviour against the local and business communities. </P>
        <P>Local policing plans are predicated on the prevention of anti-social and public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. Patrols are directed to pay particular attention to those areas where local youths tend to congregate and where the likelihood of anti-social behaviour may arise in order to reduce incidences of public disorder and anti-social behaviour type activities.</P>
        <P>Legislation on the use of knives and similar weapons is extremely robust and heavy penalties are in place.  The Garda Commissioner made recommendations in relation to knives and sharply pointed or bladed weapons, and subsequently I introduced legislation which was enacted as the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  The maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place has been increased from one to five years, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been given an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the new legislation, samurai swords have been banned from importation and sale, though exceptions have been made for collectors and martial artists.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the Garda Commissioner and I launched a Knife Awareness Campaign by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to inform and educate young people on the dangers of carrying knives and with the aim of reducing the number of incidents of knife crime. The campaign targeted a young male audience with messages delivered through role models in both the sporting and media world and incorporated a series of local roadshow events as well a dedicated website and a presence on social networking sites.</P>
        <P>Statistics show that nearly one third of knife crimes occur in domestic settings and often with a degree of spontaneity, which increases the challenges of policing and enforcement.  The whole area of knives and knife crime is kept under constant review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Garda&iacute; for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.  This would, of course, include many healthcare professionals.</P>
        <P>The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives &mdash; 187,864 in 2007; 218,404 in 2008 and 246,194 in 2009.</P><Col N="693"/>
        <P>The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase, for training placements for example.  Additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad. There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  However, the Garda&iacute; make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the average processing time for valid vetting applications received at the GCVU may vary from four to five weeks in periods of lower demand to up to about 12 weeks at times when demand is particularly high.</P>
        <P>The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  There is currently a total of 78 personnel assigned to the vetting unit, including six Garda&iacute; and 72 Garda civilian personnel.  This represents a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development in Garda vetting began in 2005.  Temporary additional resources are currently being sought to help address the significant level of applications.</P>

	<P>At my request, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate carried out an inspection of resource allocation, including personnel,  in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate recently published this report entitled, Report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate &mdash; Resource Allocation, the contents of which are currently being examined by the Garda Commissioner and senior management. The report is available in the Inspectorate&rsquo;s web site at www.gsinsp.ie.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner, with his senior managers and Divisional Officers, arranges for the allocation of Garda personnel throughout the State.  Garda management is aided in this by a distribution model known as the Garda Establishment Redistribution Model (GERM).</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Commissioner that this model indicates the most effective means to distribute Garda personnel and acts as a guide to Garda management decision making.  It takes into account many different policing variables, including crime trends, socio-economic factors, and census information.  The allocation of Garda personnel is determined by these factors and also takes account of the policing requirements of each individual Division.</P>

	<P>The Civil Partnership Bill 2009 gives same-sex couples the option of registering in a civil partnership, conferring a range of rights and obligations, including in relation to succession, shared home and financial matters. Marriage, under the Constitution, continues to attract particular protection, and is understood as a matter of constitutional jurisprudence to be only between one man and one woman, ideally for life. Civil partnership is distinct from marriage and in no way diminishes its special constitutional status.</P><Col N="698"/>
        <P>The Civil Registration Act 2004 provides that it is an offence for a registrar to fail or refuse, without reasonable cause, to register a birth, stillbirth, marriage or death.  The Civil Partnership Bill amends the 2004 Act to replicate these provisions with respect to civil partnership registration.  Neither the 2004 Act nor the Bill contains a &ldquo;right of conscience&rdquo; provision for registrars.  Registrars routinely register marriages of people who are divorced from a previous spouse, and the matter of freedom of conscience has never been raised in relation to such marriages.</P>
        <P>The Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 provide that it is an offence to discriminate against a person for employment purposes or in the provision of goods and services on the basis of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race or membership of the Traveller community.  The Civil Partnership Bill amends the Equality Acts to extend this protection to civil partnership registration by replacing the marital status ground with a new &ldquo;civil status&rdquo; ground.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not contain any exemption from the obligation not to discriminate in the provision of goods and services, whether on the basis of religious belief or otherwise.  Providing such an exemption could lead to serious unintended consequences and service being withheld from people in all sorts of situations &mdash; from a bank refusing to allow a couple operate a joint account, to a restaurant refusing to take a booking for two men or two women, to a person&rsquo;s partner being unable to visit in hospital purely because an ambulance took a patient to a religious-run hospital.   Such outcomes would be directly contrary to public policy, therefore a &lsquo;freedom of conscience&rsquo; exemption could not be countenanced.</P>

	<P>The Probation Service has enjoyed a significant increase in resources in recent years, such that despite the impact of the Moratorium and other associated measures such as the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER) and the Incentivised Career Break Scheme (ICBS), the number of staff working in the Service is still greater than at the end of 2006 and only marginally less than at the end of 2007.  Excluding those vacancies arising from staff availing of ISER and ICBS (both of which Schemes were specifically designed to reduce Civil Service numbers), 28 whole-time equivalent vacancies have arisen since the introduction of the Moratorium.  Of these, 21 are in the ranks of Probation Officer/Community Service Supervisor with the remainder from Administrative Support Staff.</P>

	<P>Section 59 (2) of the Prison Rules, 2007 allows for the discretionary granting of additional remission, up to one third as opposed to the standard rate of one quarter, where a prisoner has shown further good conduct through his engagement in authorised structured activity and where, as a result, the prisoner is less likely to re-offend and will be better able to reintegrate into the community.</P>
        <P>I can at the outset advise the Deputy that this additional concession will only be awarded in exceptional cases and where I am satisfied beyond any doubt that the prisoner concerned has demonstrated that she/he meets the requirements as set out in the Prison Rules. Perhaps I should also point to the fact that despite this additional opportunity to earn additional remission our remission rates are significantly below those currently operating in the UK and Northern Ireland where rates of 50% are in place.</P>
        <P>While there are a number of applications for extra remission under consideration at present, to date one prisoner has been granted this concession.  It is not possible to provide the number of applications as each case is dealt with on an individual basis and this would require the manual examination of records going back over a considerable time period.  Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As indicated in 2003 when this report was published, there are strong reservations about interpreting the main finding of the study as suggesting that over 28% of the prisoner population in the country have a mental handicap.  Any such suggestion is strongly disputed by people who work with prisoners in a professional capacity on a daily basis and there is a reasonable basis for argument that this unexpectedly high figure could be accounted for by measurement of factors attributable to educational deficit and social disadvantage, rather than learning disability per se. The authors of the report recommended that a number of priority steps be taken in relation to prisoners with learning disability.  These recommendations fall into three main categories:</P>

<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>(i) <?oasys _ix ?>psychological assessment of prisoners identified as having a learning disability,</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p2- ?>(ii) <?oasys _ix ?>provision of training for personnel on needs and supports for people with learning disability and</P>
<P el="5">(iii) <?oasys _ix ?>development of appropriate educational programmes in prisons designed to address the needs and learning characteristics of prisoners with learning disability.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">In this context I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that, at present, the routine medical, probation and education assessments at committal result in prisoners with learning disability coming to notice early in their time in custody.  Such prisoners are provided with a range of supports appropriate to their circumstances, including, as required, <Col N="700"/>referral for psychological assessment and special arrangements within education units and workshops.</P>
<P>Such prisoners may also be referred to the Prison Psychology Service for assistance in coping with their incarceration and in dealing with their offending behaviour.   As necessary, on a case by case basis, the Psychology Service, in conjunction with the Probation Service, makes contact with community-based services in supporting the reintegration of offenders back into the community.  This would include voluntary and statutory services working within the learning difficulties sector.</P>
<P>Since September 2007, all recruit prison officers (RPOs) complete a Higher Certificate in Custodial Care programme. The objective of the two year Higher Certificate programme is to provide a professional development framework for RPOs and equip them with a range of skills and competencies that will enable them to carry out their duties in a professional manner. Many of the modules cover areas around mental health and wellbeing.  The health care module covers health promotion, mental and emotional health, special health issues in prison and substance misuse.  Other modules cover equality and diversity awareness, sociology for custodial care and ethics in custodial care.</P>
<P>The Prison Education Service, which involves a partnership between the Irish Prison Service and a range of educational agencies including the VECs, provides a broad programme of education for prisoners following an adult education approach.  Education centres are in operation in all prisons and places of detention. There is substantial flexibility in education delivery, with significant provision for one-to-one teaching which is particularly relevant to prisoners with a learning disability.</P>
<P>Following on the recommendations of the 2003 report commissioned by my Department entitled &ldquo;The Prison Adult Literacy Survey &mdash; Results and Implications&rdquo;, a number of significant initiatives commenced or were strengthened in the prisons. These initiatives parallel efforts to address adult literacy in the community. Among these are the fuller use of negotiated learning plans for all literacy students, introducing and supporting the FETAC level 1 and level 2 courses, the introduction of a standardised assessment framework across all prisons, devising and delivering the national 30-hour Initial Tutor Training course for new teachers and developing and rolling out a national Literacy Plan for Prison Education &mdash; work on which commenced in 2009.</P>

	<P>In 2003 the results of a survey commissioned by my Department were published in the Irish Prison Service publication entitled &ldquo;The Prison Adult Literacy Survey &mdash; Results and Implications&rdquo;. The survey found that a significant number of prisoners were not functionally literate, with 52% of them at Level 1 or Pre-Level 1 literacy levels.  Level 1 is defined as knowing the alphabet but having difficulties with reading. Pre-Level 1 is defined as being unable to read simple words but with the ability to write their names or know the alphabet. More than twice as many prisoners are at the lowest level compared with the population generally. Given this deficit, literacy work is a priority element in prison education and every effort is made to publicise literacy classes and encourage as many prisoners as possible to participate. </P>
        <P>Prisoners coming into the Education Centre of each prison have  an individual interview to assess their educational needs and interests. Those with literacy difficulties are prioritised for support. They are encouraged to participate in non-academic pursuits to enhance their percep<Col N="701"/>tion of school and education, and to stimulate a general interest in learning. Once their personal self confidence grows they are proactively encouraged to participate in courses which require increased emphasis on the use of text and written format.</P>
        <P>Following on the recommendations of the 2003 survey a number of significant initiatives commenced or were strengthened in the prisons. These initiatives parallel efforts to address adult literacy in the community. Among these are the fuller use of negotiated learning plans for all literacy students, introducing and supporting the FETAC level 1 and level 2 courses, the introduction of a standardised assessment framework across all prisons, devising and delivering the national 30-hour Initial Tutor Training course  for new teachers and developing and rolling out a national Literacy Plan for Prison Education &mdash; work on which commenced in 2009. There are currently no plans to undertake a further survey.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As the Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and do not have the option of refusing committals.  It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 352.  This represents over 9% of a rise in the number in custody.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  Since 1997 in excess of 1,720 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system.  These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the D&oacute;chas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise and Castlerea prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.</P>
        <P>More recently the re-opening of the Separation Unit in Mountjoy provided an additional 50 spaces. Current projects will see a further 200 prison spaces provided in the short term by means of a new block in Wheatfield  Prison.    In addition, work is expected to commence in late 2010 on a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prisons complex which will provide 300 prison spaces.</P>
        <P>Of course, in the longer term the Thornton campus will provide modern, regime focussed accommodation and combined with the Kilworth development &mdash; replacing Cork Prison &mdash; the State will have provided for significant, quantifiable improvements across our prison estate.</P>

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in April 2008.</P>
        <P>All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of the application has commenced and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P><Col N="705"/>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

In this regard, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to have any involvement with an individual application.</P>
        <P>However to be of assistance in the matter, I have had enquiries made with the Tribunal in relation to the application referred to by the Deputy and I understand that the application in question has been the subject of ongoing correspondence between the Applicant&rsquo;s solicitor and the Tribunal.

	<P>As the Deputy is aware the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 entered into force in July last year.  This legislation represents additional legislative resources that the Oireachtas has made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to facilitate them in their fight against serious and organised crime.  Given the serious nature of the offences dealt with under the legislation in question a full and thorough investigation of individuals and their activities is necessary and must be conducted before charges can be brought against them.  Where there is justification and a legal basis, those suspected of involvement in criminal activity are arrested, detained and questioned in relation to specific crimes.  I am advised that as a result of investigations focussing on the activities of those involved in organised crime a number of Garda investigation files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for direction.</P>
        <P>Relevant statistics in relation to the utilisation of the legislation referred to by the Deputy will be compiled in the context of seeking the renewal of certain of its provisions later this year.  I can assure this House that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to utilise all resources available to them in order to combat the activities of those engaged in criminality of all forms.  As Minister, I remain fully committed to supporting Gardai in their ongoing efforts and will ensure that the necessary resources are made available as and when they may be required.</P>

        <Quest>  the number of occasions on which evidence which was collected under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 has been used by the Garda in court; the number of convictions that have been secured by the use of such evidence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 provides a statutory framework for evidence obtained by means of covert surveillance to be used in criminal trials. The Act provides for a system of authorisations for covert surveillance operations which will, as a rule, involve an application to a judge for authorisation to proceed with the surveillance and where the reasons for the surveillance will be clearly set out before the court.</P>
        <P>Section 15, Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act, 2009 stipulates that the existence or non-existence of an authorisation shall not be disclosed by way of discovery, or otherwise, unless authorised by the court. Section 15 further states that such a disclosure shall not be authorised if it is likely to create a material risk to the maintenance of the integrity, effectiveness and security of the operations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Our criminal law has been significantly strengthened in recent years. Many of the changes which I have piloted through the Oireachtas are targeted at fighting gangland crime, including the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act, 2009 and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act, 2009.</P>
        <P>I have consistently made it clear that inevitably it will take time for the full effects of anti-gangland legislation to become clear.  The Commissioner has assured the me that the Garda&iacute; have been making full use of the legislation since it has been enacted, to build up criminal cases against gangland figures.  They are painstakingly working to gather evidence that will be sufficient to enable the DPP to initiate prosecutions of people in relation to gangland activities.  A number of Garda investigation files have already been submitted to the DPP.  I am confident that, as the evidence accumulates against individuals, successful prosecutions will be taken.</P>

	<P>Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.  With regard to adults, they include a warning and the making of a civil order by the court.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, up to 28 February, 2010, 1,501 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 1,140 to children.  Thirteen good behaviour contracts were <Col N="707"/>issued to children.  In addition, three civil orders (in respect of adults) and three behaviour orders (in respect of children) have been issued by the courts.</P>
        <P>In setting up the regime the intention was that these interventions would address the problem behaviour.  If they succeed, there will be no need to apply to the courts for an order.  It is only if they fail to lead to a behaviour adjustment by the person in question, that a court order will be applied for.</P>
        <P>My Department is examining, in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, possible approaches to dealing with and preventing anti-social behaviour at the local level, taking into account the financial and personnel resources available to local and national agencies in the current economic environment, and the desirability of using, to the greatest extent possible, existing structures.In addition to this examination, the review of the legislative provisions currently in place is continuing.</P>

There are currently no females under the age of 18 years in custody in prisons. St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution is a closed, medium security place of detention for males aged 16 to 21 years of age and accommodates both remand and sentenced prisoners.  It contains a special unit for 16 and 17 year olds.  However, in the longer term the Irish Youth Justice Service, an executive office within my Department responsible for an integrated response to youth offending, will take responsibility for the detention facilities for all boys under 18 years of age.</P>

	<P>On 1st May 2008 a policy statement, Migration Nation, outlining the policy approach to integration was published.  Following on from that a number of arrangements are in place with local authorities and national sporting bodies to assist with addressing anti-racism and promoting integration.  In 2009, funding in the amount of &euro;430,000 was made available to sporting bodies and close to &euro;1m was made available to local authorities and I hope to continue funding of this kind subject to the availability of resources.  In addition my Office has provided funding of over &euro;1.5 million to other initiatives and programmes such as the Resettlement of Programme Refugees, the Holocaust Educational Trust and Show Racism the Red Card.  Funding is also available through the European Refugee Fund and the European Social Fund for measures to promote integration. My Office has also compiled and submitted Ireland&rsquo;s Joint Third and Fourth Report to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  This report details the measures that have been taken in recent years to address anti-racism and to promote integration.  This report is available on my Office&rsquo;s website &mdash; www.integration.ie.  I will shortly establish a Ministerial Council on Integration. This Council will be largely drawn from the migrant community in this country. Such a Council, I believe, will further enhance integration in Ireland.   </P>
        <P>In order to tackle racist behaviour and to promote integration in our schools, a number of initiatives are taking place.  The Board of Management of each school is required to prepare a code of behaviour in accordance with Section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.  Each school must have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.  Research shows that in many schools codes of behaviour explicitly deal with racial harassment.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the &ldquo;Intercultural Education Guidelines&rdquo; for primary and post-primary schools developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and made available to all schools aim to promote equality and human rights, challenge unfair discrimination and promote <Col N="709"/>the values on which equality is built.  A national intercultural education strategy is being finalised and is expected to be launched in the near future.  This will deal with intercultural education right across the education spectrum including at school level.  It will set out a policy framework for the field of intercultural education.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my detailed reply to Dail Question number 200 of 26th November, 2009.  I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for subsidiary protection, and for temporary leave to remain in the state, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.  However, if new information or circumstances have come to light, which have a direct bearing on his case and which have arisen since the original decision to deport was made, there remains the option of applying to me for revocation of his Deportation Order pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended. However I wish to make clear that such an <Col N="711"/>application would require substantial grounds to be successful.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 162 of Tuesday 16 June, 2009 and the written Reply to that Question.  The position in the State of the person concerned now falls to be considered for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

        <Quest> the areas within the Millennium Development Goals set by world leaders in 2000 on which significant progress has been made; and the areas in which progress has been a disappointment to him; the steps he plans to take to get these ambitions back on track; and if he has given an international commitment that there will be no further slippage in overseas development aid targets in the coming years </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted by Heads of Government at the Millennium Summit in 2000 provide the framework for international development up to 2015. They involve a series of ambitious and far-reaching commitments, together with a set of specific targets against which to measure progress in the reduction of global poverty. Progress on the Goals will be reviewed at a Summit Meeting at the United Nations in New York in September, where Ireland and our EU partners will work to ensure that the international community maintains its commitments in the face of increased global challenges and continuing international economic difficulty.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>The UN Secretary General last month published a report on progress achieved on each of the eight Millennium Development Goals. The report notes that significant progress has been made since 2000 in combating extreme poverty and hunger in some regions, in improving levels <Col N="712"/>of enrolment in schools and in child health. There has also been progress in expanding access to clean water and access to HIV treatment and in controlling malaria and tuberculosis.</P>
        <P>Despite these achievements, however, it is clear that overall progress on the Goals has been too slow if there is to be a credible prospect of reaching the targets established for 2015. In sub-Saharan Africa, which is the premier focus of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, extreme poverty and hunger has increased. Over one billion people worldwide are now suffering the effects of hunger. More than 70 million children remain out of school and progress on gender equality has been very slow. In addition, although recent studies have demonstrated that progress is possible in relation to maternal health, the reality is that 500,000 women continue to die each year from causes that are almost entirely preventable and treatable.</P>
        <P>With just five years remaining until 2015, I believe that the attainment of the MDGs requires agreement on a practical, action-oriented development agenda, which is based on evidence. The reduction of global poverty requires a continuing commitment to the achievement of all of the MDGs.  In preparation for the Summit in September, Ireland is prioritising a focus on global hunger and food insecurity, in recognition that slow progress on the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, the first of the MDGs, is impeding progress across the other Goals. Ireland will also argue that priority be given to those regions and groups that are lagging behind, in particular those most vulnerable to extreme poverty and hunger in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
        <P>We are engaged in detailed discussions with our EU partners in order to finalise a strong EU position for the Summit, which will be approved by the June European Council. Nationally, we are also preparing with the US Administration for the organisation of an important Irish &mdash; US event during the Summit to promote a comprehensive international approach to the global hunger crisis. This will highlight the need to link agriculture, food security and nutrition programming in order to provide a realistic and sustainable solution to world hunger.</P>
        <P>The provision of Official Development Assistance (ODA) is an essential element in the effort to achieve the MDGs. The Government remains firmly committed to achieving the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2015. Ireland is ahead of most of our EU partners in making progress towards achieving the target. The OECD confirmed last week that, in 2009, Ireland was the seventh most generous aid donor internationally in per capita terms.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to reports of intimidation in Rwanda in the run-up to the presidential elections in August 2010; if he will be sending election observers; the other actions he has taken or will take to address this issue at diplomatic and European levels; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[14504/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The immediate context for reported incidents of intimidation is the run-up to Presidential elections which will be held in Rwanda on 9th August this year. The main political party in Rwanda is the RPF, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, chaired by President Kagame, which has a large majority in government. There are many smaller parties which work in coalition with the RPF and do not have strong identities of their own. Two parties which were formed as opposition parties in the early 1990s, the Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Party, are now associated at parliamentary, ministerial and institutional level with the RPF. </P><Col N="713"/>
        <P>The Social Party-Imberakuri (PS) is so far the only registered opposition party. Two other parties are trying to register, the United Democratic Forces (UDF)&ndash;Inkingi, led by Ms Victoire Ingabire who returned from exile in the Netherlands earlier this year; and the Democratic Green party of Rwanda (DGPR) led by Frank Habineza. Both these leaders have experienced problems registering their parties. The leaders also claim that they have been subjected to threats, harassment and various forms of intimidation. The government has robustly denied all allegations, and suggested there are technical reasons for the problems faced by parties in securing registration.</P>
        <P>Rwanda has made substantial progress in establishing peace, security and institutions of governance since the genocide of 1994. Although facing serious threat from FDLR Hutu rebels (many of them linked to the 1994 genocide) operating in east of neighbouring Congo, Rwanda has substantially restored security and stability within its borders. It has worked to improve relations with the authorities in Kinshasa as evidenced by the restoration of diplomatic relations and the recent regional cooperation in the military operation against the FDLR. Rwanda has also won praise from international donors over the past several years for its progressive approach to development and for having created strong levels of economic growth.</P>
        <P>Whilst the progress made by Rwanda is to be welcomed, there are concerns about political freedom, particularly in advance of the elections. As a result of the 1994 genocide, a law was passed in 2008 which criminalises &ldquo;genocidal ideology&rdquo;. Whilst a law of this kind is understandable in such circumstances, the terms of the law are vague and ambiguous, and as a result are capable of stifling freedom of expression and narrowing political space. Some of the regulations in force could be interpreted as aimed at controlling political competition and are not in line with international standards.</P>
        <P>With regard to election monitoring, Ireland always seeks to respond in a positive manner to calls from the EU for election observers. However on this occasion it is envisaged that the EU will field an Election Expert Team rather than a full Election Observation Mission. However, if a request for observers should issue we would examine the request positively.</P>
        <P>Together with our EU partners, Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Rwanda in advance of, during, and after the elections. We shall continue to make our voice heard, through our Embassy in Kampala which is accredited to Rwanda, and through those EU partners who have missions in Kigali and have regular dialogue with the Government. Ireland will continue to support Rwanda&rsquo;s development through the provision of overseas development aid and bilateral cooperation. Irish Aid has provided more than &euro;8 million in funding to Rwanda since 2007.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Passport Office provides a comprehensive range of options for citizens to apply for passports. In addition to the public counter service in Dublin and Cork applications may be made by express post through some 1,000 post offices across the country and some 70 post<b></b>offices in Northern Ireland. While the originally guaranteed 10 working day service is not currently available applications are being processed in a first come first served basis. Less urgent applications can also be made by ordinary post. </P>
        <P>The current problems being encountered in the passport office are a direct result of industrial action over recent months and a 24% increase on applications for this time of year. My Depart<Col N="714"/>ment is working to meet the demand and is issuing passports between 15 and 20 working days from date of receipt. Continued refusal of the Civil, Public and Services Union to co-operate with temporary seasonal staff is hindering the ability to reduce these timelines. Notwithstanding the current financial pressures on my Department, I am keeping the issue of additional regional passport offices under review</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I became Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have set as a key priority for my Department the promotion of our economic interests abroad. I have charged the Promoting Ireland Abroad Division of the Department, as well as our Missions abroad, to work closely with the relevant Government Departments and economic State Agencies to assist trade, investment and tourism efforts and to convey positive messages about our economic policies and performance, in order to enhance our image overseas as an economic partner. </P>
        <P>Since the launch of the Government&rsquo;s Smart Economy Framework in December 2008, my Department has placed a special emphasis on raising awareness of Ireland as a centre of excellence for science, technology and innovation. The issue is regularly raised on the occasion of inward and outward high level visits, during bilateral consultations and exchanges and in the context of promotional work by my Department.</P>
        <P>As part of its promotional work, my Department has also devoted considerable energy over the last 18 months to conveying positive messages to international media and opinion formers about our economic performance. At my direction, a Media Unit was established for this purpose within the Department&rsquo;s Promoting Ireland Abroad Division last year. The Unit works closely with our Missions abroad to proactively counter negative and inaccurate reporting of our economic situation, and to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s strengths as an economic partner, including in the field of innovation.</P>
        <P>My Department also works closely with the economic State Agencies to ensure that a consistent message about Ireland&rsquo;s strengths and advantages is communicated to the international business community. Ireland&rsquo;s growing reputation for excellence in innovation is at the heart of these efforts. This year, in order to maximise the value of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day as an opportunity to promote our economic interests abroad, a coherent set of messages was developed in close consultation with the relevant Government Departments and State Agencies. These were used by all Ministers travelling abroad for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and by our Ambassadors in other countries. Central to these messages was the development of Ireland as a global hub for innovation as a key part of the Government&rsquo;s strategy for economic recovery.</P>
        <P>In February I launched the Global Irish Network, a project first proposed at the Global Irish Economic Forum in September, as a means of continuing and maintaining the valuable work that was begun at Farmleigh. Members are located all over the world, with significant numbers drawn from Europe, North America and Asia. There are also members in the Middle East, Australia, and Latin America. While our Embassies and State Agencies have actively maintained local business and community networks in individual countries and regions, the Global Irish Network will, for the first time, integrate the most influential Irish connected individuals into one global group and act as an additional resource for the Government and State Agencies in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s economic, cultural and tourism messages in key markets.</P><Col N="715"/>
        <P>The report of the Taskforce on Innovation provides a detailed and constructive examination of where Ireland currently stands in relation to innovation and sets out a series of recommendations aimed at achieving a step-change in Ireland&rsquo;s innovation performance. My Department will continue to work closely with the relevant Government Departments and State Agencies to promote Ireland&rsquo;s achievements and potential in innovation and to ensure that optimal use is made of Ireland&rsquo;s network of Missions abroad to promote and advance Ireland&rsquo;s interests in this crucial area.</P>

	<P>During my visit to Egypt in February I raised this case with the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs. I emphasised the fact that this abduction is causing great distress to the child&rsquo;s family in Ireland and sought the assistance of the Minister to resolve this case in a speedy manner. In a follow-up to this meeting the Embassy in Cairo submitted a note to the Egyptian Foreign Ministry outlining the facts of the case. </P>
        <P>The Embassy in Cairo has been assisting the family in relation to this case since last Summer. The family has engaged solicitors in Egypt and Dublin to pursue this case in the Egyptian courts. I understand that at present the solicitor advising the family in Egypt is awaiting documents from the family in Ireland and confirmation from them that they wish to retain his services so that he begin to progress matters in the Egyptian Courts.</P>
        <P>Our Embassy in Cairo can follow-up on this matter with Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Ministry for Justice is Egypt once the intentions of the family in relation to court proceedings in Egypt become clear.</P>

	<P>The Government is deeply concerned at the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The effects of the ongoing blockade were witnessed at first hand by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Miche&aacute;l Martin TD, during his humanitarian visit to Gaza in February of this year. </P>
        <P>Since Minister Martin&rsquo;s visit the Gaza Power Plant has ceased operation due to a lack of fuel. This will further affect the population&rsquo;s access to vital services, including water supplies, and may also result in the suspension of work in vital sectors such as health, sanitation and education.</P><Col N="716"/>
        <P>These developments can only worsen the situation of the local population, 60 per cent of whom are food insecure, with 20,000 displaced from their homes as a result of last year&rsquo;s conflict.</P>
        <P>The Government has responded to the ongoing crisis by more than doubling our support for the Palestinian people through our official overseas development programme, Irish Aid. We allocated a total of &euro;10.3 million in 2009, including emergency funding of &euro;1.5 million in response to the humanitarian consequences of the Operation Cast Lead early last year. This response underlies our continuing commitment to meeting the emergency needs of the Palestinian people as we have done of many years.</P>
        <P>Ireland has also provided &euro;17.7 million in funding since 2005 to the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), the largest single recipient of our support for the Palestinian people. Ireland recently announced a three year commitment to UNRWA&rsquo;s General Fund of &euro;12 million. 2009 was a particularly difficult year for UNRWA in Gaza, where approximately 70 per cent of the total population of 1.5 million are refugees.</P>
        <P>Other agencies operating in Gaza which receive Irish funding include the Humanitarian Response Fund for the Palestinian People which is administered by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR). The Humanitarian Response Fund for the Palestinian People is used to support the emergency response operations of NGOs and UN agencies. It has assisted a variety of projects in Gaza in the aftermath of last year&rsquo;s Israeli military action, ranging from school rehabilitation, to mine clearance, to the repair of fishing boats. Irish Aid provided support of &euro;500,000 to the Fund in 2009. PCHR, which is based in Gaza City, is one of eight Palestinian and Israeli civil society organisations funded by Ireland through our Human Rights and Democratisation funding scheme. The Centre, considered the leading human rights organisation in Gaza, is dedicated to protecting human rights, promoting the rule of law and upholding democratic principles in the Palestinian Territories.</P>
        <P>The Government is closely monitoring the situation in Gaza and will continue to provide support to its people in the face of the ongoing humanitarian crisis.</P>

	<P>There has been a United States embargo on Cuba since 1962.  The EU has a longstanding position on the US embargo, most recently expressed in the EU Presidency statement on 28 October 2009 during the debate in the General Assembly on the resolution on the &ldquo; Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba&rdquo;. In this statement, the EU Presidency said that while it believed that the United States&rsquo; trade policy towards Cuba is fundamentally a bilateral issue, American legislation such as the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Helms-Burton Act of 1996 had extended the effects of the US&rsquo; embargo to third-party countries. As a matter of principle the European Union firmly and continuously opposes such extraterritorial measures and   rejects all unilateral measures directed against Cuba that are contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade.</P>

	<P>Addressing HIV and AIDS, which has destroyed the lives of millions of men, women and children, is of fundamental importance to the reduction of global poverty.  AIDS remains a leading cause of death in many developing countries.  Over 22 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with HIV. </P>
        <P>This year, under the aid programme managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Government will spend over &euro;100 million in combating HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases.  Of this, over &euro;42 million will be spent on HIV, AIDS and communicable diseases in those countries most affected by the pandemic.  This includes some &euro;14.8 million in Mozambique, &euro;6.97 million in Tanzania, &euro;6.4 million in Uganda, &euro;3.95 million in Lesotho, &euro;3.85 million in Ethiopia, &euro;3.24 million in Zambia, &euro;1.5 million in Zimbabwe and &euro;1.4 million in South Africa.  Our support assists National AIDS Councils, health ministries, non-government service providers and civil society in providing prevention, treatment, care and support programmes.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a strong international reputation for our commitment to the fight against HIV and AIDS and we play an active role in shaping international policy. Our particular focus is on protecting the interests of the worst affected countries and the most vulnerable populations.  An estimated &euro;9.2 million will also be provided this year to assist United Nations programmes in targeting AIDS and communicable diseases at national level.</P>
        <P>The Government places a strong emphasis on ensuring that international best practice informs policy and programming, through our funding for key global partnerships and critical research areas.  A total of &euro;20.9 million will be allocated by Irish Aid to Global Health and AIDS initiatives this year.  This includes support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, a partnership that has had an impressive impact on communities most severely affected.  We will also continue to support a regional AIDS programme in southern Africa and the further development of new products to prevent HIV transmission.  We will build on assistance provided to UNAIDS to improve the international response to AIDS in humanitarian settings.</P>
        <P>This year over &euro;24 million in funding will be provided through the Irish Aid programme to support the work of civil society partners in dealing with HIV, AIDS and communicable diseases.  This includes an allocation of over &euro;14 million to Irish non-governmental organisations through the Multi-Annual Programme Scheme.  The valuable work of these organisations includes vital community-level support which complements other Irish Aid assistance.</P>
        <P>We recognise that AIDS and communicable diseases have a particularly devastating impact in emergency and recovery situations.  In 2010 an estimated &euro;9 million will be spent on efforts to address these diseases in such settings.  This will include support to frontline work in the fragile states of Sierra Leone and Liberia.</P>

	<P>The first indication we received of the use of false Irish passports in connection with the killing of Mr. Mahmoud al Mabhouh was on 4 February, when local press reports in Dubai stated that several suspects were believed to have entered Dubai on Irish passports.  The Ambassador of Ireland to the United Arab Emir<Col N="720"/>ates, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Madden, immediately contacted the UAE Foreign Ministry to seek clarification as to the truth of these reports.  On 8 February, Ambassador Madden was received at the UAE Foreign Ministry and was informed that they had no information at that time but that the matter was under investigation by the UAE&rsquo;s security services.</P>
        <P>On 15 February, the Dubai Chief of Police gave a news conference during which he gave the details of fake Irish passports.  My Department, in cooperation with the Garda&iacute; and the security services, immediately commenced an investigation into the apparent use of fraudulent Irish passports, including by making contact with the Irish citizens whose passport numbers had been stolen.  I have discussed the matter with the UAE Foreign Minister and have assured him of Ireland&rsquo;s cooperation.  The Attorney General took the opportunity presented by his St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to the UAE to discuss the issue with the Foreign Minister.</P>
        <P>Ambassador Madden has maintained ongoing contact with the UAE Foreign Ministry and the Dubai Police, in addition to liaising with his German, French, Australian, Austrian and British counterparts. Ambassador Madden has met with the UAE Minister for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed to discuss the situation.  The Dubai police have shared with us the details of the fraudulent passports they suspect were used, and we have passed these on to the investigating Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>Officials from our Embassies in Paris, London and Berlin have been in contact with the Foreign Ministries of those countries to ensure a coordinated response. Senior officials of my Department have also met on two occasions with the Australian Ambassador to Ireland and shared information with him.  I have discussed the situation on a number of occasions with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and we are cooperating closely and sharing information.  On 22 March, the British Foreign Office briefed our Embassy in London to the effect that the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) investigation had found &ldquo;compelling circumstantial evidence&rdquo; of Israeli involvement in the production of false British passports.  On foot of the findings, the British government requested that a member of staff of the Israeli embassy in London be withdrawn.  Our own investigations, both by this Department and by the Garda&iacute;, are ongoing.</P>
        <P>I have already, on 22 February, met with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, in Brussels to outline how seriously we take the misuse of Irish passports.  Our Ambassador to Israel also met with the Europe Director of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and registered Ireland&rsquo;s serious concerns.  The Israeli Ambassador to Ireland was invited to Iveagh House where senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs stressed the seriousness with which the Government viewed the matter.</P>
        <P>It is simply unacceptable that totally innocent Irish citizens could have been endangered through this fraudulent use of Irish passports.  The consequences of innocent Irish citizens being implicated in the murder of a Hamas commander could have been extremely serious.</P>
        <P>Our primary focus in all of this has been to guarantee the security of the Irish citizens affected.  There are now a total of eight confirmed false Irish passports in question.  We have spoken to all of the citizens who hold or have held passports with numbers provided by the Dubai authorities, and we have provided them with new passports.</P>
        <P>At the February Foreign Affairs Council, EU Foreign Ministers strongly condemned the fact that those involved in this action have used fraudulent EU Member States&rsquo; passports and credit cards acquired through the theft of EU citizens&rsquo; identities.  As stressed in the past, notably in <Col N="721"/>March 2004, by EU Heads of State and Government at the European Council, the European Union has consistently opposed extra-judicial killings, which are contrary to international law.</P>

	<P>I refer to Parliamentary Question No. 507 of 23 March 2010 and am now happy to be in a position to provide costs as requested by the Deputy. </P>
        <P>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day offers a unique opportunity to raise Ireland&rsquo;s profile, promote our interests overseas, to strengthen bilateral relations, provide support for Irish communities abroad and to deepen the connection with our Diaspora.</P>
        <P>There is an unparalleled level of media and public attention on the Irish and Ireland around St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and the media coverage this year demonstrated a very favourable disposition towards Ireland as a business partner, as a source of unique culture and as a destination for tourism.</P>
        <P>Ministers visited 16 of our main trading partners, as well as significant emerging markets in Europe and Asia and were asked to place special emphasis on promoting Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests abroad through direct support for the State Agencies and through conveying a unified message about the Government&rsquo;s programme of economic recovery.</P>
        <P>My Department is fully compliant with the Department of Finance guidelines on foreign travel.  My Department also operates its own detailed internal travel guidelines and practises which ensure cost effective travel practises, both in Headquarters and throughout our network of 75 diplomatic missions abroad.  The central aim of the Departmental travel policy, which embraces both Ministers and officials, is to minimise official travel costs and to achieve value for money for expenditure necessarily incurred, consistent with the effective discharge of official duties.</P>
        <P>Details of costs incurred by my Department in respect of official travel for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day March 2010 are set out below.  I travelled to Washington and was accompanied by the Secretary General of my Department and three officials:</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 619 and 620 together.</P>
        <P>Government support for the horse and greyhound racing industries is provided under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, which was established under Section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001.</P>
        <P>Funding of both Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon supports two very important productive industries and helps to sustain the important role of horse and greyhound breeding and training enterprises in the development of the rural economy.  These industries, together, account for an estimated 27,500 direct jobs, generate very substantial economic activity and make a vital contribution to the rural economy including farm incomes.</P>
        <P>The funding given to the greyhound racing sector helps in sustaining a tradition that has existed for hundreds of years and in underpinning the economic activity in what are, in many instances, less affluent regions of the country.  The funding has also contributed significantly to the almost &euro;90 million that has been invested in the improved facilities now available at greyhound tracks around Ireland.</P><Col N="723"/>
        <P>The funding has allowed Horse Racing Ireland to undertake a capital investment programme that has underpinned growth in the sector.  The funding has allowed Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horse racing.   &euro;59.3m has been allocated to the Fund for 2010. In order to give effect to this Estimates allocation it was necessary, under the relevant provisions of the Horse and Greyhound Act, 2001, to have the increase in the Horse and Greyhound Fund specified in a regulation.  The Horse &amp; Greyhound Fund Regulation 2010 was approved in the Dail and Seanad on 4 February 2010.</P>
        <P>A review of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund has been completed.  The report states that, while not all aspects of the total contribution of the sector can be definitively quantified, there is adequate direct and indirect evidence to support a strong argument that the horse and greyhound racing industries constitute a major source of direct and indirect employment, give rise to considerable domestic and export earnings and are a key driver of substantial economic activity, especially in rural areas.</P>
        <P>The report maintains that any sharp withdrawal or curtailment of funding in the short-term would likely have major detrimental impacts on the industries involved with the consequent risk of undoing much of what has been achieved since the Fund came into existence in 2001.  At least in the medium term these industries need secure State support.  If this was not available, employment would fall, infrastructural development would not take place, the product would deteriorate, integrity would become compromised and the industries would be seriously undermined.</P>
        <P>When the Fund was established it was estimated that it would be fully financed from the Excise duty on off-course betting.  When the Fund commenced the rate of duty was 5%, but the rate was subsequently reduced to 1%.  Any shortfall in the amount generated by the Excise duty is made up by direct Exchequer subvention.</P>
        <P>Excise duty on off-course betting has been 1% since 1 July 2006.  The gap between what is raised through the off-course betting duty and the amount to be provided for the Fund under the provisions of the Horse and Greyhound racing Act, 2001 continues to be met directly from the Exchequer.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance has stated that it is his intention to widen, if possible, the tax base on which betting duty would be applied.  Bets placed either online or over the phone are generally with out-of-State companies so applying betting duty is therefore problematic.  However, officials from the Department of Finance, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are looking at the scope to overcome legal and operational difficulties in this area.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department of Finance is working closely with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has initiated a review in order to provide the Government with options for a new and comprehensive legal and organisational framework governing gambling architecture in the State.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that on March 23rd the Taoiseach announced that responsibility for these industries is to be transferred over to my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  In that regard a regulation has been drafted with the view to the transfer taking place with effect from early May.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As stated in response to questions answered on the 31 March on this subject, most of the resultant changes from the re-naming of the Department will be implemented in-house by the existing staff of the Department.  These include work on the Department&rsquo;s website, changing email addresses and re-titling the Department&rsquo;s customer charter.  Provision had already been made this year for the purchase of new headed paper which is required under the Department&rsquo;s Irish Language Scheme.  The Department is currently holding stocks of headed stationery valued at approximately &euro;1,750.00.  While most of this will not be required following the change of name, it will be recycled.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that costs of approximately &euro;15,000 may arise in relation to the purchase of new name plaques and signage. This amount is estimated based on the existing signage types in use.  However, as part of the competitive tendering process to address the replacement of this signage, various alternative signage types and quotations will be considered and the final expenditure may be under this estimated amount.  These costs will be met from within the Department&rsquo;s existing Vote.</P>

	<P>I am very aware of the nuisance that can be caused to householders by door-to-door collectors of clothing and bric-a-brac.  I am also conscious that certain collectors of such items convey the impression in their promotional literature that they are charitable in nature, when this may not actually be the case.  This may lead some people to donate to such collections in the mistaken belief that they are supporting a charity.  I consider that this is unfair both to donors, whose intention in donating such goods is to help those in need and to genuine charities that are reportedly losing out on support as a result.  I firmly believe that the public should be empowered to verify the charitable <i>bona fides</i> of such collectors.</P>
        <P>At present, there is no public register of charities operating in Ireland, although the Revenue Commissioners publish a list of current &ldquo;CHY&rdquo; holders &mdash; organisations that have qualified for charitable tax exemptions &mdash; on their website, www.revenue.ie, which is publicly accessible. I would recommend that members of the public check this list if they have concerns about the authenticity of any collector.</P>
        <P>However, the Charities Act 2009, which was enacted last year, will, when fully commenced, address this situation.  The cornerstone of the new statutory regulatory regime for charities will be a Charities Regulatory Authority with extensive regulatory powers, and a publicly accessible Register of Charities upon which any charity operating in Ireland must be registered.  It will be an offence for any organisation that is not on the Register of Charities to describe itself or its activities in such a way as to lead the public to assume that the organisation is a registered charity.  This will limit the scope for non-charities to suggest that they are charitable in nature. <Col N="728"/> By checking the Register, the public will be in a position to distinguish between charitable and non-charitable collections, and to make better-informed decisions about which collections they choose to support.</P>
        <P>The setting up of the Register of Charities is contingent upon the new Authority being in place. My Department is rolling out an implementation plan for the Act at the moment. In other countries, for example, Scotland, it has taken a number of years after enactment of the legislation for the new regulatory system for charities to be fully introduced, and this will be the case in Ireland too.</P>

        <P>I want to confirm to the Deputies that the Office of the Minister for Drugs (OMD) remains very much in operation with a clear focus on dealing with the issue of problem drug use in Ireland.  Furthermore, I can confirm that responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy will rest with me, as Minister.</P>
        <P>The Government remains fully committed to addressing the drugs problem and I believe that my appointment as a Minister &mdash; with direct responsibility in this area &mdash; will facilitate the implementation of the Strategy in a timely and co-ordinated fashion.  Indeed, there have been many people calling for some time for the Minister with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy to be a member of the Government, with a seat at Cabinet.</P>
        <P>During my previous period as Minister for State with responsibility for this area, significant steps forward were made in the drugs area.  From my experience on the ground at that time, I am very familiar with the ongoing issues in terms of the drugs problem in communities and the initiatives being taken to address them.</P><Col N="731"/>
        <P>I acknowledge the excellent work done by my colleague, Mr John Curran, T.D., while he was Minister of State, in driving the finalisation of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, the implementation of which is being pursued vigorously across a range of Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>I fully intend to build on this work and to implement a continuous assessment approach to progress on the 63 Actions in the Strategy to ensure that we achieve successful outcomes.   Furthermore, I believe that the structures now in place under the Strategy will better facilitate me to effectively fulfil that role.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputies of my commitment to press ahead with the ongoing implementation of the Drugs Strategy and also to support the timely finalisation and subsequent implementation of the Substance Misuse Strategy, incorporating both alcohol and drugs.</P>

	<P>In order to ensure the continued relevance of the RAPID Programme, a review of RAPID area boundaries, including an analysis of data from Census 2006 across a range of socioeconomic and deprivation indicators, has been undertaken with the intention of allowing adjustments necessary to ensure that areas are appropriately targeting the most disadvantaged communities.  Following the review, the Government approved the inclusion of five new towns in the RAPID Programme in May last &mdash; Ballina, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Mullingar and Rathkeale.  The review also proposed changes to the boundaries of some of the other 46 RAPID areas, including Dublin 12.  In this regard, each local Area Implementation Team was requested to examine the proposals and to either confirm their agreement or to make suggestions for amendments, based on their local knowledge.  This work is continuing and a number of areas have requested amendments, which are currently being examined. I intend to bring proposals to Government regarding the boundary changes when this process is completed. </P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 643 and 647 together.  </P>
        <P>I share the concerns outlined by the Deputies in relation to the activities of headshops and the new psychoactive substances, represented as legal highs, which are being sold in these outlets.  These concerns primarily relate to the potential health hazards arising from the use of these products and the possibility that their use may act as a gateway to the use of illicit drugs.  I am also aware that the use of these products has lead to people presenting to the Accidents and Emergency Departments of some hospitals.</P>
        <P>The National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 includes two actions aimed at addressing the issues involved.  Action 14 calls for the monitoring of the activities of headshops and all businesses involved in the sale of psychoactive substances, with the objective of ensuring that no illegal activity is undertaken and for appropriate steps to be taken to reform legislation in this area where it is deemed to be appropriate.  Action 15 recommends that drugs-related legislation be kept under continuous review, with a particular focus on new synthetic substances and new or changed uses of psychoactive substances, against the background of EU and broader international experience and best practice.</P>
        <P>Through the Misuse of Drugs Act &mdash; which is the primary legislation through which these substances can be regulated &mdash; the Department of Health and Children has drafted regulations to introduce controls on a range of substances.  These regulations will make the possession and sale of these substances illegal and subject to criminal sanctions.  In line with a recent Government decision, the draft regulations have been notified to the European Commission under the relevant Technical Standards Directives, as controls under the Misuse of Drugs Act involve a restriction on trade.  It is envisaged that the regulations controlling the various substances will come into effect at the conclusion of the three month process involved.  In preparing the required regulations, the Department of Health and Children consulted with the relevant authorities to ensure that any legitimate uses of the substances involved are not impinged upon.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, a number of other measures are also in train:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the activities of headshops are being closely monitored on an ongoing basis by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service, with a view to ensuring that no substances that are currently illegal are being sold;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the HSE, in association with partner agencies under the Drugs Strategy, is finalising a national drugs awareness campaign that will focus on the dangers of psychoactive substances available through headshops; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the National Advisory Committee on Drugs has been asked to carry out some targeted research in this area.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">My Department has also been in contact with the Attorney General about a range of possible approaches to the matter and a number of issues arising in that context, including possible legislative proposals, are being actively considered at senior level within an inter-departmental framework.</P>

	<P>My Department is aware of the concerns of a number of groups following the decision to withdraw funding from the organisation in question and is working with Pobal to secure arrangements so that the area will continue to receive the necessary resources from a range of relevant programmes.  In this respect, Pobal has recently met with all of the community groups directly funded by the organisation in question and will, in the short term, now directly manage the funding of their work.  Groups have been assured that this initial funding will continue until a long-term resolution is found to the management of the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) in the area.  In the meantime, my Department will continue to directly fund all Community Development Projects under the LCDP in the area so that the services and supports they provide to their local communities can be maintained.  Discussions with F&Aacute;S are also underway on ensuring non-disruptive continuation of Local Employment Service (LES) operations in the area.  It will be entirely a matter for the Board of the organisation in question, as an independent limited company, to decide whether to close or to remain open.</P>

	<P>In recognition of the devastation suffered by people in many areas of the country as a result of the flooding from November 2009 onwards the Government set up a humanitarian assistance scheme to provide income tested financial support to people who have suffered damages to their homes not covered by insurance.  An initial sum of &euro;10million was set aside by the Government for this purpose.  The HSE&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service has been providing support to households under the humanitarian assistance scheme since last November&rsquo;s flooding.  Up to the 9 April 2010 they had made 2,809 payments to 1,259 individuals to the value of &euro;1,100,616 throughout the country.  However, it is the nature of spend in such cases that submissions in relation to <Col N="736"/>more expensive items could take some time. It is, therefore, too early to make any predictions in relation to the final spend.  People seeking assistance should contact their local Community Welfare Office. Further information and applications forms in relation to the humanitarian assistance scheme are available from the Community Welfare Service in the affected areas and from the Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.welfare.ie</i>, and the HSE&rsquo;s website,<i> www.hse.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The reckonable earnings of employees for PRSI purposes are defined as earnings derived from insurable employment and insurable (occupational injuries) employment.  This definition is clarified in regulations as relating, in most circumstances, to anything assessable to income tax under Schedule E of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  Under income tax rules, subject to certain limits, amounts contributed by employees to occupational pension schemes are exempt from income tax.  Therefore they do not fall within the charge to PRSI.  A contribution payable under the PRSI system is usually comprised of an employee portion and an employer portion.  Nonetheless the contribution is a single payment.  On this basis where a payment is excepted from the charge to social insurance this exception applies equally to the employee and employer portions.  Exempting pension contributions from tax and social insurance is consistent with Government policy of ensuring the adequacy of retirement incomes and the long-term sustainability of our pensions systems.</P>

The relevant tax year is that which falls two years prior to the year in which the claim is made.  As such, a person applying for Treatment Benefit in 2010 would be required to have a total of 260 paid PRSI contributions since first starting work, and either (i) 39 paid or credited PRSI contributions in 2008, OR (ii) 26 paid PRSI contributions in both 2008 and 2007.

The benefits <Col N="738"/>currently available under the scheme are, from January 1 2010, limited to a free Optical and Dental Examination, together with a grant towards the cost of Hearing aid appliances. </P>

Advocacy services are provided through a Community and Voluntary programme involving 46 projects which focuses on representative advocacy for people with disabilities.  The Citizens Information Board also provides advocacy through the Citizens Information Services focusing on access to services, welfare entitlements and employment rights.  This type of mainstream advocacy is open to people with disabilities and the Community and Voluntary Sector Advocacy programme has created close links with the Citizens Information Services to ensure that people with disabilities are encouraged and supported to use the mainstream services where possible. People can access information and advocacy services on the Citizens Information website (<i>www.citizensinformation.ie </i>); by phoning the Citizens Information Phone Service (CIPS), which operates Mon-Fri 9am to 9pm, (LoCall 1890 777121) ; or by dropping in to the network of 42 Citizens Information Services which provides face-to-face services to the public in 111 Citizens Information Centres nationally.</P>
        <P>Since July 2009 the Board has responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). The MABS assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 52 independent MABS companies operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country, with national support provided by the MABS NDL. In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline (1890 283438) is available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at <i>www.mabs.ie.</i>  I am satisfied that the Citizens Information Board, and MABS, meets the needs of people who require information, advice, and advocacy, including those with disabilities and I have no plans to extend these services to include the nomination of medical doctors.</P>

	<P>In order to qualify for Domiciliary Care Allowance a child must have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.  An application for Domiciliary Care Allowance was received from the person in question on the 14 December 2009.  This application was referred to one of the Departments Medical Assessors who examined the case on the 19th <Col N="739"/>January 2010 and advised that the child in question was not medically eligible for Domiciliary Care Allowance.  A letter issued to the person in question on the 12th February 2010 where she was informed of the decision to refuse Domiciliary Care Allowance on the grounds of not satisfying the medical criteria.  In the case of an application which is refused on medical grounds, the applicant may submit additional information and/or ask for the case to be reviewed by a different Medical Assessor specially designated for this task.  Where a person is not satisfied with the decision of a Deciding Officer they may appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

	<P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs assists social welfare recipients with heating costs both through their basic payments and through the fuel allowance and the household benefits package of electricity and gas allowances.  These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.  The household benefits package is payable throughout the year to almost 380,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households to assist them with their heating, light and cooking costs.  This scheme cost approximately &euro;184m in 2009.  In addition, the national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the additional cost of their heating needs during the winter season.</P>
        <P>The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full and must be seen in the context of the overall level of income available to the family.  Proper household insulation is absolutely vital in tacking fuel poverty.  Initiatives such as the Warmer Homes Scheme, operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have a very valuable role to play in that regard, as does funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to improve the quality of existing local authority housing and the Housing Adaptation Grants for older people and people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The Government has announced its intention to introduce a carbon tax, which will come into effect on heating products from May 2010 and on solid fuels at a date to be set by commencement order.  Before the tax is applied to fuels for home heating, arrangements are being made to assist those most at risk of fuel poverty.  In his Carbon Budget Statement, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, outlined details of &euro;130 million in funding <Col N="740"/>for insulation, &euro;76 million of which will be used to assist low income families.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio and has convened an Inter-Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy to coordinate and drive Government policy in this area.  The Inter-Departmental/ Agency Group has been asked to draw up an Energy Affordability Strategy.  This strategy will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability and will have regard both to the impact of the carbon tax on low income households and the range of supports outlined above in making its recommendations.</P>

Each Order needs to be carefully drafted so that all relevant legislation is listed in the Schedule to the Order.  The departments which currently hold the functions that are being transferred to my department are fully engaged in this task at present.  The draft Orders will need to be finalised and settled in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel before they can be brought to Government. </P>
        <P>Once this process has been finalised, it is the Minister for Finance who brings the necessary Orders to Government.  At this stage, I cannot give a precise date for the formal transfer of functions as this depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of the legislation governing the particular functions.  I can assure the Deputy that everyone involved in the process, both in my own department and in the other departments concerned, is making every effort to complete it at the earliest possible date and I hope that it can be brought to conclusion within a matter of weeks.  While the primary responsibility for job creation rests with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment, my Department already has a role in supporting people from welfare to work.  The National Employment Action Plan is the main activation measure for jobseekers and provides for a systematic engagement of the employment services with unemployed people.</P>
        <P>Overall, the transfer of functions being implemented will facilitate the delivery of a more effective and streamlined response to the needs of the unemployed.  Bringing together, under the aegis of one department, the employment services of F&Aacute;S, the expertise of its Placement Officers and the unemployment services of this Department as well as the Community Employment Schemes, Job Initiative Scheme, Community Services Programme and the Rural Social Scheme will offer significant opportunities to generate synergies, improve efficiency and, ultimately, improve service delivery to those availing of those services.  The existing level of interaction and cooperation with F&Aacute;S and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment will facilitate a seamless transfer of functions when the necessary Orders are finalised and the restructuring will provide for greater cohesion of activation measures.</P>

	<P>Disability Allowance is a weekly Allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66.  The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.  The person concerned applied for and was awarded a reduced rate Disability Allowance from 14 March 2007.  The weekly rate of Disability Allowance payment depends on the amount of weekly means assessed.  The legislative provisions regarding Disability Allowance state that means will be assessed from all income which the claimant or claimant&rsquo;s spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the year following the date of their claim with certain exceptions.  The person concerned was assessed with weekly means of &euro;266.40 derived from a pension he received from the Department of Defence which is assessable as means for Disability Allowance.  Based on these means, the person qualifies for Disability Allowance at the weekly rate of &euro;99.90 effective from 6 January 2010.  If his means have decreased he should notify the Department in writing and furnish all relevant documents and his claim will be reviewed.</P>

	<P>The Family Income Supplement (FIS) is designed to provide support for people with families who are on low earnings.  This preserves the incentive for them to remain in employment in circumstances where they might only be marginally better off than if they were claiming other social welfare payments.  The person concerned made an application for family income supplement in April 2009.  As part of the process of establish household means for FIS purposes in this case, it was referred to the social welfare inspectorate to obtain details of spouse&rsquo;s self employment and to determine the claimant&rsquo;s insurable earnings and hours worked.  Unfortunately, due to an oversight <Col N="744"/>there was a delay in completing the Social Welfare Inspector&rsquo;s review of this case.

	<P>The Department has an automated system which sends out a letter to claimants four weeks in advance of their Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit exhausting. The letter sets out the claimant&rsquo;s entitlement options. Along with this notification, the Department includes an application form for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance.  The person in question is a casual worker. This automated system does not apply to casual workers <Col N="745"/>due to the nature of their casual employment in each week. Each week the local office notes the days remaining on their entitlement to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit. The local office notified the claimant at the appropriate time to make a Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance claim.</P>
        <P>The person was on Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from 3 March 2009 to 23 Dec 2009 when his claim was closed as his benefits had exhausted. He subsequently registered for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance on 3 February 2010. His Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance claim was awarded and paid. Payments were backdated to 24 December 2009. On 5 February 2010, he received &euro;862.30 for the period 24 December 2009 to 2 February 2010. On 19 February 2010, he received &euro;302 for the period 3 February to 16 February 2010.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Social welfare legislation, with certain exceptions referred to below, lies within the area of competence of the individual Member States. National legislation in such matters therefore does not require approval of the EU and does not constitute EU law. The freedom of movement for workers, enshrined in the EU Treaties, results in EU Regulations governing social security for people who have moved from one EU Member State to another for the purpose of employment, and these Regulations have direct application in every Member State. National legislation and practice must also be compatible with the other EU Treaty provisions regarding (for example) equal treatment for all EU citizens. In addition, Member States must have regard to judgements of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) which interpret and clarify the application of the EU treaties and legislation.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s guidelines on the habitual residence condition provide deciding officers with an understanding of how the national legislation and the relevant EU Regulations and <Col N="746"/>ECJ judgements should be applied. Although published on the Department&rsquo;s website in accordance with the requirements of the Freedom of Information legislation, their sole purpose and standing is the provision of guidance to the Department&rsquo;s staff. The EU Commission, which is responsible for ensuring that Community law is correctly applied, is empowered to receive and investigate complaints by EU citizens in such matters, and, if it deems it appropriate following investigation, the Commission may refer such complaints to the ECJ. In December 2004 the Commission commenced an investigation of the operation of the habitual residence condition in Ireland following the receipt of such complaints.  The investigation was closed in April 2006 when the Commission was satisfied that there was no conflict with EU law and that there were therefore no grounds for continuing infringement proceedings.</P>
        <P>The social welfare provisions regarding habitual residence refer to the Common Travel Area only in the context of the rebuttable presumption clause in subsection (1) of section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. This states that . . .&ldquo;<i>it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is shown, that a person is not habitually resident in the State at the date of the making of the application concerned unless the person has been present in the State or any other part of the Common Travel Area for a continuous period of 2 years ending on that date.&rdquo; </i> There has been no change in this provision since its introduction in May 2004.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s guidelines comment on this provision as follows:</P>
<P el="5" LI="1"><i>&ldquo;The presumption in Section 246 (1) does </i><b><i>not</i></b><i> mean that an applicant is automatically considered to be habitually resident in the State because he or she has been here (or in another part of the Common Travel Area) for 2 years or more.  The onus is always on applicants to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims for a social welfare payment. Also subsection (1) does not mean that an applicant can be automatically considered to be &ldquo;not habitually resident&rdquo; because he or she has not resided here for 2 years. In all cases it is imperative to base any such decision on the factors listed in subsection (4) . . . as habitual residence cannot be determined by reference to a period of time alone . . . &rdquo;</i></P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Guidelines also say in the context of considering the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country:</P>
<P LI="1" el="5"><i>&ldquo;Bearing in mind the presumption clause in Section 246 (1). . . ., and the reciprocal arrangements with the UK concerning the Common Travel Area (CTA), for the purpose of this factor periods of residence within the CTA immediately prior to moving to live in Ireland should be treated the same as periods of residence in Ireland. This arrangement applies only to UK citizens and EEA nationals who had their centre of interest within the Common Travel Area during those periods.&rdquo;</i></P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Deputy has referred in his question to paragraph 5.4 of these guidelines. This paragraph deals with the applicant&rsquo;s main centre of interest at the time of application, and emphasises that centre of interest &ldquo;<i>must be in the Republic of Ireland</i>&rdquo;. This paragraph has been amended in minor ways for clarification since the first issue of the guidelines in 2004, but the substance has not been changed. For instance, in a revision in July 2008, the words &ldquo;the Republic of&rdquo; were inserted in the above phrase because it was suggested that the previous wording &ldquo;must be in Ireland&rdquo; could be misinterpreted as referring to the island of Ireland instead of the political entity of Ireland. The habitual residence condition guidelines, and in particular the part dealing with the centre of interest, have always been consistent with the legislative provision that a person must be habitually resident in the State in order to qualify for the relevant assistance payments or child benefit.</P>

	<P>The estimated expenditure on printer consumables for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and its Agencies, other than the Combat Poverty Agency and the Family Support Agency, is set out in the table below. Replacement toner is supplied as part of the general maintenance contracts for the Department&rsquo;s photocopiers and the cost of toner is not identified separately. However, as the main bulk of these maintenance costs relates to the supply of replacement toner, the full photocopier maintenance costs are included in figures supplied in the following table.</P>
        <P>The Combat Poverty Agency was integrated with the Office for Social Inclusion in July 2009 to form the Social Inclusion Division within the Department of Social and Family Affairs. However, due to the temporary relocation of its former staff, the relevant information for the Combat Poverty Agency is not currently accessible. This information will be transmitted to the Deputy as soon as soon as possible. Information relating to the Family Support Agency is currently being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly. Future purchases of printer consumables will be guided by the advice received from the National Procurement Service.</P>

	<P>Disability Allowance is a weekly Allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66. The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.

She was refused Disability Allowance on 14 April 2010 and she was formally notified of this decision by letter and of her right of appeal within 21 days to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

	<P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the assessment of capital for the purposes of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  In assessing means for social assistance purposes, including jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property (except the home).  Capital may include the following:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Stocks and shares of every description, which are assessed according to their current market value.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Savings certificates / bonds / national instalment savings, which are assessed according to their current market value.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Money invested in a bank, building society etc.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">Any balances of redundancy lump sums owned by a claimant or his or her spouse or partner are assessed in the same way as capital from any other source. In assessing the yearly value of the property or capital, no account is taken of the income, if any, from the property.  For assessment purposes, the market value of the property is established together with the nominal amount of savings etc. and the yearly value for means testing purposes is assessed by reference to a formula.  This formula is not designed to reflect the actual or potential income yield from the property or capital.  A certain initial amount of property is not assessed with progressive increases in the assessment rate depending on the value of the property owned &mdash; this reflects the fact that persons with reasonable resources are in a position to use some of those resources to maintain themselves.  The arrangements in the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance are as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">Where a claimant has a spouse or a partner, the assessment is based on the combined means of the couple including any capital owned by either the spouse and partner or jointly.  The formula outlined above is then applied, so for example, a single person or a couple with capital of &euro;50,000 would receive &euro;70 per week less than a person or couple with capital of up to 20,000.  Assuming no other means, the total paid per week to a single person in these circumstances would be &euro;126.00 while the total paid to a couple with no children would be &euro;256.10, a reduction of &euro;70 in both examples.  There is no provision in the current arrangements for doubling the <Col N="752"/>amount to be disregarded in the case of a couple.  Any changes to the current capital assessment arrangements would fall to be considered in a Budgetary context and in the context of continuing to reduce overall public expenditure and restoring stability to the public finances.</P>

	<P>Disability Allowance is a weekly Allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66. The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.  The person concerned applied for Disability Allowance on 13 October 2008.  He was examined by a Medical Assessor who deemed he was not medically suitable for Disability Allowance.  His means were investigated by a Social Welfare Inspector and he failed to disclose details of his means.  His claim was refused by a Deciding Officer on 3 March 2009 on the grounds that he was not medically suitable and he had failed to show his means did not exceed the statutory limit for receipt of Disability Allowance.</P>
        <P>A letter issued to the person on 3 March 2009 advising him of this decision and of his right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals office within 21 days.  The person subsequently appealed this decision and an oral hearing was heard by an Appeals Officer on 7 December 2009. Based on the evidence before the Appeals Officer, he was satisfied that the person failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit applicable and that he was not substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment by reason of a specified disability within the meaning of Social Welfare legislation and he disallowed the appeal.  The person concerned was notified of this decision in writing on 21 January 2010 by the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  An Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision is final and conclusive in the absence of any fresh facts or evidence.</P>

	<P>I am unable to provide the information sought by the Deputy due to industrial action currently being taken.  Statistics for 2009 show that 530 Irish people who made applications for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance did not satisfy the habitual residence condition in that year.  It should be noted that this figure includes a number of people who, although they were not born in this State, are Irish passport holders by virtue of their ancestral ties with Ireland.  Some never previously lived or worked here and claimed Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance almost immediately on entry to this country even though it was not their intention to reside permanently in this State.  Accordingly, they do not meet the criteria for the habitual residence condition.  It is open to any customer who is not satisfied with the decision on their claim to appeal that decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

	<P>Illness Benefit is a short-term income support payment made to insured people who are unable to work due to illness or incapacity and who satisfy certain Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) conditions.  For rehabilitative and occupational therapy purposes, customers, who have been in receipt of Illness Benefit for at least six months, may be granted permission to work part-time (not more than 20 hours per week) or to participate in a Community Employment (C.E.) scheme or F&Aacute;S training course.  This permission is known as an exemption, the aim of which is to enable them, subsequently, to return to the workplace on a full-time basis.</P><Col N="755"/>
        <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of Illness Benefit since 19th April 2007.  In February 2008 an exemption was granted to engage in part-time work for an initial 6 month period which was later extended.  Applications for exemptions are considered by one of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors who considers the nature of the particular illness or incapacity, treatment received and prognosis.  They assess the nature of the proposed employment or training and consider whether or not the work or training is appropriate in light of the person&rsquo;s incapacity and how, in the context of rehabilitation/occupational therapy, it would progress a return to full-time work.</P>
        <P>Approval for an exemption is provided for a given period.  If the employment or training is to continue beyond the period of the initial approval the person&rsquo;s continuing suitability for an exemption is reviewed by a Medical Assessor.  When a point is reached at which it is considered that the rehabilitative and occupational therapy benefits of the work or training have been exhausted entitlement to an exemption ceases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The case was reviewed by a Medical Assessor in October 2009 following which a further extension was not approved.  The person concerned requested a review of this determination and on 26th November 2009 the Chief Medical Adviser upheld the determination of the Medical Assessor.  The person concerned was duly informed by letter on 9th December 2009, and advised to forward her P45 and related documentation to this Department to confirm that she had ceased work and would not commence any further employment or training without the Department&rsquo;s permission, in order to continue to receive payment of Illness Benefit.  A reminder to return these documents issued on 14th January 2010.  On 21st January, a letter from the person concerned, stating that she did not wish to relinquish her job, was received together with a note from her doctor.  As the person concerned no longer satisfies the conditions for receipt of Illness Benefit, payment was suspended from 2nd February 2010.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the Community Welfare Service (CWS) of the Health Service Executive (HSE). The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P>Under the relevant legislative provisions, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  Legislation does, however, provide for the making of a rent supplement payment to another person on behalf of the recipient, at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the HSE. Almost 19,800 (21%) rent supplement payments are made to a person other than the rent supplemented tenant, for example to a relative, a landlord or landlord&rsquo;s agent.</P>
        <P>It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the HSE any instance where a tenant is receiving rent supplement but is not paying their rent. Where a Community Welfare Officer becomes aware that a person receiving rent supplement is not using that supplement to meet housing costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated. Any overpayment of rent supplement incurred in circumstances of this kind may be recoverable from the tenant.</P>
        <P>Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process.  The CWS Training Units maintain a &lsquo;Best Practice Manual&rsquo; which contains specific guidance for Community Welfare Officers in relation to nominated payments. It is used as a store of knowledge on how to process claims for supplementary welfare allowance in a manner that is effective in meeting clients&rsquo; needs, efficient in administration and economic in the use of public funds.</P>

	<P>The Family Income Supplement is designed to provide support for people with families who are on low earnings. This preserves the incentive for them to remain in employment in circumstances where they might only be marginally better off than if they were claiming other social welfare payments. FIS is a central element of a programme of reforms targeted specifically at addressing child poverty.</P>
        <P>FIS is calculated on the basis of 60% of the difference between the income limit for the family size and the net income of the person(s) raising the child(ren). Net income for FIS purposes comprises total family income less tax, employee PRSI, health contribution, income levy, and superannuation contribution. The public service pension levy is also deductible from <Col N="757"/>income when calculating the eligibility to FIS.  There are currently some 25,956 people in receipt of a weekly FIS payment of which over 11% are public servants.</P>

	<P>Persons in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant may engage in employment, self employment, training or education outside the home for up to 15 hours per week and still be considered to be providing full-time care and attention for the purposes of the schemes.  This means that where a carer remains in employment he or she will continue to pay the appropriate social insurance contribution. Also, any person, including a carer, may pay voluntary contributions once they satisfy certain qualifying conditions.</P><Col N="759"/>
        <P>The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  However, the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate, and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.  People who qualify for payments such as carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit may, subject to conditions, qualify for credited contributions for the period they are receiving the payment.  As part of the National Pensions Framework, published in March this year, the current homemakers disregards will be replaced by credits for new pensioners from 2012, with backdating to 1994. This reform will be of particular benefit to carers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Treatment Benefit is a PRSI based scheme offering assistance towards the cost of Dental and Optical Treatment for qualified patients. It is a unique scheme, in that payment is made not to the customers themselves, but to contractors (dentists and opticians) on their behalf, who provide treatment either free or at a reduced rate. As such, we provide our customers with treatment rather than payment. Consequently, by the time we receive an actual claim, the customer has almost always already received his or her entitlement and it is the contractor who is waiting to be paid in the agreed monthly payment schedule.</P>
        <P>The Treatment Benefit scheme currently has around 5800 claims waiting to be processed. A further 2700 claims are also awaiting further manual intervention. The 5800 claims waiting to be processed represent less than a weeks intake of new claims, while the 2700 claims awaiting manual intervention are awaiting further information from the employer, customer, or other EU country to allow a decision to be made.</P>
        <P>The Treatment Benefit Scheme is meeting its processing targets, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Over 90% of qualified claims received in April, for instance, will be paid to our contractors in May. The remaining cases (less than 10%) will be processed as soon as this Office receives the additional information requested.</P>

	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  All applicants &mdash; regardless of nationality &mdash; for the following payments are required to be habitually resident in the State: Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance; State Pension (Non-Contributory); Blind Pension; Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s and Orphan&rsquo;s Non-Contributory Pensions; One-parent Family Payment; Carer&rsquo;s Allowance; Disability Allowance; Supplementary Welfare Allowance (including Rent Supplement); Domiciliary Care Allowance; Child Benefit.  The question of what is a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; has been decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has determined that five factors are relevant in determining whether a person is habitually resident, and these grounds are specified in Section 30 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 as follows:</P>
<P el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</P>
<P el="5">(b) <?oasys _ix ?>the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</P>
<P el="5">(c) <?oasys _ix ?>the nature and pattern of the person&rsquo;s employment;</P>
<P el="5">(d) <?oasys _ix ?>the person&rsquo;s main centre of interest, and</P>
<P el="5">(e) <?oasys _ix ?>the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Habitual Residence Condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system is protected, while at the same time ensuring that persons whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it.  Previously, due to the high volumes involved, there were delays in the HRC Central Unit in dealing with the habitual residence condition aspect of certain claims. At the end of August 2009, the Unit had over 12,700 cases awaiting a decision. A number of streamlining initiatives and training programmes were introduced to help tackle the backlog arising from which the number of cases awaiting a decision in the Central Unit currently stands at about 3,000 and is expected to drop further over the coming weeks.  Accordingly, there are no plans to undertake any other reviews of the HRC decision operational arrangements at this time.</P>

	<P>The income and support services provided by the Department impact on the lives of almost every person in the State.  Over the course of the last three years, the administration of services by the Department of Social and Family Affairs has changed significantly arising from changes in both the economic environment and decisions of Government.</P>
        <P>In summary, some 1.4 million people each week claim a social welfare payment and, when qualified adults and children are included, a total of almost 2.1 million people benefit from weekly payments.  Over 600,000 families receive child benefit payments in respect of over 1.2 million children each month.  The total expenditure by the Department in 2009 was &euro;20.5 billion.</P>
        <P>In 2007, the Department processed approximately 2 million new claims and applications across its various schemes and services; it made approximately 68 million payments, as well as responding to over 6 million telephone calls, enquiries and conducting investigations and reviews. In 2009, the respective figures had increased to almost 2.5 million new claims and applications; 83 million payments and almost 7 million telephone calls.</P>
        <P>The Department has an ongoing programme of business, organisation and ICT modernisation which has supported its operations over the years in question.  This Service Delivery Modernisation (SDM) Programme has facilitated the introduction of new organisational structures along with the introduction of new technology, the replacement of legacy computer systems, the move to electronic payments and the development of a range of e-services.</P><Col N="762"/>
        <P>Improved processes and procedures, particularly in the Local Office Network, have helped to increase productivity among existing staff. In addition, over 450 extra people were assigned to claim processing since May 2008 and centralised units were set up to relieve some of the pressure on the busiest offices.  In recent months the Department has introduced a range of process improvement initiatives to deal with the increased volume of claims including an appointments system for those wishing to make a claim and a more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseekers allowance when their jobseekers benefit expires.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to providing an efficient and effective service to its customers.  Following an extensive consultation process with customers, customer representatives, staff, and stakeholders the new Customer Charter and Customer Action Plan 2009-2011 was launched in May 2009.  The Customer Action plan sets out the Department&rsquo;s aims and actions for the next three years and is a key part of the Government&rsquo;s objective of attaining greater efficiency in delivering public services in an affordable way and using modern technology to best effect.  The new Customer Charter sets out the standards of service that people can expect in their dealings with the Department.  It is displayed in all of the Department&rsquo;s offices and on the website.  The Deputy will also be aware that during the three years in question, there were changes to the scope of the services provided by the Department arising from Decisions of Government.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the General Register Office, the central repository for records relating to births, death and marriages in the State, transferred to the Department from the Department of Health and Children with effect from 1 January 2008.  Legislation to transfer the administration of the Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Blind Welfare Allowance schemes was contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008.  New claims for Domiciliary Care Allowance have been accepted in this Department since April 2009 whilst the administration of pre-existing claims transferred successfully from the HSE to the Department in September 2009.  In addition, the Combat Poverty Agency was integrated into the Social Inclusion Division of the Department in July 2009 and responsibility for the Governance functions for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) was successfully transferred from the Department to the Citizens Information Board (CIB) in July 2009.</P>

	<P>Since the 1st April 2009 this Department has been accepting new claims for Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA). This follows the transfer of the scheme from the Health Service Executive on foot of a Government decision to reallocate certain functions between Departments and Agencies as part of the health service reform programme.</P>
        <P>In the period 1st April 2009 to 31st March 2010 a total of 4,575 DCA applications were received in the required format of which 4330 cases have been fully processed by the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors. 1,594 of these applications have been awarded, 2,736 have been deemed not to satisfy the medical criteria for the scheme, while 245 have yet to be finalised.  As the Department has only had responsibility for the scheme since April 1st 2009, statistics <Col N="763"/>on the outcome of applications prior to that date are not held.  Where claims are deemed to be ineligible on medical grounds, it is because it is considered that the requirement of care and attention and/or supervision is not substantially in excess of another child of the same age who does not have a disability.</P>
        <P>In the case of an application which is refused on medical grounds, the applicant may submit additional information and/or ask for the case to be reviewed, this review is carried out by a different Medical Assessor specially designated for this task. Where a person is not satisfied with the decision of a Deciding Officer they may appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

	<P>The respite care grant is an annual payment made to all persons providing full-time care, regardless of means or PRSI contributions, but subject to certain conditions. The grant is payable from the first Thursday in June of the year in question. The grant was extended to all carers in Budget 2005. Prior to this, only those in receipt of certain qualifying payments received the grant. Details of &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo; grant applications received, the number of payments issued and the number of applications refused, for the years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 (to end-March 2010), are detailed in tabular form below.  The total number of applications pending at end-December 2009 was 585 and at end March 2010 was 117. Data in relation to the number of applications pending for prior years is not available. </P>

	<P>The Government decision on decentralisation provides for the transfer of the Department&rsquo;s Dublin-based civil service staff, together with a number of military personnel, to Newbridge, Co. Kildare and for the decentralisation of the Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) to the Curragh.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s Dublin-based civil servants, together with about 55 of the military personnel will relocate to Newbridge. Almost 90% of Civil Service staff that wish to decentralise to Newbridge have been re-assigned to this Department.  The new building at Newbridge is progressing well and is expected to be ready for occupation in the summer.  In light of budgetary constraints at this time the Government has decided to defer proceeding with the new building for DFHQ at the Curragh. This location, along with a number of other deferred locations, will be considered as part of the overall review of the programme in 2011.  In relation to costs for the Newbridge project, site acquisition, building construction and fit-out costs are borne on the Vote of the Office of the Public Works (OPW). I understand that the total estimated cost of the Newbridge project is approximately &euro;30 million.</P>
        <P>The expenditure by this Department for the project to the end of 2009 was &euro;905,604.   In relation to costs in 2010, it is estimated that ICT costs will be approximately &euro;550,000. Additional costs in 2010, for items such as furniture removals, will be met from within the Department&rsquo;s administrative budget.</P>

	<P>The Government approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Swedish-led Nordic Battlegroups 2008 and 2011.  Regarding Nordic Battlegroup 2008, Irish Defence Forces participated in two joint training exercises. An exercise entitled &lsquo;Illuminated Summer&rsquo; took place during the period 02-13 July 2007 while an exercise entitled &lsquo;Nordic Resolution&rsquo; took place during the period 01-16 November 2007. The cost for involvement of Irish soldiers in military exercises within the Nordic Battlegroup 2008 was &euro;522,728.00.  The Nordic Battlegroup 2011 will be on standby for six months commencing on the 1st January 2011. To date Ireland has deployed four Officers to serve in staff posts at the Force Headquarters in Enkoping, Sweden and these officers took up their duties on the 28th August 2009.  The Nordic Battlegroup 2011 has not undertaken any military exercises to date. Consequently, no costs on military exercises have been incurred by the Department of Defence in respect of this Battlegroup.</P>

	<P>Ireland has offered, through the UN Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS), to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time. This figure equates to some 10% of Ireland&rsquo;s standing Army (excluding Reserves) and demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the cause of international peace. This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland is currently contributing 754 Defence Forces personnel to 11 different missions throughout the world. Full details of all personnel currently (as of 01 April 2010) serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement<b>.</b></P>
        <P>Because of the significant uncertainty  as to the extension of the UN mandate post 15 May  2010, the imminent onset of the rainy season and on advice from the military authorities, the Government had no choice but to decide on 30 March 2010 to withdraw the Irish contingent from the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT).  The Defence Forces have since commenced their withdrawal from MINURCAT, which is scheduled to be completed by early June 2010. Also, this month sees the draw-down of Irish personnel from NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo from the current 232 personnel to 40 (approximately) in line with  the budgetary expenditure reductions announced in December 2009.</P>
        <P>Following the withdrawal of the MINURCAT contingent, it is intended to take some time to allow the Defence Forces to undertake necessary and extensive maintenance of equipment and to allow personnel some time off before examining further options for Defence Forces overseas operations.</P>
        <P>With regard to future deployments, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered.</P>

	<P>Following the publication of the Independent Strategic Review of the Defence Forces Medical Service by PA Consulting, my predecessor asked that implementation of the recommendations proceed immediately.  As you are aware, the PA Report has recommended a programme of major change.  The high level recommendations include:</P><Col N="769"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A centralized command structure for the Medical Corps</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The creation of a Medical Services Management and Administrative function to provide strategic planning, resource allocation and overall responsibility for the management and delivery of the medical service.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The development of medical officer led care teams together with a re-focusing of medical staff on appropriate clinical tasks.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A reduction in the number of doctor interventions, medical assessments and better management of health services outsourcing.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The report reaffirms the need for a dedicated Medical Corps and addresses the challenges facing the Defence Forces in recruitment and retention of Medical Officers.</P>
        <P>The structure and systems recommended in the PA Report have been designed to meet the demands and needs of the modern Defence Forces at home and overseas and to provide Medical Officers with a fulfilling and rewarding career.</P>
        <P>To this end a governance structure for the delivery of change in this area has now been put in place.  It consists of a high level Steering Group composed of senior military and civilian personnel.  The role of the Steering Group is to provide planning guidance, clarify the approach to recommendations where required and ensure that the project is implemented effectively.</P>
        <P>A dedicated Programme Group with civilian and military representatives has also been established and is now co-ordinating a range of projects.  It is progressing a number of the PA recommendations including the structure of the Medical Corps, the alignment of Defence Forces and Medical Corps strategies and the development of medical information systems.  Work is in progress on the recommendations on training and education, clinical issues,the centralised command structure, financial arrangements and outsourcing and medical information systems. A number of Working Groups are currently in operation to progress these issues.</P>
        <P>There are currently 20 Medical Officers serving in the Defence Forces.<b> </b>The number of medical positions ultimately required to achieve implementation of the recommendations in the PA Consulting Report is dependent upon the completion of the work of the various Working Groups and at this point in time no decision has been made on the final numbers.</P>

In light of budgetary constraints at this time the Government has decided to defer proceeding with the new building for DFHQ at the Curragh.  This location, along with a number of other deferred locations, will be considered as part of the overall review of the programme in 2011. </P>
        <P>The relocation to Newbridge however, is proceeding as planned and all of the Department&rsquo;s Dublin-based civil servants, together with a number of military personnel will be decentralising this year.</P>
        <P>The staff are currently based in two buildings at Parkgate, Infirmary Road, Dublin 7 and Col&aacute;iste Caoimh&iacute;n, Glasnevin, Dublin 9. Both buildings are owned by the Office of Public Works and the staff will remain in them  until the move to Newbridge.</P>
        <P>The new building, which is located at Station Road, Newbridge, is progressing well and is expected to be ready for occupation this summer.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> the timescale envisaged for the completion of the value for money review of the reserve Defence Force in 2010; his plans <Col N="772"/>to initiate a value for money review of the functioning of the his Department and of the arrangements for and implementation of decentralisation within the Defence area; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ensuring value for money in the delivery of services is a key priority within the Department and the Defence Forces. In this context, the Defence Organisation is widely regarded as a model for public sector reform. The significant improvements that have been achieved over recent years have engendered a culture of continuous improvement within the Defence Organisation and I am confident that where change is required, it will be quickly identified and implemented. The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes acknowledged the ongoing reform in the Defence Organisation. That report recommended a further reduction in both the number of civil servants and Defence Force personnel over a period of two to three years. This reduction has already been achieved.</P>
        <P>The Department of Defence is also committed to undertaking reviews in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s programme of Value for Money and Policy Reviews.  A Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force, encompassed by this programme, has commenced. The Steering Committee has met on two occasions to date and the target date for completion of this review is end 2010.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decision on decentralisation provides for the transfer of the Department&rsquo;s Dublin-based civil service staff, together with a number of military personnel, to Newbridge, Co. Kildare and for the decentralisation of Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) to the Curragh. Approximately 200 of  the Department&rsquo;s Dublin-based civil servants, together with about 55 of the military personnel will relocate to Newbridge. The new building at Newbridge is progressing well and is expected to be ready for occupation in the summer.</P>
        <P>Site acquisition, building construction and fit-out costs for the Newbridge project, are borne on the Vote of the Office of the Public Works (OPW). I understand that the total estimated cost of the Newbridge project is approximately &euro;30 million.</P>
        <P>The expenditure by the Department for the project to the end of 2009 was &euro;905,604. In relation to costs in 2010, it is estimated that ICT costs will be approximately &euro;550,000. Additional costs in 2010, for items such as furniture removals, will be met from within my Department&rsquo;s administrative budget.</P>
        <P>In light of budgetary constraints at this time the Government has decided to defer proceeding with the new building for DFHQ at the Curragh. This location, along with a number of other deferred locations, will be considered as part of the overall review of the programme in 2011. The site selected for the building is state owned.</P>

	<P>There are already a range of mechanisms in place under the Planning and Development Act 2000 to secure a planning gain for local authorities and communities from decisions taken by planning authorities, including section 48/49 development levy contribution schemes and the provision of land, sites, houses (or payment in lieu) at below market value for social and affordable housing. The Strategic Infrastructure Act 2006 also provides that conditions regarding community facilities can be attached to consent for strategic infrastructure under the Act. In addition, the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 provides that a windfall tax rate of 80% applies to the portion of a profit or gain made on the disposal of land which is attributable to a rezoning, where both the rezoning and the disposal giving rise to the windfall occur after 30 October 2009. </P>
        <P>There are no proposals for legislative amendments to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill to address the issue raised in the question.</P>

	<P>A comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure has been approved for County Kildare in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2010 -2012 published yesterday.  The Programme, which includes details of contracts currently at construction, contracts to start in the 2010 to 2012 period and schemes to advance through planning, is available in the Oireachtas Library.  In the case of Kildare County Council, the programme provides for the commencement of contracts in the period 2010 to 2012 at a value of some &euro;160 million.  A key input to the development of the programme was the  assessment of needs prepared by all local authorities, including Kildare County Council,  in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.</P>

        <P>In February 2010 I approved funding to allow Kildare County Council to place the Wastewater Treatment Plant Design Build Operate contract for the Kildare Sewerage Scheme with its recommended contractor at a cost of &euro;17.59 million.  Further progress on this element of the scheme is a matter for the Council.  Kildare County Council has submitted contract documents to my Department for the sewerage collection network element of the scheme.

	<P>Recognising that people with disabilities have particular needs, my Department endeavours to ensure that the voting process is as accessible and inclusive as possible. Currently there are two options available to assist voters with a visual impairment to vote at their local polling station; they may avail of companion voting or they may seek the assistance of the presiding officer. Other measures in place to assist such voters include the display of a large print version of the ballot paper in polling stations and the inclusion of candidates&rsquo; photographs and party emblems on the ballot paper.</P>
        <P>My Department is committed, as set out in our Disability Sectoral Plan 2010-2012, to examine the legislative, logistical and financial implications of independent voting, including voting by blind and visually impaired persons. In this context, my Department has met with representatives of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland and is considering a range of options including the use of tactile ballot templates like those in use in other jurisdictions. As with any review of electoral practice, it is necessary to ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained between accessibility and the secrecy and integrity of the ballot, having regard to our electoral system.</P>

	<P>Under the Building Control Act 1990, responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations is a matter for the owner or builder of a building. Enforcement of the building regulations is the responsibility of the 37 local building control authorities. The authorities are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, where considered necessary. </P>
        <P>The agreed national inspection target is that each building control authority should inspect a minimum of at least 12% to 15% of buildings covered by valid Commencement Notices served on the authority. My Department understands from statistical returns from building control authorities for the period January-June 2009 (the latest period for which complete data is available) that almost all authorities were carrying out inspections and 35 out of 37 authorities had reached the national target inspection level. My Department liaises closely with the building control authorities to ensure that inspection targets are met.</P>
        <P>The Building Control Act 2007 contains provisions, <i>inter alia</i>, to strengthen the enforcement powers of local building control authorities, which are operative since 1 March 2008. Building control authorities were given the option to bring summary prosecutions for all building code offences in the District Court, rather than by way of prosecution on indictment by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the Circuit Court. Authorities also have wider powers to make application to the High Court or the Circuit Court to secure Orders where buildings do not comply with the requirements of the Building Regulations. The maximum penalties for breaches of the Regulations have been substantially increased under the Act, from &pound;800 (punts) to &euro;5,000 on summary conviction; from &pound;150 (punts) to &euro;500 in respect of each day on which the offence is committed after summary conviction; and from &pound;10,000 (punts) to &euro;50,000 on conviction on indictment.</P>
        <P>Moreover, building control authorities are able to recoup costs incurred in taking enforcement action and to obtain the benefit of fines resulting from summary prosecutions brought by them.</P>
        <P>Compliance with the building regulations is kept under constant review by my Department. I understand that the Building Regulations Advisory Body, which was established under the 1990 Building Control Act to advise me on matters relating to building regulations, has completed a report on enforcement of the regulations and that this report is to be submitted to me shortly.  I expect that the report will be an important input to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing consideration of the building regulations regime.</P>

        <Quest> if he will initiate a commission of investigation into all aspects of the planning and building of the North Fringe new urban district in Dublin North East in view of the fire safety concerns and housing construction deficiencies which have arisen for new households there since 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Specific responsibility for the planning and delivery of the North Fringe development rests with the local authorities involved, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.</P>
        <P>The North Fringe Framework Development Plan, which was prepared by Dublin City Council in 2000, sets out the objectives for the area, the site context and the urban design framework. The plan emphasises the need for a quality bus service and the provision of community facilities, including schools, a library, sports facilities and public spaces, which will serve the anticipated 30,000 people who will ultimately live in the area.</P>
        <P>Planning permissions in the North Fringe have been granted in line with the Framework Plan. While the overall roll-out and timing of these private developments is guided by the demand for housing and other market forces, it is clear that the provision of the community facilities mentioned, in tandem with the housing development, is seen as key in the develop<Col N="780"/>ment of the area. In this regard my Department understands that a North Fringe Cross-Authority/Agency Forum has been established to monitor progress in the North Fringe.  Membership includes senior officials from the two Councils, representatives of local residents&rsquo; groups and from statutory bodies such as the HSE, the Department of Education and Science, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and public transport providers.</P>
        <P>The national Building Regulations set out the legal requirements for the design and construction of new buildings, including houses, extensions and material alterations and certain changes of use of existing buildings. The related Technical Guidance Documents provide technical guidance on how to comply with the Regulations.</P>
        <P>Compliance with the Regulations is the responsibility of the owner or builder of a building. Enforcement of the Regulations is the responsibility of the 37 local building control authorities who are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, where considered necessary.</P>
        <P>The position regarding the use of pyrite in house construction has been set out in replies to previous Questions and most recently in the reply to the Adjournment Debate on 24 February 2010.  The position in regard to fire safety concerns at an apartment complex was set out in the reply to the Adjournment Debate on 8 December 2009.</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 313 of 4 February 2010, which gives numbers of unsold affordable homes by local authority area at the beginning of February this year.  The total figure of 1,158 reported at that time by the authorities excludes those homes which have been approved by the Department for deployment under the social leasing and RAS schemes. </P>
        <P>The situation changes very frequently as unsold affordable homes are deployed for other purposes, including temporary use under the social leasing or RAS schemes, as homes are sold and as new units come into the possession of local authorities.  Revised figures, which will take account of recent decisions by some local authorities to offer unsold affordable homes on the open market, will be published when available.</P>
        <P>My Department does not hold data in relation to the length of time that local authorities have had specific properties available for sale.  At any given time, whatever the prevailing market conditions, there will always be a certain level of stock of unsold affordable units on hands, including units in the course of being sold or being readied for sale.</P>

	<P>The cost of regulation and inspection of dog breeding establishments will not fall on the general population but will be borne by the dog breeding establishments through a registration fee.  This fee will vary in accordance with the number of breeding bitches, starting at &euro;400 for an establishment with 6 to 12 breeding bitches; &euro;800 for 13 to 25 bitches; &euro;1,600 for 26 to 100 breeding bitches and proportionate increases thereafter.  The fee will be payable directly to the local authority and the monies raised are intended to cover the costs of regulation and inspection. </P>

	<P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 363 of 9 March 2010, the making of a development plan has been a reserved function of the locally elected members of a planning authority since the introduction of planning legislation in 1963.  In making a development plan under current and previous legislation, it has been a matter for the elected members to decide the allocation of specific development plan objectives for the use of land for specific purposes, otherwise known as zoning, whether in urban or rural areas. </P>
        <P>Under previous and current planning legislation, it was and remains a matter for locally elected members of a planning authority to decide whether lands lie inside or outside the development boundaries of specific places or areas at the time of making the development plan concerned.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced a further provision under Section 10(8) to clarify that there is no presumption in law that any land zoned in a particular development plan (including a development plan that has been varied) should remain so zoned in any subsequent development plan.</P>

	<P>In the case of family-type accommodation provided by approved voluntary and co-operative housing bodies, under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme (CLSS), tenants are drawn from the local authority housing waiting list and rents are largely based on the local authority Differential Rents Schemes.  Under the CLSS the application of the rent formula as set out in the scheme may be modified, at the discretion of the approved housing body, in particular respects where they consider this appropriate.  Rent payable under the scheme by a tenant to an approved housing body is based on household income <Col N="785"/>in the previous tax year.  Where this would result in hardship arising from a fall in income due to loss of employment, disability etc, the rent may be adjusted accordingly. </P>
        <P>In the case of accommodation provided under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), which is aimed at persons with special housing needs such as older people, the homeless or persons with an intellectual or physical disability, rents are charged at a reasonable rate having regard to tenants&rsquo; income.  In cases where an approved housing body contributes a minimum of 5% of the capital cost of a CAS funded project, the approved body may retain nomination rights, outside of the local authority waiting list, for up to 25% of the units.  In these circumstances, the normal landlord/tenant arrangements apply, including in relation to rent, and tenants in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment may also qualify for a rent supplement from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>My Department understands that the approved housing body in this case will review the tenancy arrangements with the person concerned to ensure that the appropriate rent formula is applied.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the WEEE Directive, financing the environmentally sound management, including recycling, of waste electrical and electronic equipment is solely a producer responsibility.  Two collective compliance schemes, functioning under the responsibility of producers, are operating in Ireland. </P>
        <P>These compliance schemes, WEEE Ireland and the European Recycling Platform, are responsible for ensuring that all recovered household WEEE is managed in an environmentally sound manner and for putting in place tracking and auditing systems for materials recovery in line with the requirements of the Directive.  The compliance schemes are also responsible for <Col N="786"/>the procurement of the environmentally sound management, including recycling, of all household WEEE deposited at designated collection points.  These include civic amenity facilities and retail outlets.  The compliance schemes report that circa 9kg per capita of household WEEE is being collected for recycling per annum; this is over double the prescribed 4kg target as set out in the WEEE Directive and indicates that Ireland has had significant success in implementing this Directive.</P>
        <P>Retailers are required by law to take back WEEE free of charge on a one-for-one, like-for-like, basis from householders.  Where a replacement product is bought over the counter, retailers must take back the old product in-store, either at the time of sale or within a maximum of 15 days of the date of sale.  Where a replacement product is delivered, retailers must take back the old product, if ready for immediate collection, on completion of the delivery or within a maximum of 30 days of the date of delivery.  Each local authority must also accept household WEEE free of charge at its civic amenity facilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Retailers can have their premises designated as &lsquo;WEEE collection points&rsquo; or deposit household WEEE free of charge at local authority civic amenity facilities.  There are currently in excess of 600 &lsquo;WEEE collection points&rsquo; including both retail outlets and civic amenity facilities.  Retailers are obliged to notify purchasers of these take back arrangements.  Information on the WEEE take back system is available on my Department&rsquo;s website &mdash; <i>www.environ.ie.</i></P>
        <P>The WEEE Monitoring Group, which is made up of representatives from relevant industry and public sector stakeholders, oversees the implementation and operation of the WEEE Directive in Ireland.  My Department continues to work with relevant stakeholders through this Group to ensure that Ireland continues its strong track record of performance versus our EU targets for WEEE recovery and recycling.</P>

	<P>Lagarosiphon major, also known as the curly-leaved pondweed, is a native of southern Africa.  It has been widely sold for many years as an oxygenating plant for garden ponds and aquaria.  However, it is viewed as a major threat to Irish lakes and their associated wildlife since it became established in Lough Corrib in 2005. </P>
        <P>My Department has been working on this matter for some time with the Central Fisheries Board, the Western Regional Fisheries Board, the Office of Public Works and Galway County <Col N="787"/>Council, and provided funding to the Central Fisheries Board in 2007 to purchase a weed cutting boat which is dedicated exclusively to removing Lagarosiphon major in Lough Corrib.  I provided additional funding of &euro;200,000 in 2008 to the Central Fisheries Board for work involving the removal and control of Lagarosiphon major in the lake.</P>

        <P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 409 of 2 March 2010, the Authority received sanction from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in October 2006 to borrow up to the statutory limit of &euro;127 million for the purposes of property acquisition, primarily in connection with the impending acquisition of the Irish Glass Bottle site.  This sanction was granted with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  I understand that, as part of the IGB acquisition, the Authority provided to the funding banks a two-year bank guarantee to the value of &euro;26m in respect of certain possible defaults.  In March 2009, a new guarantee for &euro;29.1m was signed by the DDDA, the increase from the original &euro;26m reflecting additional monies borrowed in the interim to fund remediation works.

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s new Tentative List of potential nominees to the World Heritage List has been submitted to UNESCO.  The Monastic City of Clonmacnoise and its Cultural Landscape is included on the new List. Clonmacnoise is also included on the List in the Early Medieval Monastic Sites series. </P>
        <P>A Tentative List is an inventory of properties situated on its territory which a State Party to the World Heritage Convention, such as Ireland, considers suitable for inscription on the World Heritage List.  For each property on Ireland&rsquo;s new Tentative List, a standard form was submitted to UNESCO, in accordance with its guidelines. Each form contains the name of the property, geographical location, brief description and justification of its outstanding universal value.  The submission of the Tentative List to UNESCO is a different process to that of the nomination of a property to the World Heritage List.  Such a nomination takes  considerable time to prepare and each property nominated for inclusion on the World Heritage List is subject to evaluation by UNESCO over, normally, an 18 month period.</P>
        <P>In the case of Clonmacnoise, certain key issues, including the scale of the core and buffer zones of the proposed property, concerns about possible impacts on farming and planning practices, and concerns regarding the graveyard, need to be explored further with the local community before progress can be made as regards the proposed nomination to the World Heritage List.</P>
        <P>A meeting will shortly be held between the Clonmacnoise Action Group and my Department.</P>

	<P>In recognition of the difficulties for turf cutters affected by the necessary cessation of turf-cutting on these sites, cutting has been allowed to continue for more than ten years since these sites were designated, in order to allow the people concerned to make alternative fuel arrangements.  Given the scientific evidence of the damage to protected habitats in these Special Areas of Conservation due to turf-cutting and associated drainage, a further derogation permitting turf cutting to continue on these sites cannot be provided. </P>
        <P>I expect to receive the report of the Inter-departmental Working Group on Cessation of Cutting in Designated Raised Bogs very shortly. I will conclude my consideration of the report and any recommendations it contains as rapidly as possible, and will then be in touch with affected individuals and representative groups in regard to the position.</P>

	<P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 which I published yesterday,  provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Kildare.  While provision is made to commence contracts to the value of some &euro;160 million in the county during the period of the programme, it was not possible to include the Ballyna Regional Water Supply Scheme amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion. </P>
        <P>The new programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth as envisaged in the Government&rsquo;s policy document Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy &mdash; A Framework for Sustainable Economic Revival. <Col N="791"/> A key input to the development of the programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Kildare County Council, in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised by my Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time.</P>

	<P>Potential fines that may be imposed by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in respect of non-compliance with EU legislation are determined by a number of variable coefficients, the value of which is determined at the discretion of the ECJ.  Accordingly, it is not possible to predict specific penalties with certainty for any given breach of legislation, notably legislation in respect of which the compliance timeframe has not expired. </P>
        <P>My focus is on making sure that Ireland meets its obligations and avoids the imposition fines.  A range of policies and measures are already in place, and being developed, to deliver sustainable, resource based waste management policy and practice and to ensure that waste materials which can be reused and recycled are not drawn to largescale residential waste treatment facilities.  I am determined to take whatever further steps may be necessary to ensure compliance with the Landfill Directive&rsquo;s targets.</P>

	<P>The EPA&rsquo;s report &ldquo;Focus on Environmental Enforcement in Ireland &mdash; A report for the years 2006-2008&rdquo; summarises enforcement activities including waste related enforcement activities by both the Agency itself and the local authorities.  The full range of waste related enforcement activities is explained in Chapter 2 of the Report. Relevant extracts may be downloaded from the Agency&rsquo;s website, epa.ie or hard copies may be purchased by contacting the EPA Publications Office by telephone on 01-2680100 or email at publications@epa.ie</P>
        <P>While I have no immediate plans for legislation change in regard to enforcement, performance in this area remains under regular review.  In July 2008 I issued a policy direction under section 60 of the Waste Management Acts, which sets out the required elements of an enforcement policy and requires that policies be directed towards the achievement of outcomes defined in specific terms such as the cessation of illegal activity by the use of legal powers.</P>

	<P>The primary motivation in aligning the management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice and the introduction of the appropriate regulations to cease mixed stock fishing is the conservation of the wild salmon stocks.  It is important to afford every protection to the remaining salmon stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch in order to fulfil obligations under the Habitats Directive. </P><Col N="793"/>
        <P>It is not possible to relax the conservation measures other than where river stocks recover and it is established from the results of the scientific analysis conducted by the Marine Institute in conjunction with the Central Fisheries Board that significant numbers of fish destined for other rivers are not intercepted.  It should be possible, in those circumstances, to exploit the identified surplus in rivers, bays and estuaries by all appropriate methods, within the constraints permitted by the Habitats Directive.  It is not envisaged that drift netting in the open seas will be licensed in the future, due to the indiscriminate nature of such a fishery and its impact on rivers&rsquo; stocks not meeting their conservation limits.</P>

	<P>Currently, on an annualised basis, 60% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity is generated from gas.  Overall electricity generation accounts for approximately 65% of our gas demand.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is the independent body with statutory responsibility for monitoring and ensuring security of electricity and gas supply.  Recognising the interdependencies between gas and electricity, the Commission undertook a consultation process on secondary fuelling in 2008.  Resulting from this process, they published a Decision Paper outlining Secondary Fuel Obligations on Licensed Generation Capacity in Ireland on 12 January 2009.</P>
        <P>Under these obligations gas powered generating plant is required to hold secondary fuel stocks (distillate oil) on site or in close proximity to generating plant with dedicated pump and pipeline between plant and storage tank.  Fuel stocks must be in usable form and must be <Col N="797"/>sufficient to ensure that baseload plants run for 5 days at 90% capacity and mid merit plants run for 3 days at 90% capacity.  All gas powered generating plant is required to fuel switch within five hours of a gas emergency being declared by the National Gas Emergency Manager.  Monitoring and testing of this obligation is undertaken by EirGrid, the Transmission System Operator, on behalf of the Commission.  I am advised by the CER that all gas fired power stations have been verified as being in compliance with these requirements.</P>
        <P>Oil and coal fired generating plant is not required to hold stocks of secondary fuel but is required to hold stocks of primary fuel relative to their size and number of running days.  There is no requirement on peat or renewable generation to hold secondary fuel stocks.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Innovation Taskforce provides a roadmap for one of the five Action Areas in the Smart Economy Framework and complements the progress which has already been made on other aspects of the strategy.  Specifically, it endorses the Government&rsquo;s vision for Ireland as a Global Innovation Hub and suggests that we have the potential to achieve this goal.  The Report has made a wide range of recommendations, some involving new initiatives while others call for a reinforcement and better alignment of existing efforts and programmes.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Government will shortly announce the establishment of a High Level Implementation Committee to consider and oversee the implementation of the Taskforce&rsquo;s Report.  This Committee will reflect the recent changes in Departmental structures and responsibilities which will be supportive in progressing the Taskforce&rsquo;s recommendations.  This implementation process will also need to take account of resource and other constraints facing the Government.</P>
        <P>Government policy on high speed broadband is set out in &ldquo;Next Generation Broadband &mdash; Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland&rdquo;, which I published in June 2009.  The policy paper sets out the Government&rsquo;s position that investment in broadband infrastructure is normally a matter for the private sector, facilitated where appropriate and possible by Government.  This approach is consistent with the applicable EU rules regulating the telecommunications sector generally which prioritise commercial investment over direct market intervention in the form of State aid.  My Department is progressing a variety of initiatives set out in the policy paper to improve broadband access in the near term.  In particular, progress is well advanced on the National Broadband Scheme, which will ensure every part of Ireland is provided with a broadband service by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>Mindful of the importance of high speed broadband to innovation and entrepreneurship, I am also keen to facilitate the roll out of next generation networks.  The policy and regulatory environments are helpful in this regard and recent announcements by broadband service providers have been encouraging with 24mbps, 30mbps becoming available, in addition to 50mbps already available to residential and business customers of one particular service provider.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 808 and 815 together.</P>
        <P>The Home Energy Saving (HES) scheme and Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) are directed at two separate sets of homeowners, namely those who wish to undertake energy efficiency measures and can afford to do so themselves, and those low income households who cannot afford to undertake the measures.  For this reason promotion of the two schemes is very different.</P>
        <P>Under HES, householders can avail of grants of up to 40% of the cost of energy efficiency improvement measures.  Measures included are attic and wall insulation, very high-efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.  The latter measure ensures that homeowners receive informative, professional advice from specially trained BER assessors, registered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  The HES scheme has to date been promoted heavily through a number of national press and radio advertising campaigns.  These campaigns have been supported by ongoing media relations, which have resulted in high levels of interest in the scheme.  The scheme also benefits significantly from awareness created by the over 2,500 contractors registered to the scheme.  It is envisaged that further direct advertising of the scheme by the SEAI will be undertaken before the summer.</P>
        <P>Given the particular vulnerability of the homes eligible for the WHS, this scheme is promoted through very different channels, primarily referral networks within the community such as GPs, HSE, St Vincent de Paul Society and MABS.  This approach ensures that vulnerable eligible homes are directly identified and services provided at the earliest opportunity depending on installer availability.  SEAI has in conjunction with a number of key stakeholders in the WHS published the &lsquo;Well and Warm&rsquo; leaflet which highlights the services available.  This leaflet has been distributed widely nationwide and is supported by information on the SEAI website.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the WHS was delivered to 19,000 homes, whereas over 18,000 homes benefitted under HES.  Whilst over &euro;75 million has been allocated to the WHS and HES in 2010, my Department and SEAI are also developing the proposed retrofit programme, announced on Budget Day, which will further reduce energy costs and carbon emissions in homes and businesses while creating employment and developing a sustainable market for energy services in Ireland.  The Programme will be the subject of a public consultation next month but in broad terms it will bring together the HES and the WHS as well as support programmes for business and the public sector.</P>
        <P>This new Programme has the potential to be the most innovative, ambitious, energy-related initiative ever introduced in Ireland.  It will significantly reduce CO2 emissions and contribute to meeting the national efficiency targets including the target of 33% set for the public sector.  It will also create significant employment in the energy and construction sectors in support of economic renewal.  Various finance models, including a Pay As You Save Scheme (PAYS), will <Col N="799"/>be considered as part of the consultation process and it is the intention to introduce a programme that will offer the least possible upfront costs to customers.</P>
        <P>There is no evidence to suggest that discussions about PAYS or any other model, has had a negative effect on the level of uptake of domestic energy efficiency grants.  In the first six months of HES, since its launch in late March 2009 up until the publication of the Renewed Programme for Government, approximately 23,000 applications for grants were made.  In the subsequent six months, since the Programme signalled that a PAYS model would be considered, the number of applications has increased to almost 27,000 &mdash; a total of 50,000 in 12 months.  It is the case that pending the finalisation and introduction of the Retrofit Programme, the HES and the WHS remain fully open for business in 2010.</P>

	<P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).  This funding is being administered by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, with my Department undertaking the design and implementation of a scheme which would use this funding to address the issue of basic broadband availability to un-served rural premises outside of the areas covered by the National Broadband Scheme.</P><Col N="801"/>
        <P>A total of &euro;13.413m from the EAFRD is available to the rural broadband initiative.  This allocation, being 75% of the total, would mean a total available funding of &euro;17.884m for the initiative.  State Aid approval has been granted by the European Commission as part of the overall process of securing the necessary approvals and funding for the scheme.  With regard to a proposed date for launch, taking account of the time necessary to design the scheme and to put the appropriate arrangements in place, I hope to be in a position to launch the first part of the scheme (identifying and verifying the applicants) in September this year.  At that time I would also expect that an EU Procurement Process will be under way to identify a Service Provider for the Scheme.  On an indicative basis, I expect the Service Provider to be appointed and roll-out to start around mid-2011 and the scheme to be completed by the end of 2012.</P>
        <P>As the scheme is only at design phase, there is no application process at this stage. Information relating to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</P>

	<P>The Standing Scientific Committee, in their draft Report on the Status of Irish Salmon Stocks in 2009 and Precautionary Catch Advice for 2010, advised that stocks of salmon in the River Suir were below conservation limits.  It is calculated that in 2010 the river Suir (including Clodiagh and Lingaun waters) will reach only 96% of its conservation limit.  In order to permit a harvest of fish, the stock has to be shown to exceed the required number of spawners arriving into the river.  The excess over 100% is considered to be a harvestable surplus and this surplus determines the total allowable catch. Accordingly, based on the management advice, no mortality of fish is permissible in the river Suir.  This reflects the status of the stocks of the river this year.  This assessment is reviewed annually.  If the stocks improve as a result of the ongoing conservation effort, as had occurred in the River Nore in 2009 for example, it may be possible to permit a harvest of fish in the future.</P>

	<P>Licensing Option (No. 08/2) was granted to Providence Resources plc and Star Energy Oil and Gas Ltd over 959 square kilometres in the Kish Bank Basin for 3 years from 18 August 2008 to 17 August 2011.  A Licensing Option gives the holder the first right, exercisable at any time during the period of the Option, to a Petroleum Exploration Licence over all or part of the area covered by the Option.</P>
        <P>During the period of the Licensing Option, companies generally conduct preliminary research, assess seismic data etc., as by the end of the Option period companies must either apply for a Petroleum Exploration Licence or surrender the acreage.  Any Petroleum Exploration Licence awarded over the area would be subject to a commitment by the licensee to drill an exploration well in the first three years of the licence.   Should this proceed to a commercial discovery, it will be subject to the revised Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration, Development and Production 2007, which provides for a new profit resource rent tax in addition to the 25% corporate tax rate previously applying.  These terms ensure that the return to the State will increase to a maximum of 40% in the case of the most profitable fields. The general rate of corporation tax is 12.5%.</P>

        <Quest> if he will make a comprehensive statement on the planned delivery of broadband to an area (details supplied) in County Donegal; when broadband will be delivered to each part of this area; his view on the importance of broadband for business and social purposes in this geographical area; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Prior to the commencement of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to help determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those who, by virtue of already being substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, were to be excluded.  EU state aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion. The mapping exercise found two broadband suppliers active in the areas cited in the Deputy&rsquo;s question and consequently the localities were excluded from the Scheme.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications market has been fully open to competition since 1999 and Government intervention into this market can only happen in the event of clear market failure as in the example of the NBS. However, it is acknowledged that even with a fully competitive market and with the full roll-out of the NBS there will still be a small percentage of premises that will not be capable of receiving broadband services, primarily due to technical reasons.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission has announced the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) under which some funding has been set aside for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently considering the detailed design and implementation of a scheme which would address the issue of those remaining un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas, including any un-served premises in County Donegal.  It is hoped to commence the scheme later this year with the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  State Aid approval has been granted by the European Commission as part of the overall process of securing the necessary approvals and funding for the scheme.</P>

	<P>There is no specific provision made in the Vote of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in respect of the threat of foot and mouth disease or indeed the threat of any other diseases falling within the remit of the Department. While the Department operates comprehensive and active controls to prevent the introduction and spread of a range of diseases, funding for these are provided for across a range of programmed expenditure in the Vote.</P>
        <P>The last outbreak of FMD in Ireland occurred in the early part of 2001, when both the Department of Agriculture and many other Government Departments and agencies were actively involved in the measures required to eradicate FMD and to prevent further cases of the disease. These controls led to the introduction by the Irish Government of a range of measures that had consequences for economic activity.  Following the single outbreak, the Department commissioned a report from the economic consultants, Indecon, which was published in February, 2002.  According to the report overall exchequer costs for the outbreak were estimated at &euro;209.65 million.</P>

	<P>The person named applied for 18 animals under the 2008 Suckler Welfare Scheme. My Department has issued payments in respect of 15 animals. Of the remaining animals, one was ineligible for payment as the dam was under 22 month of age at the time of calving. There were outstanding queries in relation to the remaining 2 animals and the herd owner has previously been notified of these. One of these was registered outside the statutory limit of twenty-seven days and the dam of the remaining animal was removed for slaughter before her calf was weaned.</P>
        <P>With regard to 2009 payments the above applied for 16 animals under the Suckler Welfare Scheme.  It is a condition of this Scheme that for herds of more than 10 cows the calves must be weaned in at least two separate groups with each group being removed at a minimum interval of five days. The applicant did not comply with this condition and, therefore, is not eligible for payment under the provisions of the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme.</P>

I am precluded from making a determination in relation to two of the three sites applied for because of non-compliance by the applicant with the relevant statutory provisions, in particular section 4 of the Fisheries and Foreshore (Amendment) Act 1998.  The applicant has been fully informed in writing of the issues, including the requirement to take remedial action.  My Department is continuing to process the application for a licence in relation to the third site.  Every effort is being made by my Department to expedite the determination of the application for the third site having regard to the need to comply fully with all relevant national and EU legislation.</P>

	<P>Matters relating to the Dog Breeding Legislation come within the remit of my colleague, Mr. John Gormley, T.D., Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  With regard to the Animal Health and Welfare Bill, the position is that an Animal Health and Welfare Bill which will give effect to commitments in the Programme for Government and the Renewed Programme for Government on issues relating to animal health and welfare is being prepared in my Depart<Col N="807"/>ment. The new legislation will amend and consolidate legislation in the area of animal health, particularly to reflect the changed disease status of our animals. Existing legislation will also be updated to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals is properly protected and that the penalties for offenders are increased significantly. The Bill also provides for the consolidation of responsibility for the welfare of all animals (including non-farm animals) within my Department.  I intend to submit the proposed heads of this Bill to the Government at an early date.</P>

A reactor retest was carried out on 17 December 2009, where one reactor was disclosed and was slaughtered on 5 January 2010.  As outlined in the Important Information for Farmers booklet, which is issued to all herdowners at the time of restriction, the amount to be paid by the Department under the On Farm Market Valuation Scheme, which is the difference between the on-farm market value of the animal concerned and the price paid to the farmer by the slaughter plant, can only be calculated and paid by the District Veterinary Office following receipt of a factory docket from the herdowner.  In this case, the herdowner has not yet submitted the factory docket. The District Veterinary Office has now contacted the herdowner regarding his difficulty in supplying the factory docket and is assisting him with the procurement of this documentation with the view to processing the payment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 834 and 838 together.</P>
        <P>It is clear from meetings held in recent months between officials of my Department and representatives of Local Authority Veterinary Inspectors, Animal Welfare Organisations and the Horse Industry that there is an increase in the number of reported horse welfare problems including an increasing risk of abandonment of horses. Local Authorities have extensive powers under the Control of Horses Act 1996 which was enacted to address problems caused by wandering horses in urban and rural areas. The Act provides for a comprehensive range of measures and enables local authorities to, inter alia, designate control areas; require the licensing of horses within such areas; seize and detain stray and unlicensed horses; confiscate horses, which stray repeatedly; dispose of horses seized; and, maintain a register of horses licensed and seized.  The Act also contains provisions on the identification of horses and criminal liability for permitting or causing a horse to pose a danger to persons or property.</P>
        <P>I have been in touch with my colleague Mr. John Gormley TD, Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government in regard to the implementation of the Control of Horses Act <Col N="809"/>1996 to underline how the ongoing effective implementation of this Act by Local Authorities can assist with reducing potential horse welfare problems developing particularly with regard to those horses that are being abandoned.  My Department&rsquo;s statutory responsibility extends to the welfare and protection of farmed animals only i.e. animals normally bred or kept for the production of food or for use in or for the purpose of farming. This legislation is enforced under the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations 2008. The main statutes governing cruelty to all animals, including horses, in this country is the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965.   Responsibility for pursuing cases under this legislation rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who may on receipt of a complaint investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an offence under this Act.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding in the region of &euro;2m per annum to assist Local Authorities in their work in implementing the Control of Horses Act. Mindful too of the valuable work being done by welfare organisations throughout the country and as a contribution towards the cost of their activities in the forthcoming year, I provided funding of &euro;1.185 million to assist them in their work in 2010. I also urged those welfare organisations that have the capacity to deal with larger animals to consider placing greater resources in promoting horse welfare.</P>
        <P>My Department is also nearing finalisation of the heads of an Animal Health and Welfare Bill which gives effect to commitments in the Programme for Government on issues relating to animal health and welfare including the updating of existing legislation to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals is properly protected and that the penalties for offenders are increased significantly. The Bill also provides for the consolidation of responsibility for the welfare of all animals (including non-farm animals) within my Department.</P>

	<P>My Department continues to support the development of the horticulture sector in Ireland.  This support has been primarily provided through the grant aid scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  Funding provided under the scheme underpins capital investment on farms that will facilitate environmentally friendly practices, improve working conditions, improve the quality of produce or promote diversification of activities.  This investment contributes significantly to the growth and development of the horticulture sector across all areas including the protected crops, field vegetables, nursery crops, mushrooms, soft fruit, apples and beekeeping sectors. </P>
        <P>In addition, financial support continues to be available to those producers who participate in the Producer Organisation (PO) Scheme.  This EU Scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to become part of a larger supply base, to concentrate marketing and improve quality.  Bord Bia also continues to provide support to the horticulture sector in their efforts to develop new markets by way of assistance in the areas of product innovation and marketing skills.  Bord Bia is also involved in a number of campaigns to promote demand for horticultural produce including the Incredible Edibles.  The Incredible Edibles is an educational initiative for primary school children that is funded by industry, and Bord Bia and facilitated by the <Col N="810"/>Department.  This initiative aims to increase fresh fruit and vegetable consumption as part of a healthy diet.</P>

	<P>The Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) has made a proposal to my Department concerning a limited Sea Bass fishery in the Celtic Sea.  In order to give the fullest consideration to this proposal, advice has been sought and received from both the Marine Institute and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority. In coming to a determination on what is a very complex matter, I am very conscious of the need to maintain the current level of protection afforded to the inshore Sea Bass fishery.   This factor is also recognised by the FIF which gives an assurance in its proposal, that the inshore Sea Bass fishery around our coast will not be the target of commercial fishing. The FIF has specifically proposed that vessels would be permitted to land only Sea Bass caught south of  (51.30&rsquo;N) in area VII, which is an area approximately 50 KM off the SE coast of Ireland.  </P>
        <P>In addition to the advice received above, a decision on the matter will take account of the views of all stakeholders, including anglers.  Minister Killeen wrote to Minister Lenihan in the Department of Energy, Communications and Natural Resources, who has responsibility for inland fisheries, seeking his views on this proposal and  Minister Lenihan has provided those observations.  I am currently considering the proposal together with the advice, observations and submissions made to date, in order to determine whether sufficient information is available in order to reach a determination on the matter. I can confirm that Minister Connick has received a request for a meeting on the issue from the group listed and he will be prepared to meet the group if he considers that such a meeting will assist in his consideration of the issues involved.</P>

	<P>The Food Dude programme is operated by An Bord Bia on behalf of the Department. </P>
        <P>The Programme was developed by researchers at the Bangor Food Research Unit (BRFU) in the School of Psychology at the University of Wales as a way of promoting increased consumption of fruit and vegetables. The programme is based on taste exposure, modelling and rewards. Children at primary level are provided with portions of fruit and vegetables (baton carrot, sliced cucumber etc.) at regular intervals over a period of 16 days.  During this time, they have the opportunity to taste 4 different fruits and 4 different vegetables and to see videos featuring peer models (the Food Dudes) who frequently eat and enjoy fruit and vegetables. Celebrity video clips featuring children&rsquo;s television presenters, sports personalities and pop groups endorse the message. Children who successfully complete the programme receive customised food dude rewards.</P>
        <P>In the second phase, lunch boxes designed for fruit and vegetables are distributed to the children and parents are encouraged to provide them with fruit &amp; vegetables daily. Teachers maintain a wall chart in each class to motivate children to include fruit &amp; vegetables in their lunch box each day.  Rewards are gradually phased out as consumption patterns are established.  The supportive role of parents and teachers is very important. Both have rated the programme very highly in annual evaluation surveys.  The programme was also identified in the Report of the Obesity Task Force as an evidence-based measure to promote healthy eating.</P>
        <P>Schools are selected on a cluster basis for logistical reasons and participation is voluntary. All primary schools in the cluster are invited to participate. Schools participate on an all-school basis with all pupils in a school participating in the year in which the programme is run in the school. To date 1,485 schools and 213,541 pupils have participated. Over 380 schools will participate in 2010.  A full list of schools currently participating is available on the website <i>www.fooddudes.ie.  </i>  For 2010 the budget of &euro;2.5 million in 2010 includes EU funding of &euro;500,000.</P>

	<P>Mechanical grading was introduced over five years ago in Ireland and is now well established and accepted as an independent, objective and consistent system for classifying beef carcasses.  The mechanical grading system is objective because it makes use of certain measurements of the carcass by the machine to determine carcass grade, as opposed to the subjective visual assessment of the human grader.</P>
        <P>Since the introduction of mechanical grading, officials of my Department have carried out regular unannounced inspections of meat plants to monitor the accuracy and performance of the grading machines.  For example, in 2009 a total of 415 control visits were conducted with over 41,000 carcasses checked during these visits.  On each occasion, the performance of the machine is compared to the performance criteria laid down in the relevant EU Regulations.  I wish to assure the Deputy that the grading machines continue to operate very well since their introduction into the meat plants.</P>
        <P>The price paid for cattle is a matter for the beef producer and the meat plant.  As you are aware the new pricing grid makes use of sub-classes within each main class.  This provides a more precise assessment of conformation and fat grade than when using main classes only.  The new pricing system aims to reward those farmers who produce a better quality carcass.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s statutory responsibility extends to the welfare and protection of farmed animals only i.e. animals normally bred or kept for the production of food or for use in or for the purpose of farming.  This legislation is enforced under the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations 2008. </P>
        <P>My Department does not operate specific schemes of financial assistance for animal welfare nor for dog protection.  However since 1995 my Department has made <i>ex-gratia</i> payments to a number of organisations directly involved in the delivery of animal care and welfare services.  Many of these organisations are involved in providing direct care and welfare services to dogs.  The funding available to any individual organisation is dependent on resources available and the level of demand and is therefore intended only as a contribution to the overall costs of the organisation.  Until 2004, these ex-gratia payments were made from residual funds available in my Department&rsquo;s Vote at the end of the year.  From 2004, specific provisions for this purpose has been included in and published as part of my Department&rsquo;s estimates.  Since 2005 funding in excess of &euro;6m has been made to welfare organisations, of which &euro;1.185 million was paid at end 2009 to assist welfare bodies towards the cost of their activities in 2010.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 878 and 902 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE)  is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs  Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs  Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational  needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such  support.</P>
        <P>The NCSE is an independent agency with responsibility for determining the  appropriate staffing levels in relation to the support of pupils with special  educational needs in mainstream and special schools. The review of SNA  allocations being carried out by the NCSE, through its network of SENOs is with  a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts are  properly met. This is an exercise in identifying surplus posts which are in the  system and which do not meet the current criteria &mdash; posts that have been  retained when a pupil&rsquo;s <Col N="822"/>care needs have diminished or where the pupil has  left.  At the same time the NCSE is allocating additional posts where the  criteria are met. It is not a cost cutting exercise. The terms and criteria for  the SNA scheme have not changed.</P>
        <P>Following the review, the SENO advised the school in question that the number  of SNA posts was being reduced from 19 to 16.  The school has appealed this  decision.  There will be no change to the number of SNAs until after the appeal  has been processed by the NCSE. The school was also advised that teaching posts  were at risk due to the current profile of children enrolled not being in  accordance with the school&rsquo;s official designation. However, the school was not  advised that any teaching posts would be suppressed at this point.</P>
        <P>I wish to confirm for the Deputy that my Department is very supportive of the  SNA scheme. It has been a key factor in both ensuring the successful  integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream  education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and  special classes.  The SNA scheme will continue to be supported.</P>
        <P>My Department is concerned to ensure that there is a consistent application of  policy in relation to the allocation of special needs supports across the  country.  This is all that is happening at the moment.  I do not intend to  instruct the NCSE to cease its review or to interfere in its review process.</P>
        <P>I want to take this opportunity to state that the NCSE will continue to support  schools, parents, children and teachers and resources will continue to be  allocated to schools to meet children&rsquo;s needs in line with my Department&rsquo;s  policy. In cases where adjustments to the staffing allocation in a school are  necessary, the NCSE will liaise with the school authorities regarding the  adjustment process.</P>

	<P>Project Maths is designed to transform teaching and learning of Mathematics at second level, so that students will develop instrumental understanding (knowing how), relational understanding (knowing why), the ability to apply their knowledge and skills in familiar and unfamiliar contexts, and analytical and creative powers in Mathematics. A key objective is to improve attainment levels in Maths and to encourage more students to take the subject at higher level. </P>
        <P>Project Maths began in 24 schools in 2008 and a national programme of  professional development is under way for all Maths teachers. Changes are being implemented at junior and senior cycle simultaneously. The programme will cover all the strands of Mathematics on a phased basis. Professional development for teachers will continue to at least 2013. Some &euro;5m is being invested in this area in 2010.</P>
        <P>Draft syllabuses are available for Strands 1,2, 3 and 4 of the initiative, and  will shortly be available for the final strand. The syllabuses are published on  the NCCA website. Strands 1 and 2  will be finalised in the summer in the light of experience in the project schools, and <Col N="823"/>issued to all schools.  Teaching and Learning Plans for these strands and a student  handbook to  accompany a DVD are available on www.projectmaths.ie</P>
        <P>The implementation of Project Maths is not without its challenges and critics.  However the approach has the full support of the National Council for  Curriculum and Assessment which includes teacher union, subject experts, school management, industry and higher education interests in its decision making structures. It has also been welcomed by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, the National Competitiveness Council, and the Innovation Task Force, who have all advised that urgent reform in Mathematics is essential to support a competitive economy in the knowledge society.</P>
        <P>Apart from the introduction of Strand 1 Probabilty and Statistics, which is new  content for most schools, the changes in the syllabus mainly relate to  methodologies which are designed to promote better understanding. To take the  concerns on board which have been highlighted during the first year of work in  the 24 Project schools, it was agreed that some aspects of content in Strand 1  in senior cycle would be deferred until students have had the opportunity to  study the content  through junior cycle.  However, there is a need to implement  the new methodologies in teaching and learning as quickly as possible in order  to impact on the maths competence of students who are shortly due to enter  higher education and/or the labour market.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the website referred to by the deputy has no connection  with the organisation named.  My Department is in continuing dialogue with the  organisation concerned on the implementation of the initiative. National  programmes of professional development have been provided for all teachers on a day release basis this year. This is being supplemented by evening programmes in the network of Education Centres, by on-line resources and a DVD being sent shortly to all teachers on the Strand Probability and Statistics. Funds have also been made available this year to provide intensive programmes aimed at teachers who do not hold a major qualification in mathematics. The investment in professional development will continue on a rolling basis to at least 2013.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that every effort is being made to support teachers in the  implementation of this important initiative.</P>

	<P>Marking schemes for examinations run by the State Examinations Commission (SEC) are developed in accordance with the protocols and processes in place for that purpose in the SEC. In that regard, reference is made to A Manual for Drafters, Setters, and Assistant Setters available on the SEC&rsquo;s website, www.examinations.ie </P>
        <P>A marking scheme is developed for each examination annually and provides the  means by which candidates&rsquo; answers are assessed accurately and consistently in a given examination in a given year. Marks allocated to a particular question  in the marking scheme for any examination may vary from year to year. In  allocating marks to a particular question or part of question, <Col N="824"/>regard must be  had for the context in which the item is set in a given year, and the role  which the item plays in the overall examination in that subject in that year.</P>
        <P>Approaches taken to teaching and learning in Project Maths differ from  approaches taken to teaching and learning in the current syllabus. As a  consequence, the approaches taken to assessment in examinations also differ,  and the marks allocated to a particular item on a Project Maths examination  paper will not necessarily be the same as the marks allocated to a similar item  on an examination paper developed for the current syllabus.</P>

        <P>The Council is a self-funding body and the annual registration renewal fee is  payable by all registered teachers regardless of their employment status and  how regularly they teach.  I understand that the Council did review the level  of fees payable by part time teachers and decided to leave the standard renewal  fee of &euro;90 in place.  The fee is in line with that levied by other professional  regulatory bodies which also do not differentiate based on frequency of usage.   Tax relief can be claimed on the full &euro;90 fee by contacting the Revenue  Commissioners.</P>

	<P>The funding of the George Mitchell Scholarship Programme is a reflection of the Government&rsquo;s gratitude for the significant contribution made by Senator Mitchell to the promotion of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland. The Government provided an endowment of IR&pound;2million for the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund in 1999. </P>
        <P>The Mitchell scholars receive an allowance of about $12,700 towards living  expenses and a travel allowance of up to $2,300. Their fees and accommodation  costs are met by the colleges they attend.</P>
        <P>Since 2003 the only charge against the income from the Irish Government&rsquo;s  endowment has been in respect of audit and investment advisory fees. The costs  of the scholarships and administration including salaries have been borne by  the US/Ireland Alliance from funds it has raised from other sources. This  includes several million dollars from the US Government.</P>
        <P>The attached table sets out the expenditure charged against the income from the Irish Government&rsquo;s endowment for the period 1999-2009. This information is  taken from the audited accounts of the Fund which have been laid before both  Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The George Mitchell Scholarship Fund (Amendment) Act 2010 will enable the Irish Government to make further payments up to &euro;20 million over a period of years subject to matching funding being raised by the US/Ireland Alliance. This  additional funding will enable the Alliance to further strengthen its support  for the promotion of US-Ireland and North/South relations. The programme also  ties in well with the objectives of the Strategic Review Ireland -US relations  which was launched in early 2009. The young Americans who study here will be  advocates and agents for the strong US-Ireland relationship among the next  generation. The Mitchell programme will also be a key plank in our efforts to  develop education links with the United States and will increase the profile of  Irish institutions internationally. This will be very important in the context  of our plans to put in place a new framework for the promotion of Ireland as a  centre of international education. The Mitchell scholars are likely to later  occupy positions of influence in the United States whether in politics,  business or the professions. We hope that their period of study on this island  will create an enduring legacy of goodwill towards Ireland and be of  significant benefit to Ireland in the future.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) is my Department&rsquo;s action plan for educational inclusion, and provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The action plan has been rolled out over the period since 2006.  The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS, was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate. The ERC&rsquo;s overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage set out in the Education Act (1998), as: &ldquo;. . . the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools&rdquo;.</P><Col N="828"/>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>In the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with  centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations  Commission databases. Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in DEIS were as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Medical card data for Junior Certificate candidates (including Junior  Certificate School Programme candidates) 2002, 2003, 2004</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Junior Certificate retention rates by school for the 1995, 1996 and 1997  school entry cohorts</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Junior Certificate exam results aggregated to school level (expressed as  an OPS &ldquo;Overall Performance Scale&rdquo; &mdash; score). This was based on each student&rsquo;s  performance in the seven subjects in which s/he performed best aggregated to  school level for the 2002 and 2003 examination cohorts</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Leaving Certificate retention rates by school for the 1995, 1996 and 1997  school entry cohorts.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The school to which the Deputy refers was among a number of schools that was judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a  sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion  in DEIS.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their  inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of  an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification  processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying  for a review. The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools  who applied for the review in August 2006. There was no application for review  received from the school in question.</P>
<P>It is recognised that the majority of schools in Ireland may include among their pupils, children with disadvantaged backgrounds. In general most schools are equipped to support the individual needs of children with disadvantaged backgrounds without recourse to supplementary targeted resources. However, evidence has shown that when disadvantage levels are found in significant concentrations that schools will require additional supports to supplement their efforts to address the educational needs of all their pupils.</P>
        <P>The main focus of Social Inclusion measures is to retain resources in schools  participating in DEIS, as there is a need to focus targeted resources on the  schools serving the most disadvantaged communities. This approach is in line  with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor  General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which  recommended that my Department focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently preparing for the next identification process to  select schools for inclusion in DEIS. A Steering Group has been established and  commenced work in January 2009 to identify the variables which best predict  achievement in schools. A comprehensive consultation process to include  relevant education stakeholders will be put in place to ensure that the  identification process meets the needs and concerns of all stakeholders.</P>

	<P>Primary education has a pivotal role in the preservation and expansion of the  first official language. The promotion of the Irish language has been an  important aim of successive Irish Governments and its place in our education  system has been consistently protected. This is reflected in the fact that in  recent years a significant number of new gaelscoileanna have been recognised &mdash;  17 in total since 2005.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware the Commission on School Accommodation is currently  reviewing the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools. When my  predecessor announced the commencement of the review he stated that no new  primary schools would be established ahead of the completion of the review and  the putting in place of revised procedures except in places where new schools  are warranted because of increased demographics. The interim arrangements for  the recognition of new primary schools, while the review of procedures is  underway, provide that the Chairman of the Commission on School Accommodation  would advise the Minister in cases where more than one patron expresses an  interest in opening new schools in locations where new schools are required to  meet demographic trends.</P>
        <P>Forward Planning Section has carried out a study of the country to identify the  areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for  significant additional accommodation in future years. This study indicated that  for the school year 2009/10 there was no requirement for any new school  entities based on demographic changes. This is not to say that certain  locations were not experiencing an increase in the school going cohort.  Following this detailed analysis it appeared prudent to plan for the  establishment of new schools to commence operation in September 2010 to meet  increasing demand in certain identified areas. There was detailed consultation  during 2009 with all patrons in relation to the areas under consideration. In  relation to most of these areas the view of the Gaelscoileanna movement was  that there was not sufficient additional demand for all Irish provision to  warrant the establishment of a new gaelscoil.</P>
        <P>There was a specific application for the establishment of a new gaelscoil in  Ratoath, Co Meath. However, after detailed analysis of the increase in pupil  numbers for September this year and of the capacity in existing schools it was  not necessary to establish a new school to cater for the demographic increase.  My Department was satisfied that the existing schools can cater for the  projected increase in demographics in September 2010. This situation will be  reviewed for September 2011 in light of needs and consultation with the patron  bodies.</P>

	<P>The current difficult economic circumstances have necessitated tough choices to  control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  As  announced in Budget 2010, a reduction of 5% was applied to the rates of student  grants and scholarships. This reduction was implemented in respect of all  grant-holders including mature students from January 2010. Changes in the rates <Col N="831"/> of student grant are considered as part of the annual Budget process each year  and rates become effective on a financial, rather than an academic year basis. </P>
        <P>From September 2010, as announced in the Budget, all new applicants including  mature students who are in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance for all  schemes and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses, will be  ineligible for student maintenance grants. The cost of the student services  charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met, for eligible  students, by the Excheqeur on their behalf. They should apply to their  assessing authority to have their eligibility assessed.</P>
        <P>Students currently in receipt of the BTEA or VTOS allowances and the  maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the  duration of their current course, provided they continue to meet the terms and  conditions of the scheme. Students progressing to a new course, with effect  from 2010/11, will no longer be eligible for student maintenance grants but can  apply for assistance towards the cost of the student services charge and any  fees payable.</P>

	<P>The pension awarded to the person in question is payable under the Colleges of  Education Pension Scheme which is administered by the College in question.  Under that particular scheme there is provision for abatement of pension where  a person following retirement takes up certain public service employment. Under  the abatement rules pension is reduced where the aggregate of the new pay  together with the pension in payment exceeds the rate of pay on which the  pension is based.</P>
        <P>The College, in accordance with its Pension Scheme provisions, has applied  abatement to the pension with respect to certain periods of employment as a  primary teacher. It is offsetting the overpayment of pension already made  against arrears of pension which would otherwise be payable to the person.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that where abatement arises it is the pension that is  reduced rather than the salary from the subsequent employment.  The abatement  in this case is not determined on the basis of monies being owed to my  Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 896, 913 and 917 together.</P>
        <P>I indicated my own view of the desirability of sending a clear signal to our  second level students about the introduction of CAO bonus points for  achievement in Leaving Certificate mathematics at higher level. The Report of  the Task Force on Innovation recommends that bonus points be announced now for  implementation in 2012 so that students beginning their Leaving Certificate  programme this September can make informed decisions on subject and level  choice.</P>
        <P>Legally, the criteria for admission to higher education institutions are  matters for decision by the institutions themselves.  The Academic Councils of  these institutions determine the admission arrangements for students.  I   realise it is a complex matter and that a number of groups have discussed the  issue and failed to reach a consensus to date on the matter.</P>
        <P>A major programme of reform in Mathematics, under Project Maths, is under way  at present in 24 schools.The overall aim is to teach Mathematics in a way which  promotes real understanding, where students can appreciate the relevance of  what they are learning and its application to everyday life, and how  mathematics can be used to solve problems.  While Project Maths is designed to  promote more positive attitudes and higher attainment in Mathematics in the  longer term, I consider there is an urgent need for an immediate incentive  which will encourage more students to take higher level mathematics. I believe  that incentive can be given by the introduction of CAO bonus points.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education  (NCSE) has published its Report on the Review of special needs assistant (SNA)  Allocation to Schools April 2009-March 2010 on its website www.ncse.ie.  A  copy is set out  below for the Deputy&rsquo;s information. A small number of schools remain  to be reviewed and the NCSE has indicated that these will be reviewed in April.  A final breakdown of the outcome of the review will be made available at the  end of April.</P>
        <P>I wish to confirm for the Deputy that my Department is very supportive of the  SNA scheme. It has been a key factor in both ensuring the successful  integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream  education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and  special classes. The SNA scheme will continue to be supported.</P>
        <P>I want to take this opportunity to state that the NCSE will continue to support  schools, parents, children and teachers and resources will continue to be  allocated to schools to meet children&rsquo;s needs in line with my Department&rsquo;s  policy.</P><Col N="836"/>
       <P el="10"><b>Report on NCSE Review of SNA Allocation to Schools April 2009-March 2010</b></P>
        <P FLI="0">1. <i>Context</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">On 9 February 2009, the Secretary-General of the Department of Education &amp; Science (DES) wrote to the Chairperson of the NCSE, Mr Sydney Blain, in relation to the allocation of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools. In her letter, she stated that an initial review of a number of schools, as part of the Department&rsquo;s SNA Value for Money and Policy Analysis Review had indicated that there were instances where the work being carried out by the SNAs did not reflect the basis for the allocation of the post and where the level of SNA resources in some schools was greater than the proper application of the criteria would allow. In this context, the NCSE was requested to arrange for its Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) to further review the SNA allocation in all schools with a view to ensuring that the criteria set out in the relevant circulars are properly met. The key circular, which sets out the care needs, which can be supported in a school setting, is DES Circular 07/02.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Following a discussion at a meeting of the Council on 11 February 2009, the Council agreed to arrange for SENOs to conduct such reviews and requested that the Boards of Management of each school be informed of the review by the Department.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Accordingly DES Circular SP ED 0009/2009 issued to all schools in March 2009, informing them of the review.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The commencement of the review process at this time meant that the NCSE was effectively conducting a review of SNA resources currently engaged in schools in the 2008/09 academic year in conjunction with the resource allocation process for new enrolments in the 2009/10 academic year, during which over 12,000 applications for teaching and SNA supports would be received. In effect the review encompassed a review of current SNA resources together with the processing of those applications for additional SNA resources.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">2. <i>NCSE Process for the Review of Allocation of SNA Supports to Schools</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">In general, the process attached to the review built on the established processes attached to the allocation of SNA supports to schools. In mainstream primary and post-primary schools, the allocations process was well embedded and schools were familiar with the overall approach. However, given the scale of the review, it was agreed that there would be a greater capacity for parents to be involved in the review process with the SENO, either by phone or at meetings convened through the school.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the case of special schools which cater for children aged between 4 and up to 18 years of age, the allocations process was less developed, primarily because these schools were established to provide exclusively for children with special educational needs (SEN). As the total number of children enrolled in these schools rarely changed to any great degree, the question of the need to apply to the SENO for additional resources did not always arise.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10"><i>2.1 Mainstream Primary and Post-Primary Schools</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">Since January 2005, the responsibility for the allocation of SNAs to schools was transferred from the DES to the NCSE.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Each year the changes in the level of SNA support to schools is determined by</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The level of support required for children enrolling in the school or children currently enrolled who may now have identified significant care needs</P><Col N="837"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The level of support freed up as a result of children with sanctioned SNA support leaving the school</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The level of support freed up as a result of the diminishing care needs of some children with sanctioned SNA support still enrolled in the school.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In some cases access to SNA was adjusted from Full Time access to Part Time access or removed entirely because of the improvement in the development of independent living skills of the child. However this was viewed by some schools and parents as a <i>reduction </i>in the level of support provided to the child and not as a positive result in the recognition of diminishing care needs or the development of independent living skills.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In deciding the level of SNA support to be allocated to the school, the SENO would visit the school and examine the professional reports for each child with special educational needs, which have specified the care needs arising from the disability, together with the frequency and extent of the care needs as they arise in the school setting. This would enable the SENO to decide if the care needs described are eligible for SNA support under the provisions of DES Circular 07/02 and if the support required by the child can be met from within the existing school SNA resources or whether additional supports are required by the school. For example, a child whose care needs arise from behavioural issues, may be supported by an SNA who might also meet the care needs of a child who requires assistance with toileting.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The process would also permit the SENO to discuss with the Principal, teachers and SNA the manner in which the care needs of the child arise in the school and also the records the school has maintained e.g. incidence reports. Parents would also be in a position to contribute to this process, as appropriate.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Every school was requested to inform parents that the review was commencing and to invite them to contribute, should they wish, either by phone contact or by appointment during the review. In this regard, many parents participated in the review process.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Finally the SENO would observe the student in the classroom and schoolyard settings, as appropriate, in order to assist in the decision making process. In some schools, the view was taken that this stage of the process constituted the entirety of the SNA allocations process and statements such as &ldquo;the SENO only observed the child for 20 minutes and made their decision&rdquo; were articulated during the course of the review. In this context, it is important to note that this stage of the process is designed to underpin statements that are present in professional reports or statements made by school staff and does not in itself constitute the entire decision making process.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The outcome of the process enabled the SENO to determine to what extent a child with special educational needs, who also has identified care needs, may require access to SNA support on an individual basis or a shared basis, depending on the frequency and extent of the care needs. In this regard, it is important to note that the SNA is always working under the direction of the teacher in the class.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10"><i>2.2 Special Schools</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">The review of special schools required the NCSE to take into account a number of factors, which did not apply in the mainstream sector, primarily the fact that <i>all</i> children enrolled would have special educational needs. Special schools are allocated SNA resources on a class ratio basis (e.g. two classes of 8 children with a Mod GLD would be allocated one SNA between them). In many of these schools, the number of pupils enrolled might remain static as the number of new entrants would match the number of pupils leaving the school therefore the baseline allocation of SNA support would remain unaltered. Consequently special schools may <Col N="838"/>not have sought additional resources for new entrants through the NCSE unless particular circumstances applied in relation to an individual child.</P>
        <P FLI="0">However, given the policy of inclusion, which has applied in recent years, it was recognised by the NCSE that many of the children enrolled, would have significant care needs, as set out in professional reports and that an additional allocation of SNA support, over and above the baseline allocation, might be required to meet the care needs of individual or groups of children enrolled. Therefore in order to fully review the care needs of all children enrolled in special schools, the review of SNA supports was conducted by a team of 2-3 SENOs headed up by the SENO who is responsible for the allocation of resources to the school and was conducted over a number of weeks in stages, as set out below.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In August 2009, the NCSE wrote to all special schools informing them of the commencement of the review in the special schools sector and that the SENO for the school would be in contact with them shortly. The SENO then wrote to the school signalling the commencement of the review and that it would comprise of 3 discreet stages in special schools namely</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Information gathering: </i>class lists for the 09/10 academic year and a profile of the current deployment of SNA supports throughout the school</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Administration visit</i>: Documentation including the professional reports for each child enrolled, records relating to additional SNA posts sanctioned to the school, the timetable of SNA deployment and any relevant teacher/school reports for each student that verify care needs</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Student observation and discussion with staff</i>: each student was observed in a classroom or school yard setting, as appropriate and discussions took place with the Principal, teachers, SNAs, where appropriate other individuals who work with the student and parents/guardians. In this regard, the school was provided with a letter for issue to all parents informing them of the review and inviting them to make contact with the review team.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">3. <b>Outcome of Review</b></P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>Overall outcome</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">Of the 4,000 schools, which are recognised under section 10 of the Education Act, 1998, in the region of 900 schools do not currently have an allocation of SNA.</P>
        <P FLI="0">To date 2,913 out of approx 3,150 schools with an allocation of SNA, have been reviewed with the decisions having issued to the school. The remaining schools will be reviewed in April, after the Easter break but the outcome of the review of these schools will not materially impact on the overall outcome of the review. A final breakdown of the outcome of the review will be made available at the end of April.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It should be noted that the tables set out below refer to Whole Time Equivalent posts (WTE) and not individual SNAs.</P>

The application has been assessed in accordance with the  published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and  assigned a Band 2 rating. </P><Col N="841"/>
        <P>Information in respect of the current school building programme, along with all  assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred  to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department&rsquo;s website at  www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published  prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the  Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of  which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching  to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my  Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in  the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget  of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs  Organisers (SENO) for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants  to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE  operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.</P>
        <P>The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs  leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any  surplus identified. Furthermore, schools can make applications at any time with  the result that the individual situation of any school can change and  allocations are not static. The Deputy may wish to liaise directly with the  NCSE in the context of his enquiry.</P>
        <P>I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their  needs. The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and  teachers and resources will continue to be allocated to schools to meet  children&rsquo;s needs in line with my Department&rsquo;s policy.</P>

        <P>In general, however, it has been the policy of my Department to provide all new schools with access-for-all facilities and special toilets for disabled  teachers and students. In addition, new schools with two or more storeys are  provided with lifts to enable access for all.</P>
        <P>My Department advises school authorities and their design teams of accessibility requirements during the architectural planning of projects.</P>
        <P>My Department issued comments on the stage 2(b) submission from the Design Team on this project in late March. The Design Team are currently working on a  response to these comments. Once stage 2(b) is complete,  the project will  progress to the tender and construction stage. The application for a Disability  Access Cert will be progressed by the Design Team in tandem with the completion  of stage 2(b) and the normal progression of the project to tender and  construction.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 915 and 916 together.</P>
        <P>While the Forward Planning Section of the Department has detailed information on projected school going population, in order to inform decisions on what  accommodation will be required in future years, it is necessary to know what  capacity is available in the existing school accommodation stock.</P>
        <P>In this regard, work on the development of an online facility for the compilation of an inventory of school accommodation has been completed. The  detailed functional specification for the inventory and the online interface  and database to hold the information has also been completed.</P>
        <P>This online facility will enable schools to provide information about their accommodation, including its composition in terms of permanent and temporary  structures, electronically to the Department. The Department will also be  collecting information on the age of existing school accommodation including  both purchased and rented prefabs. The inventory will also include information  on size of school sites.</P><Col N="846"/>
        <P>Schools will be able to access the online facility through the Department&rsquo;s Esinet portal. Initially a small number of schools (circa 90 schools) were  given access to the facility for testing. This pilot phase has been completed  and is now being reviewed before roll-out to all schools.</P>
        <P>When all the information has been received from schools, the inventory will provide key data and statistics on the existing school building stock  throughout the country at both primary and post-primary levels. It will enable  the Department to calculate capacity in existing school accommodation more  accurately and therefore identify where additional accommodation is required.</P>
        <P>When the information has been compiled and analysed, it is intended to publish it and this is likely to happen before the end of the current school year.</P>

        <P>The information requested by the Deputy is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The census for the current school year (2009/2010) is being  finalised at present.</P>
        <P>In the 2008/2009 school year there were 444 ordinary primary schools with two teachers and 299 ordinary primary schools with three teachers. This data is not  available for special schools.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that a number of amendments to the Student Support  Bill in relation to legal and policy issues which have arisen since Second  Stage are being advanced by my Department in close consultation with the Office  of the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>In light of the commitment to put the grants on a statutory footing, I am anxious to provide a statutory basis for all student grants, pending transition  to new administrative arrangements. This transitional period will necessitate  retention of the existing administrative structures in the immediate term. In  bringing amendments to Committee Stage, I will therefore be endeavouring to  provide for existing administrative arrangements for this transitional phase,  while progressing to a single scheme of grants as provided for in the Bill at  the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Government&rsquo;s wider programme of public service reform, I am also re-assessing organisational options for the grants administration  function in the longer run, with a view to revisiting the current proposals  provided for in the Bill. Possible options for a more significant  centralisation of functions are being explored with a view to streamlining  operations and maximising administrative efficiency. This examination will be  informed by the business process re-engineering exercise being conducted under  the Transforming Public Services agenda.</P>
        <P>These developments have required consideration of a complex set of legal options in relation to further amendment of the Bill and my Department has been  working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to address the issues  in that regard. I would like to assure the Deputy that these proposed  amendments are now at an advanced stage of preparation and it will be my  intention to proceed with the Bill on this basis in the shortest possible  timeframe.</P>
        <P>Subject to the technical, drafting and legal considerations arising, my Department hopes to be in a position to have these amendments advanced  sufficiently in order to move to Committee Stage in the current session.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 922 and 936 together.</P>
        <P>When the moratorium was introduced the Government exempted Principal and Deputy Principal appointments in all primary and post-primary schools and these  continue to be replaced in the normal manner. The impact of the moratorium is  therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties allowances  payable to teachers on promotion.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that the impact of the moratorium on middle management posts has applied unevenly in schools depending on the level of retirements. My  Department is going to look at how some limited alleviation of the position  might be applied for the coming school year for schools that have been acutely  affected by the moratorium.</P>
        <P>In this regard my Department is in discussions with the Department of Finance regarding the detail of such alleviation measures and schools will be advised  of the outcome in due course.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for school authorities to re-organise and prioritise, as best as possible, the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the  context of implementing the moratorium.</P>

	<P>The issue of patronage and governance of our primary schools is of significant national importance.  Irish society will continue to change at pace over the years to come and our education system must therefore continue to adapt and change to reflect this.</P>
        <P>I have publicly indicated at the recent INTO conference that I recognise that there is a need to seek the input and views of a wide cross section of contemporary Ireland on the relevant issues.</P><Col N="849"/>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware consideration of many of the relevant issues is underway already.</P>
        <P>A review of procedures for establishment of new primary schools is being undertaken by the Commission on School Accommodation. Among the range of issues being considered is the issue of patronage including the criteria that must be met to become a patron and the circumstances where changes to patronage may be warranted.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Department of Education and Science has had discussions on the potential transfer of patronage of catholic primary schools with senior representatives of the Catholic Church.

	<P>There are no plans at present to include Mandarin Chinese as part on the curriculum in second level schools. Overall there are a range of foreign languages available on the curriculum in schools &mdash; French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Arabic. A post Primary Languages Initiative is in place since 2000 with the objective of diversifying language provision in schools, focusing particularly on Spanish, Italian, Japanese and Russian.</P>
        <P>Experience to date has been that while students appreciate the opportunity to learn new languages, and are making good progress, the overall take-up remains low, and it is extremely difficult to develop a capacity and cadre of teachers within the existing system who are capable of teaching the new languages. For example, Japanese continues to be provided through the provision of &ldquo;bought in&rdquo; additional services provided by Japanese language assistants. Although third level programmes offering degrees in Japanese are being provided, it has not resulted in qualified  teachers of Japanese gaining employment in schools, or in schools prioritising Japanese as a subject within their approved quota of teaching resources.</P>
        <P>The Government is prioritising an agenda of curriculum reform in science and maths and improving innovation capacity in second level schools. There are no funds available at present or in the immediate future to support the inclusion of additional languages in the curriculum.</P>
        <P>Some schools are providing Mandarin Chinese as part of an initiative taken by the Confucius Institute and universities.</P>
        <P>The feedback from this initiative is very positive. My Department will continue to work closely with the colleges and the Confucius Institutes to support and progress this initiative, to the extent that the funding from the Confucius Institutes will allow.  It is not possible outside of this initiative, to provide teaching resources for Chinese in second level schools at the present time.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 926 to 928, inclusive, 930 and 931 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the recent ASTI report based on responses from 334 teachers of Junior Certificate science. This shows that 14% of schools have dropped a Leaving Certificate science subject from the curriculum this year, and indicates a teacher view that a further 20% are likely to drop a science subject next year. Of the schools which have dropped a subject, 4% have <Col N="851"/>dropped Biology, 65% have dropped Physics, 33% have dropped Chemistry, 4% have dropped Agricultural Science, and 9% have dropped the combined subject of Physics and Chemistry.</P>
        <P>The data requested by the Deputy is set out below in tabular form. It should be noted that school changes in subject offer is a regular occurrence, and the data for schools discontinuing a science subject in 2007/8 before the increase in the pupil teacher ratio, is largely the same as the numbers discontinuing science in 2009/10. In addition, the table shows the level of overall change between the number of schools not offering a science subject in 2005/6 and the position pertaining in 2009/10.</P>

        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P FLI="0">Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.</P><Col N="852"/>
        <P>In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support through curricular concessions. This concession is available as a short term support for teaching in specific curricular areas affected by circumstances which have not yet been possible to resolve through the normal planning and management processes.</P>
        <P>The allocation processes also include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The Board of Management of a school can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established specifically to adjudicate on appeals on staffing allocations in post-primary schools. This Board operates independently of my Department.</P>
        <P>The renewed Programme for Government provides for 500 teaching posts to schools over the next three years over and above additional posts that will arise due to demographic increases. Following consultation with the education partners clear and transparent criteria have been agreed for the allocation of these posts. One hundred posts have been allocated to each sector, primary and post-primary in the current school year. Agreement has also been reached on the allocation of 100 posts to the post-primary sector for the coming school year, 2010/11. Additional supports will be targeted at co-educational schools in single post-primary catchment areas and at schools that join together with other local post primary schools to increase subject choice in a town.</P>
        <P>My Department is committed to enhancing the teaching and learning of science in senior cycle, and increasing the proportion of students choosing the Physical Sciences. A comprehensive range of measures to achieve this objective are funded through the Discover Science and Engineering programme at both primary and second level.  Revised curricula in science were implemented in 2003 in primary schools and in junior cycle for first examination in 2006.  The  National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed revised syllabuses for Leaving Certificate science, but is trialling assessment approaches in schools prior to submitting its advice to my Department.</P>

	<P>The Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation 2006 to 2013 recommended that the provision of laboratory assistance for schools for science, which had been costed in the 2002 Report of the Task Force on Physical Sciences at &euro;18.8m per annum, should be revisited.</P>
        <P>Provision of assistants in this area would undoubtedly lead to demands for similar assistance across other areas of the curriculum where there is a strong practical component, and resources for this are not available at present. The availability of laboratory technicians has not been a universal feature of support for science teaching in second-level schools and, in some countries that do provide this type of resource, it is confined to certain types of schools.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that the cost of providing laboratory assistance for science only would be of the order of &euro;25m per annum while to provide such assistance for all subjects with a practical component, including ICT would cost c. &euro;122m.  Funding of this nature is not available at present.</P>

The master plan for this site is for two 16 classroom schools. In addition an enhanced community facility will be provided as part of the Phase II development and will be co-financed by Fingal County Council.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department met with the school authorities in September 2009 and explained the brief, construction method and the phased delivery in detail.  It is not possible to deliver the Enhanced Community Facility as a stand alone project. However it will be delivered as part of the phase II delivery for the second school on this site.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Phase I development the brief includes a new 16 classroom school, a Special Needs Unit and ancillary accommodation. My Department is also providing support teaching spaces, a junior play area of 200m<sup>2</sup>, a play area for the Special Needs Unit, and 2 ball-courts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The State Examinations Commission (SEC) assumed responsibility for the operation of the State Certificate Examinations from the Department of Education and Science from 2003 onwards.  The Commission is responsible for the operation of all aspects of the Established Leaving Certificate, Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Leaving Certificate Applied and Junior Certificate Examinations including written, oral, aural and practical work.</P>
        <P>Competitive tendering in line with national and EU procurement guidelines, directives and regulations is the standard procedure in the procurement processes of the SEC.  In 2003 it was brought to the attention of the SEC that the methodology in place for the application and payment of VAT on certain purchases from companies outside the state was not in accordance with the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; VAT rules.  This issue was reviewed swiftly and remedial action was taken to regularise the position for prior years and to ensure that the tax treatment of all future payments would be subject to the applicable regulations for intra-community acquisitions and fourth schedule services.</P>
        <P>Following the review in 2003 and the subsequent recalculation of VAT on payments to companies outside the state, payments of VAT were made to the Revenue Commissioners for prior years outside of the normal schedule for payment.  It was not the intention of the SEC, or prior to its establishment the Department of Education, to incorrectly apply the VAT rules to these or indeed to any other payments.  At all times the SEC, and the Department, acted in good faith in the discharge of their tax liabilities.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that whether VAT is charged at source by businesses in the State or applied on a self-accounting basis by the recipient of the good or services, the ultimate payer of the VAT is the recipient of the goods or services.</P>
        <P>It must be also noted that as part of the evaluation of tenders for the question paper printing contracts for the years in question the VAT liability was correctly taken into account in respect of all companies at the tender evaluation stage.  While the calculation and payment of the VAT was not made within the prescribed time period, this related to liabilities at the payment stage after the service had been provided.  I would like to confirm that no tendering company was disadvantaged in any way in the tendering and procurement processes undertaken by my Department, or the SEC, as a consequence of the VAT issue.</P>
        <P>Since this issue was raised and dealt with in 2003 the State Examinations Commission has continued to meet its VAT obligations as required by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

	<P>My Department approves the annual intake of students to the initial teacher education programmes in the Colleges of Education.  The numbers approved for the intake to the Bachelor of Education course commencing in 2009 was 1000.  In addition, 200 places were approved on the 18 month post-graduate course commencing in February 2010.  Depending on the College of Education there are various mechanisms for funding the programmes, for example via core budget, tuition fees and capitation grants.</P>
        <P>The latest data available from the Colleges indicates that c. 3,200 students are currently enrolled over the 3 years of the B.Ed and 217 in the 2010 cohort of post-graduate students.  Some fluctuation against approved numbers is unavoidable due to factors such as appeals to Leaving Certificate results, candidates presenting with equal points, attrition, students repeating a year  or returning after taking a year out and so on.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the current difficult economic circumstances have necessitated tough choices to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In these circumstances, from September 2010, as announced in the Budget, all new applicants who are in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses, will be ineligible for student maintenance grants. The cost of the student services charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met for eligible students by the Exchequer on their behalf.</P>
        <P>Students currently in receipt of the BTEA or VTOS allowances and the maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course provided they continue to meet the terms and conditions of the relevant grant schemes. Students progressing to a new course with effect from 2010/11 will no longer be eligible for student maintenance  grants but can apply for assistance towards the cost of the student services charge and any fees payable.</P>
        <P>It was decided to discontinue the practice of allowing students to hold both the BTEA or VTOS allowance and a student maintenance grant simultaneously as this represents a duplication of income support payments.</P>
        <P>Access/foundation courses are not approved courses under the terms and conditions of the maintenance grant schemes and students on an access course in the 2009/10 academic year would not be in receipt of a student maintenance grant. In addition, progression from an access course to a degree course is not a continuation of the same course and therefore students progressing from an access course to an approved course would not be eligible to hold the BTEA and a student maintenance grant for the 2010/11 academic year onwards.</P>

	<P>My Department has sought clarification from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in relation to the issue in question and has been informed that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is the independent body responsible for the regulation of Bord G&aacute;is BG) Energy&rsquo;s tariffs and pricing structures from small domestic customers to large industrial sites.</P>
        <P>Under the BG Energy regulated tariff structure, the level of each customer&rsquo;s consumption of gas determines which sector they are in with regard to BG Energy&rsquo;s tariffs.  This applies regardless of whether the consuming premises is a home, a school, a shop or an industrial premises. In addition, other unregulated suppliers are present in the market.  It is open to any gas user, including schools, to seek the best possible price given its particular circumstances.</P><Col N="864"/>
        <P>Regarding site charges applicable to larger consumers, a charge for the pipe which supplies each premises is levied on a monthly basis and applies throughout the year. Unregulated suppliers may choose to pass this charge on to customers each month or could conceivably offer a &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; on this charge for the summer should they wish.  However, the annual charge would remain the same and any such &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; would result in higher winter bills.</P>

	<P>The process of assessing eligibility for third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.

This information is not available in the format requested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Both VECs and local authorities are experiencing pressures due to the increased workload associated with the increased demand for student grants, particularly in the context of the recruitment moratorium in the public sector which, in some instances, will have impacted on the processing of grants.

        <P>Work is currently being advanced on the development of a scaleable on-line applications facility in conjunction with a number of VECs and local authorities.  Other measures include the introduction of a new, more simplified application form for 2010, earlier approval of the grant schemes, examination of the possible extension of the pilot electronic funds transfer (EFT) payments system introduced in 2009/2010 and the development of common annual renewal and re-assessment processes.</P>

        <P>Apart from the pressures associated with the volume of applications, a very significant number of grant applications are delayed because the forms have not been fully completed or have not been submitted together with the necessary supporting documentation. All such documentation must be submitted as early as possible to enable the awarding bodies to make prompt decisions on entitlement.  It is envisaged that the new, more simplified application form being introduced this year will assist in this regard also.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Government&rsquo;s wider programme of public service reform, I am also re-assessing organisational options for the grants administration function in the longer run, with a view to revisiting the current proposals provided for in the Student Support Bill. Possible options for a more significant centralisation of functions are being explored with a view to streamlining operations and maximising administrative efficiency.

	<P>The project to which the Deputy refers is currently at an early stage of architectural planning.</P>
        <P>The project was approved to progress to stage 2(a) in May 2009. A stage 2(a) submission was received from the school&rsquo;s Design Team in March 2010 and is currently being reviewed by my Department.</P>
        <P>In light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.</P>
        <P>The school has made an application to my Department for temporary accommodation to assist in accommodating increasing enrolments and this application is currently being assessed.  The outcome of this assessment process will be communicated to the school authority in due course.</P>
