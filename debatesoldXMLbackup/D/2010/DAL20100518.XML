      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 to 33, inclusive, together.  </P>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome this opportunity to answer these question and to speak on some issues which are often raised at the Order of Business with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
        <P>The Government established a working group on D&aacute;il reform in 2009, comprising the Minister for Transport, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Senator Boyle and my predecessor as Government Chief Whip, Deputy Carey.  Following a number of meetings, this group submitted a set of proposals to the Cabinet for discussion and agreement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Upon my appointment as Chief Whip, I examined the relevant documentation on this issue and I look forward to holding bilateral meetings with the various party representatives in the coming weeks, with a view to seeing where realistic progress can be made.  Reform of the D&aacute;il procedures has long been a matter of contention and debate in the House.  The last significant reform was made during the tenure of the late Seamus Brennan, when he was in my current position.  In reviewing the documentation, I was struck by how debate on the reform of the D&aacute;il procedures is often confused with the wider discussion on electoral reform.  The Govern<Col N="208"/>ment has a range of policy initiatives on this issue, and they are being guided by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>There are some simple and necessary reforms to D&aacute;il procedures upon which most members of the House would agree.  The principal issue among these is the need to reform the manner in which the Order of Business is conducted on a daily basis. The Order of Business lasted for almost an hour and 20 minutes last Thursday.  This is a waste of valuable time which could be set aside for the discussion of legislation before the House.  The Government has brought forward what I believe are sensible proposals for the reform of how we conduct the Order of Business.  These proposals are balanced and give the opportunity for the Opposition to make their reservations and concerns known about the ordering of the given day&rsquo;s business, without it descending into what was described as a &ldquo;farce&rdquo; last week.</P>
        <P>The achievement of consensus by all parties on the wider set of Government proposals will require significant political goodwill. The Government&rsquo;s proposals were an honest effort to make the working of this House more relevant and more efficient.  The proposals set out a new D&aacute;il schedule which would better reflect the normal working day, while they also accommodate some of the key concerns set out by the Opposition parties in the various policy documents they have released on this issue.</P>
        <P>I look forward to all my counterparts displaying that political good-will over the coming weeks as I hold bilateral meetings with them to identify where agreement is possible on reforming the procedures of this House.  The outcome of these meetings will define the timescale for progress.</P>
        <P>We can have all the rules and regulations we like, but it is about how we implement them.  I am fairly new to this position and I would like to express my gratitude to the Opposition Whips who meet with me every week to try to schedule the business.  There is real co-operation at those meetings to accommodate the Government&rsquo;s legislative proposals, as well as the debates called by Members of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is giving us a bad name.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  There is a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> here.  The former Minister, Seamus Brennan did some work in this area, as did Deputies Hanafin, Carey and Dempsey when they acted as Chief Whip.  However, we have seen no significant D&aacute;il reform.  I am here over 13 years but there has been no significant D&aacute;il reform.</P>
        <P>In the past, attempts were made to put together a package of reforms.  Would it be a better approach to do this incrementally?  A number of small procedural changes could be made that would make a huge difference to the running of the House.  I will give an example.  For the last year, I have had a motion on the Order Paper and I have it on today&rsquo;s Order Paper as Motion No. 77.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, Standing Order 21 of the Standing Orders of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann relative to Public Business paragraph (4) sixth line, after &ldquo;reply&rdquo; is hereby amended by the insertion of the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;and the Member concerned may then ask one brief supplementary question and the Member of the Government or Minister of State shall be called upon to reply in conclusion&rdquo;.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Does the Minister of State not agree that the Adjournment is a farce at the moment?</P><Col N="209"/>
        <P>A Minister of State, who has no connection with the Department involved in the question, comes into the House and reads out a pre-written script in response.  Most of the time that Minister of State has neither the knowledge nor authority to respond to the questions raised by any Member on any side on the Adjournment.  Surely that is an affront to the House, to Members and to the people who send us here.  Would the Minister of State now allow this simple motion to be moved today or this week?  It would take approximately three minutes of Government time to agree to this motion to allow supplementary questions on the Adjournment Debate.  It is a very simple thing that could be done today.  Many other procedures could be amended incrementally.</P>
        <P>Is the Government really serious about procedural reforms in the House?  I have not seen any major Government proposals in the recent past.  For example, when did the task force he mentioned last meet?  Are minutes of that meeting available to read in order to understand the Government&rsquo;s thinking in this area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked whether some of the proposals dealt with by the sub-committee on D&aacute;il reform could be introduced on an incremental basis.  I have not had the opportunity to sit on that committee.  I understand that sub-committee had eight meetings and I have read the minutes and the progress on it.  However, reading those is not the same as attending and listening to the debate and discussion that lead to these developments.  As I said in my opening comments, I have already had a number of informal meetings with a number of Deputies on the issue of D&aacute;il reform.  However, I intend to meet the parties to this sub-committee on a bilateral basis in the coming weeks to ascertain the priorities and to ascertain if we were to implement changes on an incremental basis what would be the areas of agreement and consensus.</P>
        <P>Having read the minutes as opposed to having participated in the meetings, trying to introduce the grand package of events seemed to be problematic.  While people broadly agreed, there was always some other requirement of one person or another.  Trying to achieve that larger package through unanimous consensus seemed to be problematic.  My purpose in having these bilateral meetings is to give me an opportunity, having a missed the original meetings.</P>
        <P>I have often contributed to the Adjournment Debate.  It is always much easier for a Minister or Minister of State to respond on an area relating to his or her own Department.  It is interesting to note something I never had a problem doing.  While I do not know whether Seanad Standing Orders allow it, frequently those contributing ask supplementary questions in the Seanad meaning that the preparation of the Minister or Minister of State responding is somewhat different.  The Deputy asked whether I would take that motion today.  I will not because I will not cherry pick.  In the next few weeks &mdash; I am not talking about a long period of time &mdash; it is my intention to meet the Whips and those who contributed to that sub-committee on a bilateral basis to understand the areas of consensus.  I broadly have no issues with what the Deputy proposes on the Adjournment Debate.  However, I am not prepared to take it in isolation until I see where the other items might go.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>When would the Minister of State like to see reforms in procedures in the House occurring here?  Could he state, for example, that we should agree on some proposals before we rise for the summer?  These are simple procedural changes that have been discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> for the past 13 years that I have been in the House.  Deputy Stagg who was a Member before I became a Member would probably confirm that the discussions took place before then.  Could the Minister of State not agree to take some of those proposals on an incremental basis and implement them before the summer recess?  Is the Government sub-committee of which he speaks still in operation?  When did it last meet?  Does the Minister of <Col N="210"/>State realise that he is <i>de facto</i> the chairperson of the committee on D&aacute;il reform?  Does he intend to call a meeting of that sub-committee in the very near future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The sub-committee on D&aacute;il reform last met on 27 January.  I believe it has had eight meetings in total.  I acknowledge I am chairperson.  I may well call a meeting of it.  Before doing so I intend to have the bilateral meetings over the coming weeks.  The Deputy asked if we could do things on an incremental basis.  If there was consensus on a number of issue I would not see any reason some could not be at least piloted in the run-up to the summer recess to see how they are affected.  That would mean having a large degree of consensus and it is in that context that I intend to have bilateral meetings, primarily because, as I said, I have read the minutes of the meeting and have spoken to my predecessor but I want to sit down and have the opportunity, on a one to one basis, to speak to the other people on the committee to see where consensus might be achieved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the Government has put something together at last.  The last time there was a paper from the Government on D&aacute;il reform was when the late S&eacute;amus Brennan was the Chief Whip.  I have no interest or intention of meeting the Whip on a bilateral basis to discuss a document that will have to be decided by this House.  I would welcome seeing the document before a meeting of the statutory sub-committee of this House, set up and chaired by the Government Whip to deal with these matters.  It is not a matter for bilateral talks but for that statutory committee.  However, I would welcome having sight of Government proposals on D&aacute;il reform at long last before a meeting of that committee because that is the way it should go.  I will not be stampeded, however, into Government proposals on a bilateral basis.  That is not the way the system works or should work.  The reason it has not worked up to now is because there is a difference between Government&rsquo;s needs and interests and those of the Opposition.  I am sure the Minister is aware that is the case.  Either we deal by consensus or the Government will do it by diktat.  Perhaps it will require diktat to get reform because of the contrary interests of both sides of the House, no matter who is in Government.  </P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider looking at this from an Opposition point of view now, seeing that there is every prospect that he will be in Opposition shortly.  He and his party might gain from looking at it from an Opposition point of view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a safe seat alright.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The other point on which I wished to query the Minister of State is the idea of a package, or doing it on a piecemeal basis.  It is very hard to predict on a piecemeal basis what the effect of one piece of reform will have on other unrelated matters until they are all put together.  It is extremely difficult.  We have been working on D&aacute;il reform and getting very close to the decisions on a number of occasions.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessor did a lot of work on this and we brought it to the D&aacute;il reform committee.  Subsequently at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, the Fianna F&aacute;il members came out in force and all voted it down despite the fact that it came from the Ceann Comhairle and that the Whips, in their meeting on D&aacute;il reform committee, had agreed this package of fairly minor changes.  They voted them down.  A similar thing happened at the CPP where Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn brought to the attention of that committee that Ministers were answering only half of their questions.  It was agreed by everybody at the CPP this was a bad practice and the staff were asked to go away and draw up the necessary changes in Standing Orders.  </P>
        <P>I know what the Ceann Comhairle is going to say.  I am not used to Question Time.</P><Col N="211"/>
        <P>Is the Minister aware that following all that procedure, the Fianna F&aacute;il members of the CPP, even those I did not know were members, were whipped in and voted it down solidly?  Further, is he aware &mdash; I am sure he is because he was present at the meeting before last of the CPP &mdash; that he was asked, as Minister of State and chairman of the D&aacute;il reform committee, to deal with that specific issue and come back to the next meeting with that proposal?  That would be a sign of his good will and that he is really interested in D&aacute;il reform.  I would have deep suspicions about a Government package, prepared by the people on the list I have.  I do not see any value in it.  I hope the Minister will agree with me that there is no value in it in a bilateral context.  I presume the document is complicated and I shall need to refer a copy of it to my party before we can proceed further with it.  Let the Minister of State not expect this to be stampeded through.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s contribution did not culminate in a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a general comment and I will respond to it.  It should not be inferred from anything I have said or tried to convey that I am trying to stampede anything through.  In response specifically to Deputy Stanton, I asked how to deal with the entire package being worked on by the sub-committee dealing with D&aacute;il reform, which had advanced over a number of meetings, if there was no progression.  Deputy Stanton asked specifically if I would consider it on an incremental basis.  I am prepared to do so, which is not to suggest for a moment that I intend to stampede anything through.</P>
        <P>I intend to convene a meeting of the sub-committee dealing with D&aacute;il reform and although I have not sat on the committee, I have read the minutes.  Before doing so I intend to have bilateral meetings with the various Whips on the committee to get a sense of their priorities and the way they see the issue.  Listening to the contributions and questions from the two previous speakers, there is some difference of opinion on whether the process can be achieved incrementally.  I intend to propose the series of bilateral meetings to brief myself as much as anything else.  I do not for a moment agree, and I would not like it to be suggested, that the purpose is to stampede through a range of reforms.</P>
        <P>It was suggested that it may be necessary to do this through diktat.  I have not been here as long as Deputy Stagg but I recognise that the procedures in this Chamber must be improved.  Efficiencies in the way we do our business are possible and would benefit everybody, not just the Government side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will ask specific questions about the Minister of State&rsquo;s intentions.  He is aware of the position here every Thursday morning, when party leaders try to devise something within the existing restrictive Standing Orders to ask Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  Does the Minister of State agree this needs to be addressed immediately to allow Leaders&rsquo; Questions on a Thursday morning?  The Minister is probably aware that the Labour Party may have some responsibility for the current position as we agreed to the Taoiseach being absent on a Thursday morning.  The Taoiseach does not have to be present for Leaders&rsquo; Questions and the <i>de facto</i> position, as the Ceann Comhairle is well aware, is that there are Leaders&rsquo; Questions now on a Thursday morning and the issue should be formalised.</P>
        <P>The Order of Business is the only device available to Members of the House to raise current issues and they must try to find a Bill to attach to the interested matter.  Does the Minister of State agree that it would be desirable to have time for discussing current issues in the D&aacute;il at the time we are pretending to talk about the Order of Business but actually debating current issues?</P>
        <P>The other matter, referred to by Deputy Stanton, is the Adjournment Debate, which is now farcical.  Ministers or Ministers of State who do not know anything about a subject simply read a script which was badly prepared by some civil servant who is not politically or directly <Col N="212"/>involved, or who does not know about the issues.  No supplementary questions are allowed and this needs immediate reform.  I ask the Minister of State to include such matters in a package.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State has included the next issue in the package, and if not, he should include it.  It concerns quangos, of which there are approximately 200, and to which we vote public money.  Ministers are responsible for them.  I ask that this House be given back the authority given by the public and the people who sent us here to ask questions about the spending of that public money.  There are devices at committee level to do so but the primary function of Members of the House is to ask questions about State bodies under the remit of various Ministers, with Ministers having the responsibility to answer.  I ask the Minister of State to include that in his D&aacute;il reform package, which I hope will be circulated in order to discuss it before the meeting of the sub-committee.  Is the Minister of State aware that prior to the establishment of the HSE, we could ask a question in the House about health issues and they were answered in three days?  The current Minister has installed a parliamentary section in the HSE but it takes as much as two months to get an answer.  Sometimes, I have been telephoned to be criticised for tabling a question in the first place.</P>
        <P>The Minister tells us she is referring a question to the HSE.  After there has been no answer for one, two or three months, a Deputy asks the question again, but he or she gets the same answer about referring it to the HSE.  This situation is unsatisfactory and does not hold the HSE to account by method of parliamentary inquiry, as should be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s first point was about Thursday mornings and the lack of Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  While there is none, there is an Order of Business.  Recently, the scope of matters raised on the Order of Business has broadened.  The Deputy asked whether I would give a commitment to introducing this type of questioning on Thursday, but I will answer him exactly as I answered Deputy Stanton &mdash; &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I will not cherry-pick pieces today and do X, Y and Z.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Minister of State to put it into the Government&rsquo;s D&aacute;il reform package.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an item for consideration.  At times, it might be believed that there is not much progress.  Given the complexity, trying to achieve an overall agreement has proven difficult.  This is not my experience, but the experience of those who went before me.  On 18 November, the standing Sub-committee on D&aacute;il Reform had a comprehensive meeting.  I will not read out everything, only the main headings.  It had a substantial consideration of a range of D&aacute;il reform proposals that would have seen business commencing at 11 a.m. on Tuesdays with a commencement debate, confined business, oral parliamentary questions and so forth.  On Wednesdays, the D&aacute;il would have commenced at 9.30 a.m. with a commencement debate, 30-second questions and Government business.  On Thursdays, the D&aacute;il would also have started at 9.30 a.m.  The sub-committee explained what the commencement debate would be, supplementary questions, oral questions and Questions to An Taoiseach.  I will not read out the full list, but it was comprehensive.</P>

	<P>I will read into the record what occurred.  The sub-committee went through everything.  Without being smart, this is the reason I want a series of bilateral meetings.  I am restricted to what I am reading in the minutes.</P>
        <P>The sub-committee addressed a range of issues.  It has resumed its consideration of proposals and agreed the routine of business for each day.  According to the minutes, the Labour Party Whip stated that while he was in general agreement with what I have outlined, a final agreement could only be reached if it was agreed that first, legislative or appropriate amendments to Standing Orders be put in place in order for parliamentary questions to be allowed in respect of the activities of State-sponsored bodies and, second, Leaders&rsquo; Questions be allowed on Thursdays.</P>
        <P>There seemed to be progress on many issues but different issues were then raised.  I am reading from the minutes.</P>

	<P>Will the Government consider constitutional or legislative change to compel Governments, now and in the future, to uphold the right of all of the electorate to its franchise?  I am referring to the issue of by-elections resulting from the demise or departure of sitting Members of this Chamber.  We are almost 12 months on from the creation of such a vacancy as a result of the European Union elections of last year, namely, in the constituency of Donegal South-West.  Is it not an imperative of the Government to act within a reasonable and, by way of a constitutional or legislative change, a set time to hold the said by-election in order to ensure that each constituency has the full allocated representation commensurate with its population?</P>
     <P Just="Left">The Minister of State may recall my attempt a couple of weeks ago to move the writ to the Donegal South-West by-election was unsuccessful when the Ceann Comhairle used his casting vote and that he indicated at that time it was not possible to do so because it would be a distraction for Members from the current difficulties in the economy.  The Government addresses with haste vacancies occurring in the Upper House, the Seanad.  It is interesting that there appears to be a two-tier system or twin track approach on the part of Government in respect of vacancies occurring in the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;Members of which must surely be as concerned about the economy as are Members of the D&aacute;il yet, there has been a 12 month delay in regard to the holding of this by-election.  There are currently three by-elections outstanding.  Will the Minister of State accept that whatever the reason behind the Government&rsquo;s dilatoriness in regard to these by-elections, it is important, as measure of D&aacute;il reform, that we have a stipulated and respectful timeframe in regard to same following the demise or departure of a Member of the House, one that is reasonable and will allow the electorate in the relevant constituency fill that vacancy and that it no longer be the preserve of Government to suit its own interests or expediency?</P>

	<P>A question, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>My second question relates to another important scuppered reform, namely, the stated intent of former Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern to provide an opportunity for elected Members North of the Border to participate in a committee of the D&aacute;il.  This was announced by the former Taoiseach in 2005 and was due to come into effect in early 2006.  As then indicated by the former Taoiseach, there were other parties to the Government and other voices in this House that were unsettled at the prospect of MPs from North of the Border constituencies having an opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to conclude with a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to participate in this Chamber.  The question, which I have already put in part, is obvious.  Will the Government now reconsider, following on the recent Westminster election results North of the Border and in recognition of the contribution so far of the five successful candidates returned as abstentionist republican MPs &mdash; as were all of those who attended the Mansion House on 21 January 1919 &mdash; in regard to the Good Friday Agreement Implementation Committee, the objections raised by the then Deputies and others, as advised by the former Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must remember that this is Question Time and he must put a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Ceann Comhairle to allow me to finish my question.  These are major reforms that must take place, ones which, whether or not the Ceann Comhairle likes them, are important.  His direct participation in respect of one of them only a couple of weeks ago must underscore that fact.  I want to know if the Government is now willing to revisit the proposition put forward by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, to allow MPs North of the Border to participate with Members of this House in discussions here on matters of an all-Ireland and cross-Border nature?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I wish to make a distinction on the type of questions asked by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, in that they primarily pertain to electoral reform rather than reform of D&aacute;il procedures <i>per se</i>, which primarily is what is being addressed here, that is, how Members do their business.  As for the broader issue of electoral reform, both the programme for Government and the revised programme for Government indicated clearly that an independent electoral commission would be established.  Many of the issues raised by the Deputy, such as his specific questions on timeframes for by-elections and so forth, would be more appropriately dealt with by that electoral commission.  I understand that consultations on its establishment are progressing under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the Deputy specifically asked about the participation of MPs elected in Northern Ireland in committees of this House on cross-Border or all-island issues.  Since taking up this position, I have not considered this issue specifically to date.  My sole focus has been on the reform of procedures in this House but as a matter of courtesy and in response to the question raised by the Deputy, I certainly will consider this matter and revert to him.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the reason D&aacute;il reform is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a supplementary question for the Minister of State.  This is not about asking for electoral reform.  I ask that the right of the electorate be upheld in respect of the numeric representation to which each constituency is entitled.  If D&aacute;il reform is under consideration, surely one of the principal requirements must be that all Members accept the right of the electorate to choose its representation.  For the past 12 months, the Government has been denying&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, we must avail of another time on which to discuss this matter in more detail.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="216"/>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This pertains to D&aacute;il reform.  Just because the Ceann Comhairle is uncomfortable with its focus does not exclude the question as invalid.  The question is absolutely valid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy ventilated this issue quite significantly in his earlier contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not received a satisfactory answer.  I repeat my question, will the Government recognise the right of the electorate of Donegal South-West and of all the other constituencies in which by-elections are pending by ensuring in future, following the demise or departure of a Member of this House, that a set timeframe period is put in place either by legislation or constitutional change by referendum?  Will the current practice, which is an absolute outrage, be brought to an end?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has undertaken to revert to me on the second matter I raised.  I now ask him to address the first issue, which is not a matter for the electoral commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief in an effort to accommodate everyone.  I reiterate that the point the Deputy has again raised with regard to by-elections, timings and so forth is very much an issue for the independent electoral commission that is to be established.  It will be very much within its remit to make such recommendations.  I reiterate that, in respect of cross-Border representation, I will revert to the Deputy.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, well in his new job as Government Chief Whip.  I am sure he will take on board the concerns as outlined by Members both today and at the sub-committee.</P>
        <P>When I hear of D&aacute;il reform under the current procedures, I think of Emperor Nero, fires and cities in Italy and that this matter is not being taken seriously.  At 5.30 p.m., when everyone else is heading home from work, we will be arguing about the Order of Business.  That is surely testament to the total irrelevance of this place.  The reason I came into the House was that in the initial reply, the Minister of State mentioned making a submission on D&aacute;il reform to Cabinet.  Cabinet has no place in D&aacute;il reform, this is the D&aacute;il, it does not relate to Cabinet reform.  If submissions are made to Cabinet, they will come back with the stamp of Government Ministers, that is the problem.  It is the abdication of responsibility on the part of Ministers, the Minister for Health and Children being the worst culprit, with Ministers having no regard at all for the procedures of the House or its constitutional position in terms of answerability.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned Adjournment debates.  There are 12 such debates per week.  Looking back over the last 50 such debates, how many Cabinet Ministers attended and answered questions addressed to them by Members of this House?  I guarantee I could count the number of such occasions on the fingers of one hand.</P><Col N="217"/>
        <P Just="Left">I was out of this House for five years.  I came back in 2007 and I can say that standards in this place have dropped.  The attitude of the Government towards Parliament has decreased considerably and that should change.  If the Minister of State can achieve that on his watch, he will leave a mark.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The debate about D&aacute;il reform is amusing when Independent Deputies are not allowed to speak regularly.  The Minister of State should examine that.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said he would meet all the political parties.  Would he meet the Independent Members, who are not allowed to speak regularly on Private Members&rsquo; time and legislation?  Is the Minister of State aware that Independent Members such as myself, Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan and Deputy Joe Behan are furious that our democratic rights are not respected in this House? He must do something to protect those rights.</P>
        <P>We must discuss current issues every day and become more involved in them.  D&aacute;il procedures are out of date and out of touch with people on the ground.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>While looking at reform of the D&aacute;il, would the Minister of State examine the committee system, particularly the compellability of witnesses?  At the moment, Foynes Harbour Board is refusing to answer questions in front of the Joint Committee on Transport on its annual statement and CIE and Irish Rail refuse to answer important questions on their audits.  Either these quangos are accountable to the Oireachtas or they are not.  At present they refuse to be accountable.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport clearly instructed the National Roads Authority not to build service areas but he still refuses to answer questions on this matter in the D&aacute;il on the grounds he has no responsibility for the area.  It is an absolute joke.  I urge the Minister of State to crack the whip, get the job done and get Ministers and quangos to answer questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the status of the working group on D&aacute;il reform that the Government established on D&aacute;il reform in 2009, comprising the Minister for Transport, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Senator Dan Boyle and the Government Chief Whip of the day?  When did it last meet?  This is probably the weakest Parliament in Europe in terms of holding the Executive to account.  The Executive controls everything &mdash; the agenda, sitting times and dates, how matters are debated and for how long.  Has the Minister of State looked at other Parliaments in Europe and does he not agree that the D&aacute;il is one of weakest?  We live in a benign dictatorship.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not even that benign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Flanagan, I hope the Order of Business today goes somewhat better and that at 5.30 p.m. we will have progressed beyond it.</P>
        <P>On a serious note, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd asked about reform of the committees and compellability of witnesses.  I understand that constitutional issues arise in this regard which need to be developed and teased out.  We did not really discuss this matter here and at times we do ourselves no favours, as we discuss the procedures of the House but there is a parallel committee system and many of the committees perform invaluable work.  It is often stated that Ministers are not held to account but as a Minister of State I was certainly held to account and quizzed as I was developing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>They refuse to answer the questions, that is the point.  They refuse to answer committee questions stating they are not obliged to answer them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I state this by way of being helpful.  They refuse to answer questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I had considerable experience during the development of the national drugs strategy, when I appeared before the relevant committee and answered specific questions on an ongoing basis.  The committee system is far superior to the thrust of what goes on here with regard to the detail that might be required.  We did not discuss the committee system when we spoke about reform but we should not undermine its importance and the importance of the attendance of relevant Ministers.</P>
        <P>Deputy Finian McGrath asked about the Independent Members.  I had not intended to speak to them because they were not part of the standing Sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform, which has met on eight occasions.  That being said, given the fact that Deputy McGrath has requested it I will arrange a meeting to elicit their views.  I was not a member of the Sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform, but rather than reading the transcript of its decisions I wanted to try to understand the level of debate and what was going on at it.  The working group to which Deputy Stanton referred last met in July 2009.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year, the HSE dealt with almost 1.2 million emergency department presentations and it expects to do the same again this year.  Approximately 70% of people who attended emergency departments were not admitted to hospital; they were treated and discharged.  This year, the HSE is planning to increase the number who can be safely discharged home without admission to about 72%.  This can be achieved by changing the way services are provided, including by providing quicker access to senior clinical decisions makers.</P>
        <P>I am determined to move to a consultant provided, rather than a consultant led, service where consultants work on a team basis.  As a result, and following agreement in 2008 on a new consultant contract, I have made it clear to the HSE that it needs to increase the number of consultants and reduce the number of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, to achieve a more appropriate balance between both groups.  I am also determined to support the changes in the NCHD training status and associated medical registration status being introduced by the Medical Council under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.</P>
        <P>I have been advised that there are likely to be difficulties in filling some NCHD posts when doctors begin their next rotation in early July.  The indications are that there will be a reduction in the number of applications for certain NCHD posts, especially in posts which are not part of a formal training rotation scheme and in the areas of emergency medicine, anaesthesia and general medicine.  However, the extent of any shortfall will only become evident over the coming weeks.</P><Col N="219"/>
        <P>It is because of the expected reductions in applications for NCHD posts, and not because of any budgetary challenges that the HSE is currently examining how best to maintain and improve the quality of services provided to patients attending emergency departments.  A range of possible measures are being examined, including some relating to recruitment and training status.  Other important measures include reductions in tiered on-call and improved cross-cover arrangements.  Instead of cases being referred through successive tiers of doctors, we need to increase the extent to which consultants and other senior clinical decision makers respond to urgent or emergency cases.</P>
        <P>As we are serious about patient safety we also have to ensure that acute care is dealt with appropriately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I often have disagreements about what is a question and what is an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible to disagree with the Chair.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I put it to the Minister that the question is quite clear.  It asks the Minister about her plans to limit accident and emergency services as a result of the cutbacks and shortage of doctors; if she will identify each hospital affected by these plans, which she failed to do; if she supports the action &mdash; she failed to say whether she did; if she is concerned about the impact this will have on patient care; and the details of the contingency plans.  If she is not in a position to answer verbally today I would like her to submit to me a written answer outlining what hospitals are affected because we are hearing of hospitals all around the country which are being affected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been changes in the visa system which mitigate against non-consultant hospital doctors, who in the past paid a fee and were issued with a visa for two years but are now only being issued with a visa for three months.  Can the Minister inform us why that is the case?  We are discussing further cutbacks and the European working time directive at a time when the coroner in Kildare is writing to the HSE to highlight the overcrowded nature of our accident and emergency departments after hearing that an 86 year old woman died after a 36 hour wait on a hospital trolley in the accident and emergency department in Naas General Hospital.  She was admitted with a suspected hip fracture and uncharacteristic confusion in February 2009.  The Minister sent two HSE executives to Galway to help resolve problems with patients in the accident and emergency department there and the HSE plans to close a further 1,100 beds.</P>
        <P>How will the Minister achieve what she said she would achieve?  I note in her answer she referred to putting in place proper community facilties.  They are not there.  The fair deal, which was intended to make more space available to people is now being used to close public long-term care facilities and we cannot have it for the private citizens.  Does the Minister support these actions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked a whole host of questions.  A number of issues are affecting the staffing of hospitals.  The first is the working time directive, which is now Irish and European law.  It is being implemented for patient safety reasons because we do not want <Col N="220"/>overworked doctors attending patients.  Under the new Medical Practitioners Act there is a fundamental change in the training of junior hospital doctors which is having an impact.  </P>
        <P>On the question of visas, I have had good discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about reverting to a two year visa, and it is agreeable to that.  We are currently awaiting a response from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and I understand we will have it shortly.</P>
        <P>On the wider issue, I had a meeting recently with the HSE.  It is examining a number of scenarios.  Obviously, it is obliged to commit itself to the 2010 service plan, and that it will do.  It states we will reduce admissions from accident and emergency departments to hospital beds by 33,000, which is approximately 2% of the numbers who present at accident and emergency.  There are a number of community facilities.  As the Deputy probably knows, recently the Mater Hospital opened a facility to deal with minor injuries which has been highly successful.  The volumes of patients attending it is in excess of anything which could have been anticipated.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives are under way.  The HSE is due to revert to me shortly.  I do not have the answer to the question on what accident and emergency departments are closing, which the Deputy would love to get.  There is no plan to close any accident and emergency departments on foot of the restrictions which are taking place.  There may be restrictions.  The same issues are being faced in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  This week Northern Ireland announced the closure of two accident and emergency departments for similar reasons.  We will not close facilties, rather, we will make sure the facilties which are in place provide safe and appropriate care and those that require emergency care are dealt with in the appropriate place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The appropriate place, with 300 people lying on trolleys every single day, is not very satisfactory.  Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd is from the Louth constituency, in which a new accident and emergency department which is lying idle was built in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda.  When will it open?  Why has the reduction in services not been outlined?  They were not mentioned in the HSE national service plan.  We knew the working time directive would be introduced and there would be a shortage of non-consultant hospital doctors.  Why has this not been highlighted?</P>
        <P>I understand there will now be integrated service areas, rather than what we have had to date, such as the HSE south.  There is now talk of having 18 service areas with populations of 225,000 to 250,000.  One such area might affect the constituency of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Wexford.  Others might affect Waterford, Kilkenny, Clonmel, south Tipperary and Carlow.  Could the Minister inform the House whether she is in favour of the new initiative?  If so, how many will there be and when will they come into being?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>On Drogheda, the facility is ready.  There are issues in terms of recruiting staff and industrial relations.  The process will happen this year and money is being provided for that.  I do not have the precise opening date for the new facility.  I had discussions yesterday with INMO and hope that the current staff could move into the new facility to provide the services which are currently being provided in a facility which is not fit for purpose as we ramp up to get additional staff, in particular paediatric nurses.  The process of recruitment will happen this year and the facility will open.</P>
        <P>On the integrated service areas, everything we have been trying to do is to integrate services between the hospital and the community.  In some regions of the country, such as the west, we spend &euro;2 billion on health and have 27,000 employees.  It makes sense that they would work in an integrated fashion.  If we are to move staff, which is part of the Croke Park agreement, from <Col N="221"/>the hospital to the community in order that services can be provided there, we need to operate on that basis.  If memory serves me correctly, I understand there will be 18 to 24 service areas over the next period of years.  It will not happen fast; it will take a considerable amount of time, as the Deputy is aware.</P>
        <P>The purpose of an integrated service area is to integrate all the public health services which are happening in a coherent fashion in order that we do not have a situation where the hospital is not encouraged to give somebody something to which he or she is entitled because it will come from its budget and it pushes the problem out into the community where it can be paid for out of another organisation&rsquo;s budget or <i>vice versa</i>.  That is the kind of confusion which exists when we do not integrate the services we provide.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>  the advice she will give to hospitals such as Beaumont whose financial allocation is not adequate to address the needs of patients in their catchment area; the way in which patients are to be protected when wards and theatres are closed and accident and emergency departments are overcrowded and understaffed and when there are growing waiting times for outpatient clinics and for elective procedures; if she will intervene to ensure that patient welfare is not compromised; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[20560/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been assured that Beaumont Hospital will meet its service plan targets for 2010.  These involve treating the same number of patients this year as last but with less reliance on inpatient stays.  In turn this will involve reducing inappropriate hospital admissions, more same day of surgery admissions, more day care cases, earlier discharges and reductions in waiting times for elective surgery.  The planned changes announced by Beaumont are designed to allow it deliver its service plan targets while remaining within its budget.  For example, the increase in day case activity and the reduction in beds occupied by long-stay patients means the hospital can treat the same number of patients as previously with fewer in-patient beds.  Beaumont has also assured my Department that neurosurgery, transplantation and cancer services will not be affected by the changes.</P>
        <P>Treating people in more efficient and effective ways like this, with no reduction in access to appropriate services, is obviously the right thing to do given the very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer.  However, it is also the right thing for patients.  People want to access quality care as quickly as possible and be allowed to go home as soon as possible.  There are constant calls inside and outside this House for a more efficient public service, changes in work practices and greater productivity.  Despite this, we still hear opposition to such changes, with the focus being put instead on issues like the number of in-patient beds rather than the number of patients being treated and the achievement of best outcomes for patients.</P>
        <P>Reforming the way services are provided, reducing costs and maintaining a clear focus on patient safety will allow us to treat people in more effective ways and protect access to appropriate services.  I want to make it clear to this House that the implementation by Beaumont Hospital, and other hospitals, of this type of patient-centred reform will have my full support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I put it to the Minister that on 29 March 2006 she issued a statement declaring accident and emergency departments to be a national emergency.  In 2007 she stated that the HSE said no patient should be waiting more than 24 hours in any accident and emergency unit for admission to a ward and by next year the target is to be a maximum of six hours.  The HSE also stated its aim is that no accident and emergency unit should have more than ten patients waiting for admission to a ward.  She has again given us a beautiful flow of rhetoric. <Col N="222"/> The reality is totally different.  How, with 52 fewer beds, will Beaumont achieve the target she has outlined to us?  How will other hospitals throughout the country achieve their targets?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to the fair deal and the fact that people will be able to leave hospital more easily.  I spoke to a social worker who was working in another large Dublin hospital last week who told me that most of her day is now spent trying to deal with the financial assessments of the fair deal to get elderly patients who are ready to be discharged out of hospital .  What is the Minister going to do to ensure that the financial assessment element of the fair deal does not keep people in hospital unnecessarily?  I am told that nursing homes will not take them until it is certain they will qualify.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, will address the fair deal scheme, I will only make a brief comment on it.  We were dealing with a large volume of applications which came in at the same time because the scheme was only introduced last October.  In many cases, court and other legal procedures are involved because we have to deal with people who have diminished mental capacities.</P>
        <P>We are receiving a fantastic response on the fair deal scheme.  It has freed up 50 beds in Beaumont hospital alone and we are currently awaiting HIQA registration before allowing that hospital to open St. Joseph&rsquo;s, which will provide a further 100 beds.  Beaumont has dealt with 1,000 more patients on a day case basis over the first four months of this year than it did during the same period last year.  By moving to same day surgery and day case activity, more patients can be treated within available budgets.</P>
        <P>Of course accident and emergency provision is not perfect but I can outline data that show year-on-year improvements in the waiting time target of six hours from time of arrival to either being sent home or admitted.  Many hospitals meet that target but, unfortunately, approximately six hospitals are not in a position to do so for various reasons and these institutions are now receiving special attention from the HSE at my request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>More than 300 people were accommodated on trolleys on one day last week.  That is the average figure for the month of May, when normally the number of people on trolleys is very small.  Despite the Minister&rsquo;s claims about what hospitals will be able to achieve, year after year we see the same statistics.  We are not seeing improvements in trolley figures.  The same difficulties arise in terms of moving people from accident and emergency units to wards, even where they are ready to be transferred.  Given the level of cutbacks with which hospitals must contend, does she really believe they will be able to achieve the targets she is setting for them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe hospitals can meet the 2010 service plan to which the HSE is committed.  I referred specifically to Beaumont, which is a national tertiary referral centre.  The financial pressures are enormous and although we have provided some new money for the fair deal scheme, comparing like with like, we have taken an additional &euro;1 billion from the HSE over last year.  Approximately &euro;630 million of that comes from staff reductions and the remainder has to come from value-for-money, reductions in drug costs, etc.  Notwithstanding these pressures, the activity level at Beaumont was higher over the first four months of this year than in the same period last year.</P>

        <Quest>  if the VHI fulfilled its legal obligation to achieve solvency by the end of March 2010 deadline set by herself; the number of times she has extended the deadline for VHI to achieve required reserves to date; <Col N="223"/>if the EU Competition Commissioner has contacted her concerning a possible legal action and sanctions if VHI does not meet the requirements of the Financial Regulator regarding appropriate levels of solvency; the potential sanctions against the State from the EU in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[20716/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from a derogation under the non-life insurance directives, VHI continues to be exempt from prudential solvency requirements.  The Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2008 provided for the VHI to acquire sufficient funding in terms of its capital reserves to enable it to make an application to the Financial Regulator for authorisation.  The date originally fixed by that Act was 31 December 2008 but this was subject to the right of the Minister to appoint a later date by order if satisfied that there is good and sufficient reason for so doing.  At the time the original date was fixed, the Supreme Court had not yet ruled on the risk equalisation scheme, which it struck down in July 2008.  Since then I have extended the date by which the VHI must accrue the necessary reserves on five occasions.  The date is now 1 January 2012.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission has commenced proceedings against the State in the European Court of Justice regarding the VHI&rsquo;s derogation.  The State has forwarded a comprehensive written defence to the court and fully intends to mount a vigorous defence of its action.  The matter of sanctions would only arise in the event of an adverse judgment if nothing was done to ameliorate the situation and further proceedings were then brought to seek financial penalties against the State.</P>
        <P>The capital position and authorisation of the VHI are only two of many interrelated and complex issues that need to be resolved in order to achieve a stable community rated private health insurance market.  I have been examining the broad range of issues involved with my officials, expert advisers and the Health Insurance Authority.  The matter has also been considered by the Government on a number of occasions since the Supreme Court judgment.  I will make a full statement at the appropriate time on the measures required to support the Government&rsquo;s key policy goal of a community rated health insurance market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to indicate to the House the solvency target for the VHI in monetary and percentage terms and the level of solvency achieved by the company by the end of March 2010.  Does she see any inconsistency between the State&rsquo;s treatment of the VHI, in respect of which it once again extended the deadline for solvency, and of Quinn Insurance?  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> cites Se&aacute;n Murphy, the deputy chief executive of Chambers Ireland, as agreeing that the situation &ldquo;clearly isn&rsquo;t fair&rdquo; and Tom Carney, a partner with Dillon Eustace, as stating:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">It emphasises the stark contrast between the State&rsquo;s regulatory approach towards Quinn and that of the VHI.  One company is completely and utterly exempted from solvency arrangements, while, on the other hand, another company is in permanent administration &mdash; and both companies are pursuing the same market.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Perhaps the Minister can inform the House how many times she has extended the deadline.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I introduced the legislation on the deadline but that was prior to the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision to strike down risk equalisation.  I want to point out some facts.  We are discussing the reserves ratio.  The VHI has 82% of the over 60s market and 92% of the over 90s market.  I strongly favour community rated health insurance because it allows older and sicker people to afford insurance on the same basis as younger customers.  If we are to retain that system, it will require intergenerational support.  The scheme which was introduced when the market was opened up to competition on foot of an EU requirement was, unfortu<Col N="224"/>nately, struck down by the Supreme Court in 2008.  That changed everything and, in the interim, we have introduced tax relief at source.</P>
        <P>I remain determined to bring before the Government shortly a comprehensive set of measures not only in respect of the capital requirements of the VHI but also on a sustainable financial model for the company.  If one company has an unfair risk burden, we clearly will not have a market that is capable of being fair in all circumstances.  We need a new risk equalisation scheme in Ireland and in the meantime we have provided for a scheme of tax relief at source which has been approved by the EU as a temporary measure.  We also need to sort out the VHI&rsquo;s capital requirements and the three companies&rsquo; respective market ratios.  The ratios vary considerably at present but I would like to see a healthier market where at least three players have similar shares.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the financial pressures we currently face, it is encouraging that only 1.6% of people have dropped out of health insurance.  This is because we keep insurance costs affordable, particularly for older and sicker people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I contend that the reason 53% of the people in this country take out private health insurance is because they do not have any faith in the public system to deliver in a timely fashion.  I do not wish to do a disservice to the late and very brave Susie Long but people do not want to find themselves in her situation.  Otherwise, how could one explain the decision?  Our hospitals are supposed to provide a system of free secondary health care but this a virtual system.  It is not available to our citizens, who as a result, wait months and years for outpatient appointments.</P>
        <P>As the Minister failed to answer, I remind her that this is the sixth time that she extended the deadline.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I said &ldquo;five&rdquo; in my reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>She has admitted that the market is not fair.  Given that the VHI&rsquo;s shortfall is estimated at over &euro;200 million, might it indeed face the same fate as Quinn Insurance?  I do not believe we have a fair market and that is why we do not have more players.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not have a fair market if some participants have to carry the burden of older and sicker people.  That is a fact.  There are other unfair aspects to the market.  I want to see a market that is fair to all the players.  Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s party favours providing private health insurance to everybody but that is also based on a risk equalisation model.  </P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The renewed programme for government re-affirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the current co-location programme.  Preferred bidders have been selected for six co-location projects at Beaumont Hospital, Cork University Hospital, Limerick Regional Hospital, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Sligo Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital.  Project agreements have been signed for the projects in Beaumont, Cork, Limerick and St James&rsquo;s.  Planning permission has been granted for the first three of these projects.  Planning permission has been granted by the local authority for the St James&rsquo;s project but this has recently been appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Two other projects are at earlier stages of the procurement process.</P>
        <P>The co-location programme is a complex public procurement process.  It is a matter for each successful bidder to arrange its finance under the terms of the relevant project agreement.  The co-location initiative, like other major projects, has to deal with the changed funding environment.  The HSE is continuing to work with the successful bidders to provide whatever assistance it can to help them advance the projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  It is timely that we should discuss the matter because, as my colleague, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan mentioned a few weeks ago, we are heading towards the fifth anniversary of the announcement of the plan, which was to fast track the 1,000 public beds.  Not a single brick has been laid, a sod turned or a bed delivered.  Will the Minister confirm whether finance has been secured for the projects and when construction will begin?  Will she remind the House of the total cost to the State of tax reliefs for co-located hospitals, should they go ahead?  The banking and finance situation has not been resolved.  We have been waiting five years.  As I indicated, this is yet another of those great promises on which there has been a failure to deliver.  It would be as well for the Minister to put her hands up and advise us that she will find some other way of putting beds into the system because if this is a fast-track approach, God help Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had a credit crunch and it is difficult to get access to private finance for many projects.  People are working extremely hard to advance the projects.  There is great enthusiasm for them in various parts of the country to provide not just extra capacity by way of acute hospital beds but to allow acute hospitals to be able to reconfigure within themselves to have more private rooms and more infection control rooms.  There is no other plan, nor are any resources available for major capital investment in public hospitals.  That is a <Col N="226"/>fact.  This remains the only plan for major investment in major, acute public hospitals for the foreseeable future.  Bankers and project promoters are working closely together.  I hope we will be in a position to see the advancement of some of the projects shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Five years later, there is no real prospect of that happening.  I disagree fundamentally with the Minister&rsquo;s point that no other funding is available.  There is gross wastage within the Health Service Executive and the health budget.  If the funding was directed appropriately and managed properly the funding would be available.  I remind the Minister that she promised the House previously that she would add beds to the system, instead of which we have lost beds.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to 33,000 fewer emergency admissions.  Can she explain to the House how in the name of God she is going to reduce 33,000 emergency admissions in the health service this year?  Is the Minister saying consultants in emergency medicine are admitting people needlessly?  I do not think they nor any other doctor in the country would accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Reilly represents every second vested interest that opposes any change in the health system proposed in this House.  I already replied to a question on Beaumont Hospital.  An extra 1,000 day-case patients were treated there in the first quarter of this year compared with last year.  Reductions will be achieved by hospitals doing things differently, such as bringing in people on the same day for surgery.  Approximately 3% of admissions from accident and emergency units are for diagnostics.  It is a case of doing all of those things.  We should not get obsessed about the number of beds.  It is about the money following not just the patient but the patient&rsquo;s best health.  That does not always mean that the patients should be in a hospital &mdash; far from it &mdash; it means the patient getting access to the appropriate treatment he or she needs wherever he or she requires it.  Often that is in a community non-hospital environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the publication last week of the ombudsman&rsquo;s report on Children First.  The report identifies many of the implementation difficulties highlighted in previous reviews of the Children First guidelines.  It acknowledges that planned and substantial steps were taken to implement the guidelines but also that efforts to drive forward implementation were not always sustained and were not sufficient at particular times.  The investigation found that insufficient efforts were made by the HSE to drive forward implementation of the guidelines and identified the failure of the former health boards to resolve problems arising with Children First, including variable implementation.  The report is also critical of the degree of inter-agency oversight and the role of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in this regard.  The adverse findings focus in particular on the period 2003 to 2007.</P><Col N="227"/>
        <P>The Children First guidelines have now been revised and take into account the findings of previous reviews and some comments put forward by the ombudsman.  The newly revised guidelines will be supported by a detailed and comprehensive implementation framework which will apply across all sectors.  This framework will include emphasis on robust implementation assurance systems including inspection and audits.  I will be bringing proposals to Government shortly in this regard.</P>
        <P>Successive Ministers have taken a series of initiatives since the publication of Children First in 1999 to improve the quality of children&rsquo;s lives and to protect children at risk.  The legislative and policy framework has been significantly strengthened through the passage of major pieces of legislation, such as the Children Act 2001, the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2007, and the continuing passage of new legislation through the Oireachtas including the Adoption Bill 2009 and the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2009.  Key policy initiatives include the agenda for children&rsquo;s services, the Government&rsquo;s implementation plan following the Ryan report, the Irish Youth Justice service strategy, the youth homelessness strategy, and the report of the working group on foster care.</P>
        <P>Major developments have also taken place at service level including the establishment and expansion of the Social Services Inspectorate under HIQA; the development of national standards for children in the care of the State; the continued development of special care units for vulnerable children, expansion of the Garda vetting services; the establishment of the children&rsquo;s services committees; the creation of a new management position in the HSE at senior management level with responsibility for child and family social services; the development of standardised service delivery and business processes within the HSE; the development of a knowledge management strategy for child welfare and protection services; and the development of a sustainable and cost-effective solution for the provision of out-of-hours services for garda&iacute; who remove children under section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991.  The Government is committed to building on the existing legislative and policy framework and to taking any additional actions deemed necessary to ensure greater protection for children at risk.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State not regard it as slightly odd, both in this House and in a statement he issued on the publication of the ombudsman&rsquo;s report, to welcome the publication of a report which makes two findings of maladministration or unsound administration against the Department in the area of child protection and nine findings of maladministration or unsound administration against the HSE with regard to implementation of the Children First guidelines?  Can the Minister of State explain, in the context of the first finding of unsound administration against his Department why, despite all the public statements made, for almost eight years little was done that mattered to ensure the uniform application of the Children First guidelines across the country?</P>
        <P>In respect of the second finding of unsound administration, can the Minister of State explain why he, the Minister, Deputy Harney, who is sitting beside him, and his predecessors as Ministers for children, either concealed and-or did nothing about an ongoing dispute involving the IMPACT trade union, originally the health boards in 2002 all the way up to today&rsquo;s date with the Health Service Executive, in which IMPACT directed social workers in various local health offices across the eastern region not to apply various parts of the Children First guidelines, to the detriment of children?  Why was that kept secret?  Why had there been no intervention of any description to resolve that dispute to ensure children are properly protected?</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcomed the report in the first instance because it is a good report which gives a good summary of the way in which efforts have been made to implement the Children First guidelines uniformly throughout the State.  I would not expect the Deputy to <Col N="228"/>refer to the positive progress identified by the ombudsman, particularly in reference to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  She observed that planned steps had been taken to implement the Children First guidelines and that those steps were substantial.  She further remarked that it was clear &ldquo;considerable efforts&rdquo; were made to implement the guidelines, particularly in the earlier years following its publication, and that the multitude of reviews point to the policy priority accorded their implementation by the Government.  She acknowledges that since 2008 considerable progress has been made in trying to tackle what is described as &ldquo;differential compliance&rdquo;.  I adverted to some of those developments in my reply.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I would certainly like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to the two questions raised.  Is he not ashamed of a report &mdash; which he describes as a good report &mdash; that documents total incompetence by the Health Service Executive and the Department in ensuring the application across the State of the Children First guidelines?  Is he not ashamed that the lessons that were supposed to have been learned from the tragic deaths of Tracey Fay and David Foley clearly were not learned?  Moreover, last weekend the remains of another young man, Daniel McAnaspie, were found.  I drew his case to the attention of the House last February, when the Minister of State criticised me for naming him and for expressing concern about his circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I expressed no such criticism of the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State not ashamed that a failure of the Health Service Executive to provide proper care to this young man has contributed to his tragic death?  Can he tell this House truthfully that everything possible has been done by the Government to ensure the application of the Children First guidelines since 1999?  Will he acknowledge that his party in government has failed to a scandalous and abysmal degree to protect children?  Will he indicate to the House that there will be an independent inquiry into the tragic death of Daniel McAnaspie and give an assurance that those appointed to it are not selected by the Health Service Executive?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I absolutely reject the Deputy&rsquo;s unfair claims.  The Government committed &euro;15 million to this area in the last budget at a time of retrenchment in almost every other Department and within the Department of Health and Children itself.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>This is 2010.  The guidelines introduced in 1999 have not yet been implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>That funding will be applied to the recruitment of 200 additional social workers.  Any fair analysis of this situation will show that I am absolutely committed to the delivery of improved compliance with the Children First guidelines.  That is central to the taskforce on the standardisation of business processes.  It is central to our commitment in the last budget to the roll-out of additional social workers and to the entire framework for the <Col N="229"/>implementation plan following the Ryan report.  The Children First guidelines are in and of themselves robust.  We must not only ensure compliance on a statutory footing with those guidelines but also ensure the capacity to audit the various sectors with responsibility for their delivery.</P>
        <P>In regard to the case of Daniel McAnaspie, I join with everybody in the House in expressing our deepest regret to his family on the tragedy that has befallen them.  I understand the Deputy intends to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  We will provide further details of our response at that time.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>  the progress she has made to date in drafting legislation to clarify eligibility for health and social services; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[20210/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The current legislation governing eligibility for health and personal social services has been in place since 1970.  The 1970 Health Act contains the now outdated concept of undue hardship as the basis for providing full eligibility for people who cannot arrange health care for themselves.  It is time to move to more modern concepts for the basis of public health care such as financial, medical or social need.</P>
        <P>Since 1970 there have been many developments in services with a growing emphasis on the delivery of care in community health rather than institutional settings.  For example, both in respect of public and privately funded services, the area of chronic disease management in the community is being given a higher profile than before.  To support this change, and better care for all patients, we must develop both the eligibility rules for public benefits and the minimum benefits regulations for health insurance.  Both of these, together, should be aligned towards the objective of better primary care and much better and more cost effective chronic disease management.</P>
        <P>It is important that people have clarity about what they can expect in public benefits and from health insurance policies, and that both these support best health care and outcomes for everyone.  The review of eligibility therefore dovetails with the development of minimum benefits for private health insurance.  Work in this area is at an advanced stage and I hope to bring proposals to the Government as soon as possible in the coming months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is useful to tease out what will be contained in this legislation which is extremely significant in terms of people&rsquo;s rights regarding health care.  We in the Opposition would prefer if it were decided that everybody, whether privately insured or not, has the same rights in the area of health care.  How comprehensive will the legislation be?  Will it deal with the mental health area, including, for example, the right of access to community mental health care within a particular timeframe?  Will the legislation specify timeframes within <Col N="230"/>which people will be entitled to receive care?  They have just left the Gallery but I intended to welcome the guests of the cross-party group on mental health who have come from several different countries.  They would be particularly interested to know whether mental health will be covered.</P>
        <P>Will the legislation include dental services?  People&rsquo;s right to dental care has been slashed even though, as I understand it, there is a right to comprehensive dental health care under the 1970 Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Deputy in welcoming the guests who have just departed.  I hope they will learn from us just as we learn from them.  The legislation will be as comprehensive as possible.  Although we have had some recent legislation on medical cards and long-term residential care, and legislation is imminent on prescription charges, there is clearly a need for comprehensive legislation on eligibility.  There are significant issues to be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not share the Deputy&rsquo;s view, even in the case of primary care, that there should in the short term be free access for everybody to everything.  If we were to send Deputy Reilly to negotiate with the Irish Medical Organisation, as he has done in the past, I would not like to imagine the costs he would come back with.  Within the available resources we must ensure that those at the bottom have access to all the services they require.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Adelaide Hospital Society has said it would require only an additional &euro;217 million to provide universal free access to primary care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the society whether that figure was based on negotiated costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The society has done its figures, although the Minister disputed that in <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say the society had not done its figures.  I simply said that nobody had negotiated with doctors as to what it would require to provide free access to primary care.  I have checked that out with a number of practitioners and have been shown salary levels that would frighten us all if I were to mention them here, salaries far in excess of what we earn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>A set figure has been indicated for every medical card patient.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We should bear in mind the cost of introducing medical cards for all those aged over 70 years.  I am simply saying that if we are going to move to salaried GPs, we must know what it will cost.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked whether the Bill will include dental and other services.  The intention is that it will be as comprehensive as possible.  I personally favour the concept of tiered benefits, with those at the bottom entitled to everything free of charge, those at the top paying the greater portion of their health care costs and those in the middle entitled to such facilities as the doctor-only card.  On dental services, contrary to comments made in this House and elsewhere, the figure for 2010 is the amount we spent in 2008.  For Deputies to suggest that represents a return to the Dark Ages is unfair and inaccurate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last point, there is tremendous confusion as to dental entitlements.  Dentists have been told by circular and other means, in very obtuse terms, that they <Col N="231"/>are to examine patients, and if it transpires that emergency treatment is required, then they will be paid, but they cannot know this until the examination is done.  That is a farce.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">On the substantive issue of eligibility, the Minister referred to chronic illness care.  There is no primary chronic illness care in this country other than the very limited Heartwatch programme.  We are paying lip service to the changes required in the community in order to ease the situation in hospitals and to change the way we deliver care, changes we all agree are necessary.  However, lip service does not provide services to patients.  The front page of the <i>Irish Medical News</i> indicated recently that there are two-year waiting lists for respiratory patients in Cork University Hospital.  Even the smallest hospital has a respiratory physician, yet people are waiting two years in Cork University Hospital.  The Minister wants to shove everything into that hospital.  Everything is being taken out of St. Mary&rsquo;s Orthopaedic Hospital and shoved into the South Infirmary hospital, with facilities being closed left, right and centre.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The discussion is straying from the issue of medical card eligibility. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Eligibility must be real rather than virtual, as is the case at present. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be real and will recognise the financial resources under which we must all operate and which some of the Deputy&rsquo;s policies do not appear to recognise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, they do. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy speaks as if we have an unlimited budget for an unlimited number of consultations, procedures and diagnostics.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question, the legislation is long overdue.  It is, however, a major piece of work on which considerable work has been done in my Department.  The proposals will be brought to Government shortly for decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Under the health strategy of 2001, a commitment was given to produce new legislation in 2002 to provide a legislative framework guaranteeing the entitlement to health care and personal social services of every citizen across the State.  The 2001 strategy indicated legislation would be produced in 2002.  Eight years later, why have we only received the Title of the Bill?  We are told in the new legislative programme that the heads of the Bill have not been agreed and it cannot be indicated when the legislation will be published.  Noting the Minister&rsquo;s response, I must ask whether there is any real intent on the part of the Government to publish the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill.  To clearly state the entitlements of citizens would run totally contrary to the Government&rsquo;s entire policy of promulgating a two-tier health system that provides for those who can afford it and denies to an ever growing number of people who simply cannot afford it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I totally refute the Deputy's assertion.  Everything we have done, including the new consultant contract, medical card arrangements, screening programmes and the establishment of the fair deal, was precisely to deal with people who did not have appropriate access to public facilities.  It remains my determination to continue to improve access to our public health services on the basis of medical need, rather than any other basis.  If we were to have a free-for-all, those at the bottom would not receive that to which they are entitled.</P>
        <P>On the specific question on the legislation, we remain determined to introduce the Bill and I hope a major advance will be made during this calendar year.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The board of the Health Service Executive is continuing the recruitment process for the next chief executive officer of the HSE as the contract of the current CEO, Professor Brendan Drumm, expires in August this year.  In accordance with section 17 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE board is responsible for making the appointment.  The Act stipulates that the recruitment process must be in accordance with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.</P>
        <P>I understand the recruitment process is being conducted in accordance with the code of practice issued by the Commission for Public Service Appointments.  Public advertisements for the position were placed nationally and internationally in December 2009.  In addition, an executive search and recruitment company, Amrop Strategis, was engaged by the board following competitive tender and conducted an international search for the position.</P>
        <P>By its nature, much of the information about this competitive process, including information about applicants and interviews, is confidential.  It is not appropriate, therefore, for me to speak about the details sought by the Deputy.  However, I understand the intention of the board is to complete the process in June.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is disappointing that Deputies are unable to obtain the information sought as to the number of candidates for the position and how many are external and internal candidates.  Does the Minister have a role in the process of recruiting a new chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive?  What will be the salary of the new CEO?  We have been given to understand it will be in the region of &euro;228,000, which is considerably less than the salary of Professor Drumm.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to a consultancy firm that is involved in the recruitment process.  What has been the cost to the State of this firm&rsquo;s role?  The Minister also indicated she hoped an appointment would be made in June.  I refer her to comments made by Professor Halligan when he declined the job.  He described the health service as &ldquo;over-managed and under-led&rdquo;, adding &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need &euro;17 billion. You absolutely don&rsquo;t . . . you need leadership,&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, under the Health Act 2004, I do not have any role in recruitment.  The search company engaged interviewed or met more than 25 persons from around the world and more than 100 people expressed an interest of some form in the position.  A cap of &euro;37,000 was imposed on the costs of the recruitment process for the company in question and I understand the final figure will be lower than that.  The matter is one for the board of the HSE.  Its chairman informed me last week that it was intended to have identified a successful candidate in June.  The salary is, as recommended, in line with the salary of the Secretaries General to the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance.  By international standards, this is not considered a high salary in this area of responsibility. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister expressed a view to the HSE as to who she believes would be good for the job?  She indicated her view that Professor Tom Keane would be a good candidate for the position.  We all probably regret that he did not take the job.  I am not trying <Col N="233"/>to be vexatious and I put my questions in a positive rather than negative manner.  Given that the Minister has experience of many other health systems from visits she has made to other countries, during which I am sure she has met Irish people working in the health services of various countries, has she suggested the names of any individuals who would be good for the job of chief executive officer of the HSE?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I hold Professor Tom Keane in high regard.  He impressed me so much when I met him in Canada that I asked him would he consider coming to Ireland.  I did not expect to receive a positive response and I was delighted when he decided to come here.  He was appointed to a specific position of overseeing the implementation of the cancer control programme on a contract we agreed with his then employer, the cancer agency of British Columbia.  I have not expressed a preference, although I stated when asked in Cork about Professor Keane&rsquo;s decision to leave the country that I would love him to stay in the country.  I indicated quickly, however, that the CEO of the HSE was not a matter for me but an entirely independent process.  That remains the position and I have not expressed a view to the chairman or any member of the board, nor have I been asked for a view on the matter. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, do not wish to be vexatious in raising an option the Minister may not have considered.  Pending a complete reform of the structures of health care delivery, would the Minister consider suspending the appointment and giving collective responsibility to the next tier of respective heads and leaders of the various sections of the Health Service Executive and direct the funding to the employment of 14 student nurses who would probably make a much more useful contribution at the front line, given that we are exporting them day and daily?  As the people the Minister welcomed to the Gallery were able to share with us, we are training them in order that they can employ them overseas. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know of any health provider which can operate without a CEO.  To refer to the words cited by Deputy Reilly, every organisation needs leadership.  The HSE requires, in particular, a chief executive officer given that it is responsible for a budget of almost &euro;15 billion provided by taxpayers.  I would not consider asking anyone to suspend the recruitment process.  It is important that we have a smooth hand-over from Professor Drumm to his successor.  If the person is identified in June, this will, I hope, take place in August. </P>

        <Quest>  if she will introduce legislation to underpin the provision of services and supports of persons who were injured by thalidomide; if she will engage with the Irish Thalidomide Association in view of the lack of consultation in advance of the settlement offered to them; if an apology on behalf of the State will be offered to those so injured; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[20218/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware that the Minister has met with the Irish Thalidomide Association on a number of occasions since 2008.  At the Minister&rsquo;s request, the State Claims Agency assessed the association&rsquo;s requests in the context of Irish and international provisions for survivors of thalidomide and in the context of Irish case law and precedent.  The State Claims Agency also considered the submissions of the Irish Thalidomide Association and the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society and met both organisations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following consideration of the agency&rsquo;s report, the Minister announced, on 27 April last, the Government&rsquo;s decision to provide additional service and financial supports for Irish survivors of thalidomide.  The measures announced include: provision for special care packages for thalidomide survivors living in Ireland, following multi-disciplinary assessments by an independent <Col N="234"/>expert to be appointed by the Minister; the designation of a senior manager in the HSE to act as a liaison with regard to the ongoing health and personal social services needs of the Irish survivors; a once-off <i>ex gratia</i> payment of &euro;2 million to be divided equally between the Irish survivors as a practical expression of the Government&rsquo;s sympathy; the payment of an annual lump sum, in addition to current payments, equivalent to a further German annual payment which commenced in 2009, of up to &euro;3,680, for survivors in the most severe category; provision whereby, if an individual thalidomide survivor has applied for but does not qualify for either the disabled drivers tax concession scheme or the motorised transport grant, their cases will be examined with a view to providing an equivalent level of financial assistance to assist with their transport needs.  This is a reasonable and compassionate response, aimed at meeting the medical and other needs of survivors.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>Additional information not provided on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister met groups representing survivors of thalidomide and briefed them on the Government&rsquo;s decision. Issues were raised by legal representatives on behalf of both organisations at those meetings, including the manner in which services and supports will be provided, the question of an apology to survivors and certain legal issues.  The Minister has already put in train arrangements for individual assessments of survivors, including the appointment of the independent expert, Dr. Paul O&rsquo;Connell, consultant rheumatologist, and separate liaison arrangements through Ms Carmel Buckley, a senior HSE nursing official.  In regard to the legal issues raised, the Minister informed the survivors that she would have these matters considered urgently, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  The Minister will proceed on the basis of advice from the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>The Minister also wishes to point out that in 1975, the Government of the day also acted on the then Attorney General&rsquo;s advice and expressed a commitment to ensure that the needs of the surviving children would be met.  I know that the Minister joins me in saying that the State has great sympathy for the survivors and it is most regrettable that they should have been put through so much pain and suffering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Minister of State knows that this offer has been unanimously rejected by the Irish Thalidomide Association.  What is his response to that rejection?  I went to the association&rsquo;s press conference last week and the offer was rejected because its members felt that there was no real consultation.  They were brought in at the very end of the process with the State Claims Agency.  Will the Government consider going back to the drawing board and genuinely negotiating a settlement proposal with the two bodies concerned?  The Irish Thalidomide Association represents the vast majority of survivors.</P>
        <P>Will the State apologise to the survivors?  I realise the State did not produce the drug, but there is a strong feeling among survivors that the State could have protected them better and they would like an apology.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have thought that the independent assessment by the State Claims Agency was far from an attempt to exclude submissions by the thalidomide group.  The assessment was carried out independently and this was the response.  I hope the thalidomide group see that it was not an attempt not to listen to them or to delay their involvement.</P>
        <P>The second issue will be considered after the response of the thalidomide groups.  It also ties into the third question.  I do not want to delay things by talking about the level of funding proposed, but this was an expression of sympathy on behalf of the Government, recognising the huge difficulties caused by thalidomide.</P>

	<P>Is the Minister of State expressing that now?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not be hung up on words for the sake of them.  The Minister met on many occasions with both groups and tried to work out a sensible and sympathetic response.  Upon the conclusion of what I hope will be successful talks, we will leave it open to the Government to express sympathy.  I do not think I can offer an apology for something that could cause great concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have listened to what the Minister of State has had to say, I believe he and the Minister should consider an apology because it would go a long way towards appeasing people who have been wronged.  The State may not have made the drug, but agents and servants of the State administered it, and it was available in this country for a longer time than in other countries.  Therefore, the State has a culpability in this area.</P>
        <P>The State Claims Agency operates the clinical indemnity scheme.  While it does great work, it can be quite adversarial in its nature.  Would the Minister of State consider the Injuries Board as a body to assess the thalidomide claim?  It might create a better atmosphere and bring about a different outcome.  Victims of thalidomide are upset because the consultation process was merely a listening exercise rather than a hearing exercise.  They were not heard.</P>

	<P>Finola Cassidy of the Irish Thalidomide Association has described the offer as derisory.  There are only 32 surviving victims, and Ms Cassidy said they feel shell shocked and deeply disappointed.  They are all in their late 40s or early 50s.  We are talking about &euro;60 per week in respect of the annual payment.  It is abysmally low, as is the lump sum of &euro;60,000.  Whoever was responsible for making this assessment clearly has little understanding or regard for the challenges that these people have faced and will continue to face for the rest of their lives.  We should be able to provide more generously and offer language that reflects our collective national sorrow at what has happened.  Is it in the Government&rsquo;s gift to revisit the proposals in this instance?  They need to be dramatically improved.</P>

        <P>I would like to make a point to Deputy Reilly.  I was present for most of the talks between the Minister for Health and Children and the thalidomide groups and &ldquo;adversarial&rdquo; is not the word to describe them.  It has never been the Government&rsquo;s intention to argue down to the very last detail with the thalidomide groups, and we are still open for ongoing talks, but the offer is there and I have to say it is a generous one.</P></Speaker>

	<P>I know that the T&aacute;naiste is standing in for the Taoiseach, who is in Madrid today.</P>
        <P>The Pfizer company announced the loss of 785 jobs this afternoon in a number of locations throughout the country, 300 of which are in Cork, 275 in Newbridge and 210 in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  This is devastating news for the workers and families involved.  While the job losses are not being introduced immediately, it is a matter of the most serious concern for those workers and for other corporations with investments in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In his address to the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland last November, the thenpresident Dr. Paul Duffy, who is also vice-president of operations for Pfizer Ireland, highlighted the challenges facing the multinational sector in this country.  On 1 May 2010, he stated that Ireland should adopt a single issue of protecting jobs in the country.  This was a major flagging issue by a big investor in Ireland.  Last November, Dr. Duffy said that we needed to face up to the repositioning of Ireland as a country to be fit for purpose under the new global reality.  He called for measures to be put in the budget which would retain jobs, encourage competitiveness and innovation, and which would prepare the foundations for new investment and newjobs.</P><Col N="237"/>
       <P>The T&aacute;naiste was the Minister for Enterprise and Employment at that stage.  She would have had contact with Dr. Duffy in his role as the vice-president of operations for Pfizer Ireland.  Given that the Government set aside &euro;36 million in the December budget for a PRSI holiday for employers taking on new employees who had been six months or more on the dole, why has that scheme, which was referred to by Dr. Duffy, not been implemented?  He specifically made the point that in view of the costs and charges that apply to multinationals in Ireland they should be allowed to offset research and development tax credit against other corporate or payroll taxes.  He specifically asked for that in the presence of the Minister for Finance who was the guest of honour at that dinner.  This proposal was supported by the Commission on Taxation and by the Fine Gael Party.  Why was that not included in the budget given that a very major player in our country was sending out a signal about global repositioning that would affect not just Pfizer and Wyeth, but also every other multinational with particular reference to American companies here?  Why were these two measures that Dr. Duffy as vice president of this company called for not dealt with in the budget?  Why has the PRSI holiday not been implemented yet?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The announcement made by Pfizer and the implications this has on an individual are very difficult.  I empathise with that.  The issue has arisen as a consequence of the purchase of Wyeth by Pfizer and the present overcapacity.  This afternoon Pfizer indicated to the stock exchange that 6,000 jobs would go from Pfizer global manufacturing on the basis of that overcapacity.  Arising from that decision, more than 780 jobs will be lost as a consequence.  There is a timeframe in which we can work towards supporting those people.  IDA Ireland is of the view that the three facilities can be sold.  Equally it is important to say that we will continue to have in excess of 4,000 people working within Pfizer.</P>
        <P>I know Dr. Duffy and have met him.  I have listened and continue to listen to what people have to say about foreign direct investment being established and continuing to be established here.  It is important to put on the record the role of IDA Ireland, which has been in a position to establish a number of foreign direct investments last year and this year despite the challenges within the economy.  One of the issues that is very important to FDI in this country is that we constantly reassure &mdash; as the Minister for Finance did in the last budget &mdash; that we will continue to have a 12.5% corporation tax rate.  The Deputy and his party did harm in this regard last week.  Investment in research and development has been enormous and will continue to be on the basis of the development of the smart economy and the innovation island.</P>
        <P>The Deputy raised the specific issue of the PRSI holiday.  As he knows, we are awaiting that discussion here in the House under the social welfare Bill.  That entitlement will be backdated to the beginning of the year.  A number of very important issues have been raised by the FDI community and IDA Ireland in the context of last year&rsquo;s budget, when a number of research and development tax credits were proposed.  Some have been included in the taxation package which has been accepted by the FDI community as greatly beneficial in its sustainability and stabilisation here.  We are not in a position to provide a tax credit to offset something where no profit is created.  In the context of stabilising the FDI community we also included them in two initiatives that were both available to Enterprise Ireland clients, city and county development board clients, and FDI clients.</P>
        <P>We are very cognisant of the role of FDI.  Horizon 2020, the new framework set down by IDA Ireland in the context of sustaining and encouraging new foreign direct investment here is a plan that can be implemented and will see not just the sustainability of a number of existing clients, but also the attraction of new clients to this country.  That does not take away from the issues that have arisen for those working for Pfizer at present.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of matters arise from the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reply.  Dr. Duffy is not an ordinary worker, but is the vice-president of operations for Pfizer Ireland.  His contribution on 26 November was very timely.  He was speaking about Ireland preparing itself to be repositioned and be fit for purpose, as he described it, in a global sense.  Clearly the flare was going up that repositioning was under way by this company and others.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to excess capacity.  Is she aware of other vulnerable corporations here owing to that excess capacity and if so is anybody in Government talking to the chief executives of those companies to deal with the issues to which Dr. Duffy referred, which are competitiveness, investment in innovation, and the allowance for the capacity in research and development?  The T&aacute;naiste said that research and development is a major issue &mdash; and so it is.  He specifically referred to the capacity to allow research and development to be offset against corporate or other taxes.  The T&aacute;naiste did not answer that question.  Given that the Commission on Taxation recommended this and it was supported by my party, why did the Government not consider that that allowance be extended beyond mere profits?  If we want to be fit for purpose for international investment in the country, surely the Government should be really focused on research and development, and innovation, which will be key to the next ten years.  In the words of Dr. Duffy it should be focused on the single issue of retaining jobs.  Following the request of the vice-president of operations of Pfizer Ireland and the president of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, why did the Government not listen to that encouragement for the Government to respond given that it claims to be responsive?</P>
        <P>In his contribution Dr. Duffy also stated that Ireland&rsquo;s energy costs were considerably higher than those of the rest of the European Union.  On numerous occasions Deputy Coveney has pointed out the extent of the liability we have as an exceptionally high cost country in the area of energy.  He made the point that the Government should speak to the National Competitiveness Council before implementing its carbon strategy, which has given rise to excessive costs in energy here.  Did the Government speak to the National Competitiveness Council in that regard?</P>
        <P>Given that the Fine Gael Party has made a series of recommendations to reduce costs and make the country more competitive, has the Government considered the reduction of Government-regulated prices, including those for telecoms and energy?  If so what message does it send to American companies in particular, which are exceptionally agitated and concerned about the rising cost of doing business here?  This is an issue of serious concern across the country.  Is it the intention of the Government to speak to the chief executives of the American corporations that have invested here to follow through and demonstrate that the plea made by the president of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland last November would be implemented by Government and that we should focus on the issue of retention of jobs and not have announcements like the loss of 275 jobs in Newbridge, 210 in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and 300 in Cork, where the T&aacute;naiste advises me there is an overcapacity in this sector?  Will the Government call in those chief executives, listen to them and follow through with Government action to reinforce that call, which was not made lightly, that we reposition ourselves against a global reality of repositioning by these multinational companies?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>First, it is important to say that the decision made by Pfizer has nothing to do with the Irish economy.  It has to do with the fact that Pfizer has purchased Wyeth and there is global over-capacity.  That is the reason.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Second, Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, taoisigh, t&aacute;naist&iacute; and all Members of the Cabinet engage fully with our foreign direct investment, FDI, clients.

The Deputy is acutely aware of that.  That is a constant conversation, dialogue and support mechanism between the relevant Minister, the line Minister and Ministers of State and the IDA.

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to stay on the same topic but to focus on the plight, in particular, of the 785 people who have been told this evening they are to lose their jobs at <Col N="241"/>locations in Cork, Kildare and D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and on the worries of suppliers to Pfizer and those contracted to it.  There are probably another 1,500 to 2,000 jobs in the wider economy that will be at risk as a result of this decision.  </P>
        <P>When did the Government become aware these jobs were to go?  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell us what the Government did to try to save these jobs?  She said the reason the jobs are being lost is because of the purchase between Pfizer and Wyeth.  What meetings took place between Ministers and Pfizer following that purchase?  What discussions took place between the State agencies and Pfizer-Wyeth?  When did the Government become aware there might be jobs at risk in this country as a result of that purchase?  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline for the House what steps were taken by Government to try to save the jobs?</P>
        <P>Do I understand from the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reply to Deputy Kenny the Government is now throwing in the towel on these jobs or will any action be taken, even at this late stage, to try to retrieve at least some of them?  What plans does any Minister &mdash; or the Government &mdash;  have to have discussions with Pfizer about this decision in order to see if something can be done to try to rescue at least part of the employment?</P>
        <P>What did the T&aacute;naiste mean when she said the plants can be sold?  What does that mean in employment terms?  To whom can they be sold?  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware of a potential purchaser?  What are the implications of that for the people who are worried this evening that they will lose their jobs?</P>

	<P Just="Left">The IDA has had a working relationship with Wyeth and Pfizer and their presence in this country has been substantial.  The IDA will continue to work with those two companies.  At the time a takeover bid took place and during that takeover bid I happened to be in the United States, where I had the opportunity of being facilitated by a meeting with the chief executive officer of Pfizer.  Naturally, this was during the period of the takeover and the chief executive was precluded from making any pronouncements on the matter.  However, I articulated, as did the chief executive of the IDA who was with me, that we wanted, first, to work with the new company, Pfizer.  Second, we wanted to articulate the sustainability of the maximum number of positions in this country.  Third, we said we would work with the Pfizer team when they were appointed.  Therefore, the Deputy can appreciate the chief executive was not in a position to make a final pronouncement on that matter but we articulated our concerns and he agreed he would follow through with the relevant personnel once they were appointed and the final takeover was accepted and finalised.</P>
        <P>I know from my workings with the IDA there was a constant dialogue between the IDA executives at chief executive and director level with the relevant personnel during visits that took place when Pfizer came to Ireland to appreciate the decisions that were finalised by the company in the takeover of Wyeth.  It is important to say that that conversation and dialogue will continue.</P>
        <P>It is important to say that the IDA has advised that concerning the three plants which are modern and have had huge investment it is very confident that a buyer can be found for the facilities and it will work very closely with Pfizer in that regard.</P>
        <P>I cannot say when the present Minister met the company as I did not have an opportunity to ask him that but I am aware that constant dialogue has been taking place.  The assurances given by the IDA are forthright and it will work vehemently to ensure that we sustain as many jobs as possible.  A timeframe is set down which will allow State agencies to interact with the individual people to support them either with the provision of a skill or in the facilitation of other opportunities.  It is important to say there was a considerable amount of interaction and work done by the IDA on behalf of the State in the context of the Pfizer takeover and on the <Col N="242"/>basis that there was a global capacity problem.  We articulated that we had invested significantly in supporting the presence of Pfizer and Wyeth in this country and wanted it to continue.  The IDA is hopeful that following from the final decisions made by Pfizer today, it will continue to work with Pfizer for further future developments and investments by the company in Ireland.  We were advised at the time that approximately 6,000 jobs from a company total of 33,000 would have been at risk as a consequence of the announcement of the takeover of Wyeth by Pfizer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I take it from the reply that the T&aacute;naiste was aware at the time of the Pfizer takeover of Wyeth that there was a risk to jobs in Ireland.  She said the chief executive of Pfizer promised to follow through on this but I would like to know the follow-through undertaken by the T&aacute;naiste.  Following her conversation with the chief executive of Pfizer around the time of the purchase, did she have any further meetings with representatives of Pfizer?  What steps did the Government take at the time, when it was clearly aware that there was a risk to these jobs?  What actions were taken by the Government to try to save the jobs?</P>
        <P>I appreciate the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s comments that there was ongoing dialogue between the IDA, Pfizer and other companies.  What initiatives and actions were taken by the Government and when did it specifically become aware that these 785 jobs would go today in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Cork and Kildare?  The T&aacute;naiste did not answer my question about whether she accepts that the jobs are gone.  Has the Government given up on these 785 jobs or is there any prospect of hope for the people who have those jobs for the employment to be saved?</P>
        <P>It is clear from the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reply that the Government was aware at the time of the Pfizer purchase of Wyeth that employment was at risk.  We need to know what steps were taken by the Government to protect Irish workers&rsquo; interests and jobs in the plants.  Other than the general conversations described to us by the T&aacute;naiste, it is not clear that any specific action was taken by the Government to try to save the jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Anybody who has read about or familiarised themselves with what is happening in the drug and biopharmaceutical industry would be acutely aware that many drugs were going off patent and research and development investment was difficult for many large corporations.  It was quite obvious that when Pfizer purchased Wyeth there would be a global overcapacity.  That was public knowledge and I recall reading about it in the <i>Financial Times</i> while these discussions were taking place based on the sustainability of a number of wonder drugs that would soon go off patent.</P>
        <P>That information was circulating and officials, particularly the chief executive of the IDA and those in the United States who service those clients, would have worked very closely with Pfizer and Wyeth for a considerable number of years.  I took the opportunity, prior to the finalisation of the Pfizer takeover, to speak to the chief executive of the company.  It was important to address a number of concerns we had in Ireland on how to sustain the maximum number of employees here, while we knew a decision on global numbers would be made at some stage.  No definite timeframe was given.  Following the takeover by Pfizer, a team was put together by the company and I recall meeting some of the team when they came to Ireland to see the Wyeth and Pfizer facilities.</P>
        <P>The board decision was made by Pfizer at the end of the day.  As I indicated, the IDA advised that 6,000 positions were to be lost from 33,000 at risk and warned of the impact this would have on Ireland.  Despite the reorganisation of the company, Pfizer will continue to be a significant strategic employer in Ireland, with more than 4,000 people working in the company.</P><Col N="243"/>
        <P>On the specific issue of the steps taken to save those jobs, during the takeover discussions and since, the IDA, the Minister and officials from the Department have been engaging in discussions and supports for the overall presence of Pfizer in this country.  We will continue to engage and support the company in this country.  In the context of the sale of the three facilities, the IDA is of the view that in working closely with Pfizer it is confident of finding a buyer over the period, which is 2012 to 2014.  We will continue to support those people working in Pfizer and we will work with the company to alleviate the impact of the global decision coming as a consequence of overcapacity in the industry because of so many drugs coming off patent and the investment needs of the companies in research and development.</P>
        <P>We will continue to work for the constituents of the Deputy and all the people affected by this global decision.  The IDA and other support services will look to support them.</P>

The decision was taken by the HSE purely on financial grounds, with little regard for the elderly, in a move that is akin to eviction and will be mirrored throughout the country in the months ahead.</P>

Is she planning to consult the Medical Council and other health authorities to avert this pending health care nightmare for people in the north east and Dundalk in particular?  Will she clarify urgently what steps she is proposing to take in this regard?  It is important that she is aware that the Government cannot continue trying to pass the buck to the HSE and claiming something that will deal a death knell to the area of the Ceann Comhairle and me is not her policy.

The T&aacute;naiste stated that there was a continuous dialogue with our foreign direct investment, FDI, investors, a continuous listening process by the Government and a continuous stream of meetings.  Last November, Dr. Duffy pointed out his concerns, some of which were not heeded.</P>
        <P>In the programme for Government, the Government committed to reviewing the appropriateness of road standards and to making a continuous investment in the major roads system. <Col N="245"/> Given that Pfizer&rsquo;s operations in Ireland have announced 785 job losses, Allergan Pharmaceuticals and Baxter Healthcare have publicly on the national airwaves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>They are serious investors in this country and each employs more than 1,000 people.  They have expressed their concerns about the appropriateness and standard of the road system and the cost to them of extra packaging to get their products safely to their international markets.  In the context of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s comments, is she prepared to enter into dialogue with the chief executives of these major companies to deal with the concerns they have flagged?  She should listen to and act on this issue.</P>
        <P>Daniel McAnaspie was murdered.  It is a most unfortunate and tragic case.  Deputy Shatter raised the matter a number of times and it will be raised on the Adjournment this evening.  As he has pointed out, there is a need for an independent inquiry into this tragic case.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Yes.  I will not pursue it any further, but I will say something.  Daniel McAnaspie&rsquo;s young body was found in tragic circumstances.  Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify whether there will be a children&rsquo;s rights referendum in 2010?  The Minister of State with responsibility for children is sitting behind her.  He has been allocated &euro;3 million for the holding of a referendum.  The all-party committee has done its work and recommended a wording and no secret process is being conducted by the Minister of State.  We are entitled to be told whether the Government intends to hold a children&rsquo;s referendum in 2010.  In light of this latest tragic incident, the Government should at least be able to say it intends to hold a children&rsquo;s referendum in the 2010 calendar year.  This would give the Minister of State and the Government plenty of scope to deal with the process, the report of the all-party committee, the agreed wording of the referendum and the requisite Bill.  Will the T&aacute;naiste tell the House whether there will be a children&rsquo;s rights referendum in 2010 or are we to continue this dialogue interminably with no answers coming from the Government?</P>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste, in reply to Deputy Kenny, stated that the issue of the holding of a referendum on the rights of children is the subject of Private Members&rsquo; business tonight.  I am looking at the Government&rsquo;s proposed amendment to the motion that will be proposed by Deputies Howlin and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  That amendment asks the House to commend &ldquo;the Government for prioritising the promotion and protection of the welfare and rights of children&rdquo;.  This is an unfortunate clause, given that the amendment opposes the holding of the referendum in 2010.  The motion before the House calls for the referendum to be held in 2010 and for the Government to introduce the necessary legislation.  It is doubly unfortunate and insensitive to have an amendment of this kind put on the Order Paper immediately after the discovery of the body of the late Daniel McAnaspie, who died in tragic and unfortunate circumstances.  It is particularly insensitive, given that we have been told the inquiry into his death will apparently be conducted by a panel of experts that has not yet been established.</P>
        <P>The issue of a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights was agreed by the all-party committee.  Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke made her report to the House and it was agreed across parties that this issue should not become the subject of partisan debate.  If the Government will agree to hold the referendum in 2010, we will agree on the motion.  All we want is a commitment from the Government to hold the referendum in 2010.  There is no reason for the Government not to agree other than its political reasons, namely, if there is to be a referendum on children in 2010, the Government is afraid that it will not be able to avoid holding the outstanding by-elections in 2010.</P>
      
        <P>All we need, rather than this self-congratulatory and insensitive proposal from Government commending itself on prioritising the promotion and protection of the welfare and rights of children, is an agreement and commitment from the Government that the referendum will be held in 2010.  We can then agree the motion before the House tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue is far too serious for the political castigations sent across the floor of the House.  In my view &mdash; this is a personal view &mdash; any referendum on children&rsquo;s rights should be, given its importance, held on its own.</P>

A huge amount of work has been done by the all-party committee.  I have stated publicly that the Government congratulates it on its work.  A number of Departments under the auspices of the Minister of State are working on this matter.  In the meantime, it is important to say that despite the economic difficulties and challenges facing us, we have provided the Minister of State, through his Department&rsquo;s budget, with an additional &euro;15 million for the employment of approximately 200 additional social workers in 2010, recruitment of whom is under way.</P>

	<P>That recruitment is currently taking place.  Finance to allow this to happen has been provided to the Minister of State.

There is clearly an acceptance that the Government will hold a referendum.  The issue yet to be decided is the timeframe and date in this regard.

All we want from Government is a commitment that the referendum will be held in 2010.  If the T&aacute;naiste can give us that commitment, we will agree the motion.  The question is simple enough.  I do not understand the reason that commitment cannot be given.  There is agreement in the House and, I believe, within the wider community that this is an important issue and that we need to proceed with it.  As it happens, this issue is once again up for public debate in regard to the tragic death of Daniel McAnaspie.  All we are looking for is a commitment from Government that the referendum will be held in 2010.  If this commitment is given, we can agree the motion and move on.</P>

	<P>The amendment tabled by Government to the Labour Party-Sinn F&eacute;in motion before the House this evening is, as has already been described, self-congratulatory.  It also appears to seek to exclude the input of all of the Opposition parties.  The section not quoted by the previous speaker states: &ldquo;recognises the work of the Government contained in the first and second interim reports of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children&rdquo;, which committee was an all-party committee.  We all had our respective inputs into the first and second reports, which reports are not so interim in that they required specific actions on the part of Government.  We are still awaiting publication of the legislation to give effect to the first report in regard to reporting and soft information.  This is not a congratulatory matter for Government by any yardstick whatsoever; it is regrettable. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe the Government has failed to grasp the sense of public outcry and anger in terms of the focus of the State&rsquo;s neglect of children which in recent times was historic <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i> the <Col N="248"/>religious institutions.  It has now dawned on a growing number of people that the threat to children is not historic but is real and contemporary and will continue into the future.  We must ensure that every protection possible is brought into effect to protect children into the future.  This requires legislation, including the referendum Bill and the successful passage of a referendum along the lines of the wording already recommended by the all-party committee.  We have already indicated that we will collectively work to ensure the successful passage of such an amendment if the Government would only indicate acceptance and a willingness to proceed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given a response on the referendum issue to the Leaders of the Opposition.  The national vetting bureau Bill is at an advanced stage.  Work on the heads of that Bill has commenced.  Substantial work has also been done on the criminal law (sexual offences) Bill.  There is a difference between the considerations of an Oireachtas committee and those of all the relevant Departments.  Clearly, the focus is on the Government appreciating the necessity for a referendum and we are working towards that.</P>

	<P>The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that the Director of Public Prosecutions has stated that, in his opinion, prosecuting white-collar crime will be difficult, if not impossible, without legislation to protect whistleblowers.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Have we legislation in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 2006, Government policy on whistleblowing has been to address this matter on a sectoral basis and this is taking place.</P>

	<P>It is not a question of one size fitting all.  I can recall introducing it in legislation, as have many of my colleagues.  The Deputy is aware this is how the issue of whistleblowing is being dealt with within each item of legislation that comes before the House.  There is no proposal for overarching legislation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Thus far, 12 items of legislation have dealt with the issue of whistleblowing.  They have been introduced in areas such as justice, consumer affairs, employment, NAMA and so on.  The point is that the issue will be dealt with on a sectoral basis as the need arises within each sector.</P>

	<P>Members are interested in neither consumer affairs nor the list just provided to the T&aacute;naiste by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  They are interested in catching white-collar criminals who have taken everyone for a ride and who have threatened our country with economic ruin.  The man whose job it is to prosecute them has stated that he needs legislation to protect whistleblowers.  Measures being taken with regard to consumer affairs and elsewhere are irrelevant.  What is needed is an item of legislation, such as that published by the Labour Party.</P>

	<P>The Ceann Comhairle and the entire country is aware that it is before the Seanad.  However, no one but the T&aacute;naiste knows whether it will come before this House.  I seek clarification in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Bill before Members today will enable Ireland to play its part along with all other euro area countries in providing financial support to Greece.  Our assistance, in the form of repayable loans, will be channelled centrally through the European Commission as part of an agreed euro area package, together with the International Monetary Fund.  It is important to emphasise that this assistance comes with strong conditionality attached.  This multilateral loan facility rep<Col N="254"/>resents just part of a series of decisive measures designed to restore financial market confidence and to project a resolute signal that governments will take all the necessary measures to protect the integrity of both the euro area economy and the euro currency.  This support is designed to safeguard the fundamental financial stability of the single currency area.  Only in this context can our economic recovery be secured.  In common with the position in other euro area member states, people in Ireland can be relied upon and indeed have a vested interest in showing solidarity with our partners in these challenging times.</P>
        <P>The reason this debate is taking place today is because, in essence, our Greek partners can no longer borrow at sustainable rates on the international bond markets. The authorities there have requested support from other euro area member states and the IMF.  As the financial position of Greece deteriorated in recent months, the heads of state and Governments of the euro area reaffirmed their willingness to take determined and co-ordinated action, if needed, to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole.  On foot of these commitments the euro area Finance Ministers agreed on 11 April the terms of financial support to be given to Greece.  This was to be implemented through bilateral loans centrally pooled by the European Commission as part of an agreed euro area package, with co-financing from the IMF.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 14 April the Government approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Greek financial support programme and agreed to the preparation of the necessary legislation to permit the provision of assistance.  On 23 April 2010, Greece formally applied for the activation of the euro area support mechanism.  At our subsequent meeting on 2 May 2010, eurogroup Ministers concurred with the European Commission and the ECB&rsquo;s assessment that Greece&rsquo;s ability to access funding on bond markets was insufficient and that a loan was needed to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area.  The eurogroup Ministers unanimously agreed to activate stability support to Greece through bilateral loans to be centrally pooled by the European Commission.  This will comprise an overall aid package of &euro;110 billion over a three-year period, of which &euro;30 billion will be funded by the IMF.  This financial support will effectively mean Greece will not need to rely upon the sovereign debt markets for its funding needs for a period of time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 7 May the Taoiseach attended a meeting of the Heads of State and Governments of the euro area which endorsed the loan facility for Greece.  The Taoiseach confirmed, subject to enactment of our legislation, Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this joint loan facility.  Also, on the same day, I signed the intercreditor agreement which will govern our contribution to the euro area response.  All these steps are, of course, subject to the enactment of our domestic legislation.</P>
        <P>On 8 May, the European Commission signed, on behalf of euro area member states, the loan facility agreement &mdash; to which I will return later &mdash; which sets out the key terms and conditions of the agreement with Greece.  While the first disbursement under this facility was released today, Ireland will contribute to later tranches once all of our national procedures are completed.  Today is an important step in this regard.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of the year, the Greek Government has shown its determination to address its fiscal challenges.  The Greek Prime Minister has reiterated the total commitment of his Government to the full implementation of these vital reforms.  As part of the proposed support package and loan agreements, Greece has entered into stringent commitments to undertake fiscal consolidation measures, implement structural reforms and apply financial stability measures.  The main pillar of the Greek authorities programme will be public expenditure adjustments with the aim of reducing the deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2014.  In nominal terms this represents public spending cuts of &euro;30 billion over this period.  Furthermore, to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio, Greece will have to maintain a primary surplus on their budget of at least 5% for the next decade.</P><Col N="255"/>
        <P>To assess progress towards achieving these commitments and as a condition of further loan disbursements, Greece will be the subject of continuous appraisal by the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB.  Make no mistake, there are no easy outcomes when it comes to restoring sustainability to the public finances, either here or elsewhere.</P>
        <P>What are the financial implications of this Bill for Ireland?  Our financial support package is in the form of loans which will be repaid as the economic position in Greece improves.  Central to the overall support package is the commitment that member states&rsquo; funding costs are to be met in full.  In other words, we will not be financially disadvantaged by these arrangements.  Furthermore, while our debt level will rise as a result of this additional borrowing, the financial assistance we provide will not impact upon our general government deficit, as it is classified as a financial transaction.  A further safeguard underpinning the entire process is that if any euro area member state should encounter higher funding costs than those charged to Greece, there are provisions for these additional funding costs to be recouped.  In present circumstances that is most unlikely for Ireland.  The NTMA had a successful bond issue this morning of &euro;1.5 billion and it was oversubscribed more than three times.</P>
        <P>EU Commissioner Rehn has provided a further reassurance on these important elements of the financial support programme.  He has confirmed that there will be no loss to eurozone taxpayers arising from the provision of these loans.  In addition, from a budgetary perspective, these arrangements will be taken into account by the Commission in its fiscal surveillance procedures.</P>
        <P>Based on the euro area contribution of &euro;80 billion, Ireland&rsquo;s share, which is based on the ECB paid capital, will be just less than 1.64%.  Payments will be made on a phased basis and, as such, there is a likelihood that there might be some &ldquo;frontloading&rdquo; of our overall contribution.  That said, our overall contribution is anticipated to be about &euro;1.3 billion.  To allow scope for internal rebalancing within the loan facility, the text of the Bill provides for a precautionary upper limit of up to &euro;1.5 billion.</P>
        <P>The overall financial support agreement allows for a loan facility to Greece for the next three years while the component loans cannot exceed a term of five years.  When all the funds have been paid back to the participating member states, the mechanism will cease to exist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The main proposals contained in the Euro Area Loan Facility Bill are intended to provide for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the euro area loan facility to Greece subject to the terms of the loan documentation; payments to be made from the central fund in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s share of the euro area funding and that such payments be based on our ECB paid capital key of 1.64% and subject to an overall limit of &euro;1.5 billion; the receipt into the Exchequer of interest payments and repayment of principal amounts of the loan funding and any related receipts; and annual reports on expenditure and receipts to Ireland under the loan facility to be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In legislative terms this is a relatively straightforward Bill containing half a dozen sections.  Section 1 provides detail on the definition of the various technical terms contained within the Bill.  Section 2 provides for payments from the central fund subject to the terms of the inter-creditor and loan facility agreements.  These agreements are appended in Schedules 1 and 2.  Section 3 provides for the crediting of the Exchequer with moneys received on behalf of the State in connection with the loan facility.  Section 4 provides for annual reports on payments made and received to be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Sections 5 and 6 cover expenses incurred in the administration of the Act and its short title respectively.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to turn briefly to the agreements and the related memorandum of understanding, which, while not part of this Bill, has been laid before the House.  Schedule 1 is the inter-creditor agreement which I signed on behalf of the State on 7 May.  It provides that the Euro<Col N="256"/>pean Commission will act on behalf of the euro area member states in the management and administration of the pooled bilateral loans for Greece, with the ECB acting as paying agent.  It comes into effect once the European Commission receives a commitment confirmation from a critical mass of at least five member states and two thirds of the total commitment amount.</P>
        <P>Schedule 2 is the loan facility agreement between the euro area member states and Greece which sets out all of the key details relating to the terms and conditions.  The European Commission has been entrusted by the member states to coordinate and manage the pooled bilateral loans to Greece.</P>
        <P>The memorandum of understanding sets out the policy considerations required of Greece.  It has been laid before the Houses.  Briefly, it contains three elements: The memorandum of understanding on specific economic policy conditionality specifies detailed economic policy measures that will serve as benchmarks for assessing policy performance in the context of the quarterly reviews under the assistance programme.  The memorandum of economic and financial policies outlines the economic and financial policies that the Greek Government and the Bank of Greece will implement during the remainder of 2010 and in the period 2011-14 to strengthen market confidence in Greece&rsquo;s fiscal and financial position.  The technical memorandum of understanding sets out the definitions surrounding the performance criteria and various target indicators.  It also describes the methods to be used in assessing programme performance and the various information requirements to ensure adequate monitoring of the targets.  Ongoing compliance by Greece with the terms of the memorandum of understanding will be a prerequisite for the drawdown of the loan facility.</P>
        <P>In the context of a perceived background risk of contagion from Greece to other member states, the Ecofin Ministers decided to establish a comprehensive package of measures including the establishment of a European financial stabilisation mechanism.  This is based on Article 122.2 of the treaty which provides for financial support to member states in difficulties caused by exceptional circumstances.</P>
        <P>Under this mechanism, an initial &euro;60 billion from the overall EU budget can be mobilised very rapidly if required.  Complementing this, it is proposed that euro area member states, including Ireland, will make up an additional &euro;440 billion in loan guarantees through a special purpose vehicle in accordance with our ECB capital participation.  The IMF will also participate in the overall financing arrangements and is expected to provide in the region of up to &euro;250 billion.  Separately, the ECB will make appropriate interventions in the debt securities markets if necessary.  The governance arrangements of this stabilisation mechanism, in particular relating to a possible activation of support, have yet to be determined but they will be similar to those in the Greek case.  It is likely that this mechanism will also require legislation, and in my view it will require legislation.  As I indicated, the ECB can make appropriate interventions in the debt securities markets if necessary, and has made such interventions.  ECOFIN Ministers also reiterated their commitment to ensure fiscal sustainability and enhanced economic growth in all members states.  It was agreed that where warranted, plans for fiscal consolidation and structural reforms will be accelerated across the full eurozone.</P>
        <P>To advance this objective, last week the European Commission brought forward various reform proposals to reinforce economic co-ordination and to ensure that the budgetary policies of member states do not undermine the economic and financial stability of the euro area.  These will form the basis for further discussion by the task force, chaired by EU President Van Rompuy.  I will attend the first meeting of this task force which is scheduled for this Friday.  These proposals mark the beginning of discussions on these issues.  Like most Commission documents, it is designed to float ideas and stimulate debate.  Any policy proposals arising from it will have to be ultimately agreed by the member states.  However, to suggest, as some did <Col N="257"/>last week, that these proposals represent a dilution of our sovereignty over taxation matters is, at best, mischievous.</P>
        <P>The enhanced co-ordination recommended by the Commission is designed to assist the member states to be better prepared for any future crises.  We have all seen over recent weeks how a speculative attack on one member state has reverberations for the economies of all member states in the eurozone.  For that reason, we all have a shared interest in increased co-ordination throughout the zone.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other initiatives decided upon by the Council relate to regulatory and supervisory reform of financial markets, including the derivative markets and looking at the role of ratings agencies.  Work is continuing on other proposals including the possible introduction of a stability fee which will ensure that the financial sector will, in future, pay its share in the event of another financial sector crisis.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss our economic prospects, particularly as we are committed under this Bill to borrow an additional &euro;1.3 billion.  We are well aware of the enormous challenges that a small economy can face during difficult and turbulent economic times.  However, there are welcome indications that we are beginning to turn the corner.  Recent economic data and a range of other indicators show that the economy is stabilising.  Consumer sentiment is strengthening and we see clear evidence of increased activity in the motor trade and retail sales sectors.  Government policy measures in the most recent budget have helped restore confidence.  In addition, industrial production data and other leading business indicators are also showing signs of improvement.  My prediction in December&rsquo;s budget that the economy would bottom-out by mid-year and that positive growth would resume in the second half of this year is being borne out.  Most economic commentators now share my Department&rsquo;s forecast.  In fact, many are more sanguine about our economic prospects.</P>
        <P>A number of key elements underpin the Government&rsquo;s approach to addressing our economic challenges, namely, the restoration of stability to the public finances, the repair of the banking system and regaining our economic competitiveness.  We have demonstrated our resolve to restore sustainability to the public finances.  We have shown our ability to manage our budgetary and economic affairs in a prudent, credible manner.  We will continue to implement our plan to bring the public spending deficit below the 3% required by the GDP stability and growth pact threshold by the end of 2014.</P>
        <P>The most recent set of Exchequer returns covering the period to the end of April were in line with expectations and show that the action taken by the Government in managing the public finances is working.  The &euro;3 billion adjustment for next year&rsquo;s budget will challenge us but we will achieve it because we must, because it is the right thing for our country.  Our focus now is to continue to engender confidence in households, in the domestic business sector and in the international investment community by adhering to our stated plan and showing that we can look after our own affairs.</P>
        <P>Recent developments such as those which gave rise to the Bill before us today highlight the need for us to stick with our plan.  The difficult measures the Government has taken in the past two years have been vindicated.  If we had not taken this tough action we would now be in the unenviable position of having to take even harder measures to stabilise our economy than those now being put in place by Greece.</P>
        <P>I have outlined for the House the background to this Bill.  The action it proposes is based on the principles of solidarity and responsibility which lie at the core of monetary union membership.  The support the euro area members are prepared to give to Greece will be of benefit to us all.  What is at issue here is the financial stability of the euro area and the principle of <Col N="258"/>European solidarity.  I hope we can have an informed and constructive debate on this Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill, and Fine Gael will support it on Second Stage.  Of course we recognise this is of significant cost.  It will cost &euro;1.3 billion, which will raise our public debt by almost 1% of GDP.  There is also an additional &euro;7.2 billion guarantee into which the Minister is entering on behalf of the Irish taxpayer.  The entire package, at &euro;8.5 billion, is of significant proportions.  There is an important element to this debate, which is whether it will work.  This is the most central aspect we must debate.</P>
        <P>In a crisis there is an instinct to adopt a plan and then demand unswerving commitment to it regardless.  Often, the reaction is to brand people who question it as heretics, unpatriotic or populist.  Perhaps that instinct is understandable.  However, to ensure that the EU initiatives succeed there must be robust scrutiny.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s willingness to enter into robust debate on this because it is an important debate; perhaps it is one of the most important debates we will have in the context of the development of the European Union.</P>
        <P>We need to realise the eurozone is in deep crisis because of design flaws when it was first put in place.  Those design flaws were not carefully watched after it was launched and this has developed into a full-blown crisis.  We need to understand what went wrong before we set out a firm and clear solution.  A number of things went wrong, as the eurozone embraced a range of economies which could not have been said to be convergent.  There are clear structural imbalances between some of the economies.  Germany runs huge trade surpluses with very tight control on wages and costs and is very competitive on international markets.  It is rapidly expanding its exports within the eurozone.  Other countries run huge trade deficits and have seen their competitiveness eroded.  Some of these countries made wilful mistakes but a proper eurozone strategy should have sought to address others.  However, the eurozone never had the tools to promote the type of convergence that was needed to confront these structural difficulties.</P>
        <P>The eurozone also lacked stabilisation tools to deal with what economists describe as asymmetrical shocks, which are where crises affect some countries far worse than others.  A stabilisation pool of some type is required to deal with this but the eurozone has not had one.  We are now seeing the emergence of this.</P>
        <P>Besides these very significant design flaws, the biggest missing element was the lack of clear understanding among members states of what was required of them to survive, thrive and prosper in the eurozone and to make their membership a success.  We need look no further than Ireland to see how true this is.  Our economic leaders forgot what it takes to succeed in a small open economy.  This almost coincided to the day we joined the eurozone, perhaps it started a year or two prior to it.  Its symptoms are there for all to see and I will repeat them because people tend to want to air-brush them out of history.</P>
        <P>Gross spending by Government grew at 12% per annum after we joined the eurozone.  This was more than twice as fast as it had grown prior to joining and 50% faster than the rate of growth of the economy.  It was plainly unsustainable.  Export growth collapsed to less than one quarter of the rate that had applied prior to joining the eurozone.  This was an incredible collapse in our export performance and we lost market share consistently for six years in a row, from 2001 onwards.  Unit wage costs grew at five times the rate they did prior to joining the eurozone.  Significantly, this occurred at a time when Germany was decreasing its unit wage costs to zero growth.  In just six years we lost 25% of our competitive edge, relative to Germany.  House prices doubled in the years after we joined the eurozone and rose much faster than anything which had occurred there before.  The exposure of our banks to foreign sources of <Col N="259"/>funding went from 10%, according to the Governor of the Central Bank, to 60%. No one cried, &ldquo;Halt&rdquo;.  None of the regulators&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We were within the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed, but no one cried, &ldquo;Halt&rdquo; to what was clearly an unsustainable policy.  Those who criticised it were treated like pariahs &mdash; it came from the Minister&rsquo;s benches.  They were told they should go and commit suicide and that they were unpatriotic.  They were told the most extraordinary things.  Those were the facts.  Ireland was not alone in this.  Other countries saw the arrival of cheap money as an opportunity to develop unsustainable policies.  The most crucial thing which has to change is that there must be an understanding between the elected Members of the Irish Parliament and, through us, the people of this country about what it takes to survive in a small open economy in a difficult fixed currency regime.</P>
        <P>I worry about some of the direction of the eurozone thinking regarding the rectifying of the problem which does not see domestic understanding of those issues as the core correction which we have to bring about.  At the collective eurozone level there was not an understanding of what was required to make the eurozone work.  The Stability and Growth Pact was clearly unenforceable and nothing was done to correct it.  The bail out clause did not act in the way people thought it would and it is no longer part of the structure.  The growth strategy articulated in Lisbon was simply not carried through and we have the evidence of the Spanish and Swedish Prime Ministers testifying as to the complete failure to implement the growth strategy which was essential to a successful eurozone.  It cannot be built on retrenchment alone.  That is the narrow focus which we are now seeing.</P>
        <P>Member states adopted a go it alone strategy, not only the weak states but also the strong ones.  For example, Germany&rsquo;s approach was a go it alone strategy.  There was no convergence across the economies and no tools were being developed to deliver that.  The European Central Bank chose an extremely narrow target, namely, inflation, when asset price bubbles were building up, in particular in Ireland, and there was no proper response to that.  There are deep issues which need to be confronted that do not just revolve around the PIGS countries getting their public finances under control.  To listen to this debate one would sometimes think that is the focus and the drive of this debate.</P>
        <P>I do not criticise; faced with this crisis the eurozone Ministers and the European Central Bank have been extremely innovative in what they have come up with.  The bilateral aid to Greece, the stabilisation fund which was developed jointly with the IMF, the relaxation of the rules by the European Central Bank and some elements of convergence and the co-ordination of fiscal strategy are extremely welcome.  They are significant measures.  It is hoped this will bolster the eurozone.  There has been some doubt as to how successful that has been to date.  One increasingly hears key architects of that strategy saying that it is now only a breathing space to undertake reforms; they do not see it as a solution in itself.</P>
        <P>There are major missing pieces which are not getting much attention, namely, the continuing lack of a credible European Union growth strategy and supports for structural reforms to create more competitive eurozone economies, in particular in the deficit countries.  That has to be part of making this a long-term viable solution for the eurozone.  Taken at face value, I can understand how markets look at Greece and see a formula which will shrink the economy in the short term by very tough retrenchment, during which time debt will inevitably grow because it is being supported to allow that to happen and the hope is that in three years&rsquo; time it will appear to be stronger.  One will have a higher debt to GNP ratio after three years of this medicine.</P><Col N="260"/>
        <P>I can understand how markets look in at Greece and ask where its capacity to drive a big export market which will make it a viable strategy is &mdash; perhaps they do not see it.  It is not surprising that people will look with a jaundiced view at what is quite a narrow dimensional response to the crisis which has been building.  I acknowledge that Ireland is fortunate to have a much more resilient export sector and that is the key element which distinguishes us.  Greece and Portugal are running deficits of nearly 10%.  Ireland is still running a trade surplus.</P>
        <P>We are fortunate, notwithstanding the discussion which occurred earlier here, to have embedded sectors which give us an edge and resilience to deal with a crisis of this nature which are not available to others.  However, our banking policy, which has essentially involved the transfer of bad loans and failed banks onto the backs of taxpayers, has put us back into the spotlight.  It has doubled our debt at a stroke and I have misgivings, as the Minister knows, about the wisdom of that.  It is not a least cost strategy and it has put us into the spotlight where one would hope we would not be.</P>
        <P>Ireland must also examine whether this process, which has been designed in the eurozone, will work for us.  I do not see a credible growth strategy for Ireland coming from the sort of debate and discussion which is occurring in Europe.  I have said before, and it is not secret to the Minister, that I do not believe the Government has a credible growth strategy.  The approach which I have heard the Taoiseach articulate repeatedly is that we should write whatever cheques are necessary to bail out the banks and correct the fiscal balance &mdash; that is the sum total of the strategy.  That will not work.</P>
        <P>There is a consistent view on the Opposition benches that we simply do not have a credible job strategy and the lack of one is undermining our ability to weather this storm.  The danger is that the narrow view of Ireland&rsquo;s needs will now be copper-fastened by an equally narrow perception of the nature of the problem within Europe.  We will have the double whammy of an excessively narrow view of what is needed.</P>
        <P>Another issue which has to be addressed &mdash; the former Taoiseach is hugely culpable for not having addressed it &mdash; is that we have a budget system which is not fit for the running of a corner shop.  It is a total disgrace.  We do not have any system for independent assessment of whether the fiscal stance being taken by Government is appropriate.  As a result we have seen numerous reckless budgets introduced which poured fuel onto flames, in terms of economic strategy.  Many of those polices were introduced by the former Minister for Finance, who is now the Taoiseach, and his predecessor.  There was no system of checks or balances in the House or system to confront the reckless fiscal strategies which were adopted by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors.</P>
        <P>That is a deep flaw in the way we conduct our budget business.  The Minister has not suggested any reform, nor did his predecessors.  We will not confront the difficulties which we have created domestically by catastrophic policy failures unless we start to change that system.  There is no prior scrutiny by Parliament of any of the choices being made in the budget.  It galls me to see the Taoiseach trot out and pretend there was proper scrutiny of property tax reliefs.  This was an opaque box which would not be opened and Governments and former Ministers, including Charlie McCreevy and the Taoiseach, insisted on keeping them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Time and again we sought to have the costs and benefits of these reliefs exposed before the budget in order that could have a realistic debate about the sort of choices we made.  That was refused time and again.  It comes as no surprise that they were left there for too long and built up an unsustainable property bubble because that was the way the system was designed.  The Government did not want scrutiny or cross-examination of those measures.  It wanted to intro<Col N="261"/>duce them like rabbits out of the hat on budget day to curry favour with people who were in the property sector.  That is the way the system was run and that must be changed.</P>
        <P>It is unacceptable to pretend we can have changes elsewhere and no change at home.  No targets were set on what spending would deliver.  Year in and year out the Minister came to the House and announced spending in the year was up 12% compared to the previous year.  No Minister ever said: &ldquo;This is what we will deliver and I will stake my reputation on that, and there will be accountability&rdquo;.  Instead, we had waste, money was spent, no results were delivered and no one was ever held accountable.  That is the system the Minister stands over and will not change.  Not today, not last year, not at any stage in this crisis has the Minister shown any willingness to change that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The system must change if we are to have a grown-up response to the crisis that has been created.  The final insult is that the whole package is voted on in one final vote and it is all over at midnight.  We end up with a budget that has created many of the problems yet no serious attempt is made to address the nature of the budget and its appropriateness to our needs.  The system must be reformed.</P>
        <P>I would have been encouraged if the Minister had indicated a willingness to respond to what is needed.  To give the European Union its due, it has referred to the need for some parliamentary involvement at an early stage.  I would have welcomed a reference from the Minister of the need for serious parliamentary involvement throughout the process and for proper scrutiny and the examination of options.  If that had been said we would be encouraged to see that things are changing, but that is not what is happening.  The real problem is that we are now having foisted on top of the current dysfunctional budgeting system a pre-vetting system that will take place in Europe.  I worry about how that will impact on future budgets.  We need to question such an approach and to examine whether it will provide the type of economic strategy that the country needs.  There are strong reasons for suspecting that it will not.</P>
        <P>It is not just that I am unhappy with the Minister&rsquo;s strategy, but the Commission itself has not been successful in developing a growth strategy.  Its understanding or ability to implement the broader element required to make the eurozone a success is seriously open to question.  The more I read the clearer it is that the primary focus of European finance Ministers is fiscal retrenchment.  It is the sum total of the recipe that is evident.  I do not detect a need to confront the fact that Germany is running huge surpluses and is pursuing a strategy that is dramatically different to what is necessary to have a convergence of economies within a single zone.  Just as the deficit countries have to learn to live in a eurozone, the strong countries also have to learn what it takes to lead a successful currency zone that will work not just in the short term and for all the members.</P>
        <P>I worry too about the pre-vetting process.  Before the wider civil society of the community come to confront the problems there will be a grave sense that the thing is stitched up, that a decision has been taken by Government and the eurozone and then we are in a straitjacket.  Let us be honest; the only way we will solve our problems is if wider society shares a sense of commitment and a unified sense of purpose around core strategic changes that we will undertake.  That is what we must secure and put in place.  I do not deny that Europe has a very important input to make into the debate.  Nor do I deny that Europe has a right to impose sanctions if we wilfully ignore the interests of the eurozone.  I fully agree with that.  However, I gravely worry about a system that involves pre-vetting of budgets and pre-setting of sanctions and only when the budget arrives in the House would it be available to the wider civil society to debate the options to resolve the crisis.</P>
        <P>The thinking of the eurozone is too narrow.  We will not enlist the vital support of the broader community if that is the way it is perceived budgets will be developed in future, namely, the <Col N="262"/>Government will go to Brussels where the parameters will be set out and penalties will attach to any deviance and then one hopes people will rally around.  That approach will not work although I would support it.</P>
        <P>Far from being a eurosceptic, I recognise that the eurozone has to make serious changes if it is to succeed but I do not subscribe to the view that prior fixing of the budgetary stance will serve us well.  Governments in France and Germany are saying something not dissimilar to what I am saying.  I am not in a eurosceptic band of one.  Many take a similar view about the role of national Parliaments.  That is not to say we do not understand the vital importance of the eurozone.  We understand its needs and we accept we must integrate them into the way we think.</P>
        <P>It is vital that Irish parliamentary democracy and the people we represent takes ownership of the process of becoming successful members of a eurozone that imposes real constraints.  In the good years we did not learn to manage with those constraints and we must learn how to do that.  Far from dismissing the criticism I have heard from numerous Ministers, the Government should be spelling out how it will radically reform the budgetary system so that we start to get a broader view.  We need to internalise those necessary corrections of the catastrophic policy errors that were made in recent years.  We can only do that if a new strategy is developed at home for job growth, reform and transformation and creating a much more successful country than the phoney success that passed as achievement in the Celtic tiger years.  It was glitzy and garish but it did not represent the sort of success to which society genuinely aspired.</P>
        <P>We must get to grips with some fairly unpalatable changes in our community.  First, we have to revolutionise the way we spend money.  The Minister must take responsibility and commit to that as part of the process.  We need to undertake deep-seated reform in the way we structure and deliver public services.  The Croke Park agreement is singularly unambitious in terms of the sort of transformation we need in order to provide public services.  The change we need must be much more dramatic than what is being envisaged, namely, longer working days and the ability to deploy staff from one place to another.  Welcome and all as those changes are the wonder is that it has taken so long to get to them.  The highly centralised command and control system that we have foisted on many parts of the public service and that is underwritten by the national agreements are hostile to the kind of reform required to deliver value at local level.  We need to recognise that and to start devolving power.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Every analysis of the public service from the OECD report on has been highly critical of our unwillingness to devolve power and make people accountable for results.  We set up quangos but they have vague mandates and no accountability.  We must embrace serious reform and that is equally important if we are to get our fiscal correction right.  We must have an ambitious plan to build strong economic arteries such as the electricity system, broadband system and water system.  They are creaking at the edges and are uncompetitive.  We will not build a strong export-led recovery based on the current standards of those facilities.  That must be core to a successful recovery plan.  We need to move rapidly to have policies that will keep young talented people at home.</P>
     
        <P>Eurozone countries looking in at Ireland will regard the movement of people to work in Frankfort, Sydney or New York as a good thing because it represents labour mobility.  We have a different view of the issue, however.  We do not want to see the talented people who can create a strong economy at home going to other countries to make a living.  This is why it is important that we maintain control of our people&rsquo;s destiny.</P>
        <P>I support what is being done here but I want to see a more robust agenda of reform at home and an emboldened Minister who can say on my behalf &mdash; because I will not have the oppor<Col N="263"/>tunity to do so &mdash; that our Parliament wants to come to terms with the mistakes we made and to shape our own destiny.  We do not want to be second fiddle to programmes designed elsewhere.  The European Commission is making proposals but many other governments think like I do.  Together, we can use this opportunity to create something genuinely better with parliamentary participation at the core.  Paradoxically, the biggest obstacle to the scrutiny we need in this House is at home rather than in the Commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to raise several questions about the Bill in advance of Committee Stage.  What will be the status of the Irish money?  It appears that, <i>pari passu</i>, it will have the same status as the rest.  The strategy rightly has been criticised as replacing bank loans with state funds.  When the IMF deals with this type of situation, does it act in the same way or does it accord preferential status to the new money it introduces?  What is IMF practice in regard to supports of this nature and are we applying similar techniques?  The Irish taxpayer would be interested in knowing how this will work.</P>
        <P>Who decides if Greece is not compliant?  There appears to be a vagueness in this regard.  I am aware it is supposed to achieve a deficit cut of 11% but how will that work out in practice?  If it produces 10.5%, will that be the end of the loan facility and who will make the judgment call?  At an earlier stage, I got the impression that each government could decide to be involved on a case-by-case basis after an examination of Greek performance.  Is it now a collective decision and, if so, on whose recommendation will it be made?  How will that process work?  It is important to the credibility of the exercise that it be successful.  Clearly, people do not want to see backsliding from the commitments that have been made but equally they do not want such officious application of tests that they become unrealistic or impose unfair terms on the Greek Parliament and people.  What happens in response to unforeseen events?  If Greece&rsquo;s 11% deficit cut turns out to be based on forecasts of growth that do not materialise, how will that be addressed in practical terms?</P>
        <P>I welcome that the Minister will revert to the House on the other dimensions in a legal form because that will give us an opportunity to debate the issue as it develops into a package of measures.  Perhaps we will actually see some openness while the Ministers negotiate so that we can hold a parallel discussion.</P>

	<P>I cannot fully brief the Deputy because I do not yet have a final text but I will do so as soon as I obtain it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Back in 1975, US President Gerald Ford spoke about the possibility of a federal bailout for New York city.  His response was clear, simple and made famous by the front page headline the following day: &ldquo;Drop Dead&rdquo;.  New York was in a similar situation then to where Greece finds itself today.  It was spending too much, taxing too little, at the mercy of the market and threatened with default.  So close was New York to bankruptcy that a petition was being filed in the state supreme court, the police cars had been mobilised to serve the papers on the banks and the mayor had written a speech to break the bad news.</P>
        <P>What some may remember, but most probably will not, is that the day was saved by New York&rsquo;s trade unions.  With an emergency budget already in the pipeline, complete with a doomsday list of spending cuts which would have decimated essential public services, everyone thought the game was up.  At the last possible moment, labour leaders selflessly pledged the use of union members&rsquo; retirement funds to back the city&rsquo;s loans and stave off bankruptcy.</P>
        <P>In Europe, we now face a similar choice.  What is to be Ireland&rsquo;s response?  Do we act in the spirit of solidarity or do we decide to take our chances on our own and condemn our neighbours to the same fate?  Is it to be each to its own or one for all and all for one?  Solidarity is a guiding principle not just of the European Union but of the Labour Party.  We believe in looking out <Col N="264"/>for our neighbours and in helping those in need to help themselves.  As a country, Ireland has benefited enormously from the solidarity of our European neighbours.  We were the greatest per capita recipient of European Structural Funds and are still a massive net recipient through the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
        <P>Ireland was once the sick man of Europe but look how far we have come.  Notwithstanding our recent fall from grace and Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s wrecking of our economy, it remains true that we have converged with European norms in terms of living standards.  Through the wise use of European funds by successive Governments, our national infrastructure has enjoyed a quantum leap forward in the decades since we joined the EEC in 1973.  Our farms have been able to modernise and to compete at a global level through the judicious use of CAP.  When Ireland was on its knees, Europe did not abandon us.  With Greece now at the mercy of global bond markets, it is our duty to hang together because, if not, we may well hang separately.</P>
        <P>Underpinning the European project and the concept of ever closer economic, monetary and political union is the overarching principle of solidarity.  Some say that money makes the world go round but in Europe, solidarity is the glue that binds together nations with a shared history, identity and destiny.  The people who founded the European Union wanted to put an end to war on the continent after centuries of conflict.  We truly are all in this together, regardless of whether we sink or swim.</P>
        <P>Greece needs to reform its budget and to get its economy in shape but without the breathing space provided by this solidarity agreement over a relatively short three year period, its fate will be infinitely worse.  In Ireland, we are not without our own direct interest in saving Greece.  Greece was identified by the bond markets as the weakest link, but markets are subject to irrational herd instincts and sometimes make the wrong call.  While Ireland&rsquo;s economy is very different to that of Greece &mdash; with substantial inward investment from the multinational sector &mdash; we can just as easily become a target for bond traders who, having finished off Greece, may move on to other weaker countries such as Portugal, Spain and Ireland.  This argument in favour of supporting Greece could be referred to as selfish solidarity, calling to mind Richard Dawkins&rsquo;s references to the selfish gene.</P>
        <P>The world is in the grip of a form of hyper-financial capital which operates on a global basis at incredible speed.  Ironically, a large component of modern funds for investment is made up of workers&rsquo; pension funds.  As has been remarked, these can be as much the holders of sovereign bonds as hedge funds and private equity.  It would be ironic if workers&rsquo; pension funds, a concept developed by Social and Christian Democrats, were to be the instrument for devouring a country such as Greece.  This subject will have to be returned to by the trade union movement and the holders and trustees of workers&rsquo; pension funds.</P>
        <P>We have seen in recent weeks the cost of division in Europe and the futility of struggling alone on the rough seas of the global bond market.  Caught between Chancellor Merkel&rsquo;s policy of prevarication and the bond market&rsquo;s ruthless rent-seeking, Greece has been subjected to the nation state equivalent of waterboarding, as expressed by the former Danish Prime Minister, Mr. Paul Rasmussen.  As moments of light relief go, it is nice to see Mr. Anders Borg, the Swedish Finance Minister, with his earring and ponytail, among the other Finance Ministers.  He spoke recently about the wolf-pack behaviour of markets and how they would tear the weaker countries apart.  Mr. Will Hutton, the noted British economist and former editor of <i>The Observer</i> was in Dublin last week, at the invitation of the trade union movement, for a series of important debates about Ireland&rsquo;s future direction.  He spoke about hunter gatherers who eat what they kill.  That is how he, somebody with long experience of the bond markets, characterised traders.  It is not in our interest to let the hunter gatherers in the bond markets kill <Col N="265"/>Greece and eat it because, having done so, they will undoubtedly turn their attention to the next weakest animal in the pack.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the package of support for Greece is to prevent the first domino falling in the form of a Greek default.  We are not today discussing the &euro;750 billion stability mechanism.  Nor are we discussing the draft Commission proposal on reinforcing economic policy co-ordination.  Suffice to say the eurozone has a problem, just as we do in Ireland.  What is required is substantial reform of public services.  We must bring down the deficits, but we must do so while still investing in infrastructure and innovation so that we and the eurozone can maintain and improve competitiveness.  If we have the hunter gatherers trying to pick us off as the weakest in the pack, we must work to become stronger.  I lived in Africa for a time and often had an opportunity to observe the antics of hyenas and hunting dogs.  The strongest pack is the one that shelters its young and ensures that they, as the weaker elements, do not easily become prey.</P>
        <P>Too much deflation, too quickly and in the wrong areas, will simply lead to complete depression, huge reductions in income and major increases in unemployment.  Ironically, the bond markets, seemingly wishing to have it both ways, reflected this in recent days when they priced down the euro on the basis of fears that growth in the eurozone will not be sufficient.  The European Union&rsquo;s Stability and Growth Pact was signed in Dublin.  Stability and growth are two sides of the same coin called economic security.  If we have one without the other, the system itself will be inherently unstable.  To all intents and purposes, the Stability and Growth Pact is dead for a variety of reasons.  In better times, it was more honoured in the breach.  Before pointing the finger at countries like Ireland, Greece, Spain or Portugal, it should be recalled that some of the larger countries, by virtue of their size, were able to get away with actions never contemplated by smaller states.  However, that is now consigned to history.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  It should be remembered that we lived within the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, which proves its inadequacy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>At a time of crisis, the pact has been found to be a completely inappropriate framework.  The reality is that if we are serious about making a success of monetary union, we must go back to the drawing board. </P>
        <P>The discussion document published last week was a useful contribution in this regard, but it puts forward only one point of view.  Its core aim seems to be to make Europe more German, when what may be needed is also to make Germany more European.  Aristotle, the most renowned of all Greek philosophers, is famous for his conception of the golden mean, the desirable middle of two extremes between excess and deficiency.  This was a founding principle of the European project, that one&rsquo;s affairs could be managed so that one could, with caution and carefulness, enjoy the fruits of growth.  The European Union needs to find its golden mean between a German Europe and a European Germany.  Facing the deepest recession since the European project was constructed amid the devastating aftermath of the Second World War, member states have responded with appropriate fiscal stimuli and unprecedented bank bailouts.  What began as a financial crisis has become a broad-based economic crisis and latterly a sovereign debt crisis.  Those countries in a weaker financial state before the crisis have been left most exposed.  Ireland&rsquo;s saving grace has been its relatively low stock of national debt, although when NAMA and so on are priced into the balance sheet, that situation will change.  We have only a window of opportunity in this particular game and the headroom on our national debt is one of the few factors separating us from the Greeks.</P>
        <P>Advanced economies, in Europe and worldwide, may well be on the verge of an age of austerity as they attempt to get their deficits and national debt under control, but there are <Col N="266"/>two sides to the equation of long-term debt sustainability.  Deficits must come down and the size of the national debt must be brought significantly below the size of the economy which supports it.  However, we also need growth and investment in innovation.  One of the issues in regard to the European Union which causes me to weep is that it has proved to be so long on talk and so short on delivery.  The purpose of the Lisbon Agenda was to make Europe a competitive and humane society with good public services, including health and education systems, and active, private markets.  It was in achieving this golden balance between the public and private that Europe would secure the best and most optimistic outturn.  I am afraid this outturn was not delivered.</P>
        <P>I worry that with centre-right governments in power in most European countries Europe will veer towards excessive fiscal rectitude, resulting in more unemployment and job losses and a failure to engage with the innovation and growth that would enable the Continent to become competitive in the world market.  Europe&rsquo;s economies must grow if they are to reduce the burden of debt.  Every time someone is put back to work, the State no longer has to pay &euro;10,000 per annum in social welfare benefits.  After a period of employment, the person also starts to pay PRSI and income tax.  This is how one reduces the deficit.</P>
        <P>As consumers buy more, increased VAT receipts replenish the Government&rsquo;s coffers.  If all European countries were to try to deflate their economies in search of the Holy Grail of an export-led recovery, we would embark on a disastrous downward deflationary spiral with a beggar my neighbour outcome.  What makes sense for an individual country may not make sense for Europe as a whole.  Put another way, if all of Europe were to try to emulate Germany by having limited consumer spending, we could all end up like Greece, with a collapsed economy coupled with a massive debt overhang.  Such a scenario is clearly not in anyone&rsquo;s interest.</P>
        <P>When we go back to the drawing board on the Stability and Growth Pact, whether through a European monetary fund or an alternative mechanism, we need to place at centre stage the need for greater innovation, growth in investment and employment and new opportunities for young graduates and apprentices who are the future of European economies.  I have spoken to the Minister previously about the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposals to establish a strategic investment bank to invest in innovation and public infrastructure and to introduce a graduate internship system.  Under this system, rather than being offered slightly less than &euro;200 per week on the dole, graduates would be taken on in the public and private sectors, including by professional firms, local projects or non-governmental organisations, and their employer would be exempt from employer&rsquo;s PRSI.  In return, employers would augment the dole money paid to the graduates they employ.  This would get people into work and doing something useful.  It is essential that the Minister and his fellow Finance Ministers do not decide to engage in a collective form of depression economics that focuses entirely on making cutbacks and reducing deficits.  While these types of measures are necessary, they must be balanced by opportunities for growth.</P>
        <P>The Irish contribution to the pooled bilateral loans to Greece to be provided as part of a lenders&rsquo; club, as it were, overseen by the European Central Bank will be 1.64% or &euro;1.3 billion, while Germany will contribute 28% to the fund.  This is a large amount of money for both countries but should be seen in the context of an historical analogy.  After the Second World War, when Germany lay in ruins following the disastrous regime of Hitler, the country was boosted by the Marshall Plan and the American dollar.  The Marshall Plan had an impact all over Europe, including to a small degree in Ireland.  One of the tragedies of this country, however, was that we did not benefit significantly from the Marshall Plan.  The money loaned to Europe under the plan was ultimately paid back.  Much of what one sees in modern Europe, particularly in Germany, the country that was defeated in the Second World War, was built using the funds provided under the plan.  These moneys were used to rebuild the country, to <Col N="267"/>invest in its technology and to create the modern consumer products on which the German economic miracle was built.</P>
        <P>Europe has, therefore, experience of structural assistance that worked.  We are also long time members of the International Monetary Fund, another club of countries which contributes to countries experiencing economic difficulties, especially in the developing world, albeit not always in a manner of which I approve.  Living in Tanzania in the 1980s when the IMF arrived to impose a structural adjustment programme, I saw the men from the IMF, with their shiny briefcases and gold tipped fountain pens, write their reports as they lounged at the side of swimming pools.  These reports required the country to cut primary education &mdash; African girls dropped out of education in every country the IMF introduced a structural programme &mdash; and eliminate primary health care, with the result that increasingly large numbers of children died from preventable and curable diseases such as malaria.</P>
        <P>As a country involved in a pooling of interests with the International Monetary Fund, we must think long and hard and keep a tight grip on the fund.  While I am aware that the current managing director, Mr. Strauss-Kahn, has changed many IMF policies, we must ensure that what is being done to people in Greece and Ireland is translated into income and employment.</P>
        <P>Thinking about the position in Greece brought to mind the contribution of its theatre and authors to our literature and consciousness.  In Greek myth, Icarus flew too close to the sun because he believed himself to be invincible.  Modern finance capital also flies too close to the sun because it believes the mere human beings who look to those who play the markets like ants on the ground are of no significance.  This issue must be addressed globally.</P>
        <P>Greece also gave us the legend of King Midas.  I hope the Minister is not offended when I say the legend appears to apply to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  While King Midas worshipped gold, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party worshipped bankers and developers.  I will leave the Minister to catch up on what happened to the king during his bedtime reading.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Deputy did not refer to our local Icarus. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>What did our King Midas, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, do?  It stoked tax breaks.  What did the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, do when a proposal was made to impose a 1% stamp duty on contracts for difference?  He argued that such a measure would reduce the power of the market to act as it saw fit.  Greeks also talk about hubris, that is, acting in a manner that brings about one&rsquo;s own downfall.</P>
        <P>This is an historic moment and we must not think only in terms of the package provided to Greece.  While I believe this package is appropriate, it is also tough and I do not know if the Greeks will make it, particularly in the three year timeframe.  We also need to examine the proposals the Minister will make in a week or two concerning the &euro;750 billion stabilisation mechanism.    We will also have to look in great detail at these initial proposals by the European Commission on oversights and guiding the budgetary process of member states.  The Lisbon treaty promised that parliaments would be far more engaged before Ministers went to Brussels and that we would be informed, advised and consulted on decisions.  Decision making is the prerogative of a national parliament, and in our system, of the Government of the day that commands a majority.  It would be extraordinary if the Commission were to have sight of our budget in broad terms but we in this Parliament were not to have such sight, or more importantly, if the citizens of Ireland were not to be told through a parliamentary forum what exactly our Government was proposing to the Commission.</P>
        <P>I heard the Minister for Social Protection at the weekend proposing a serious think about people who had paid a contributory pension in good faith.  If such people ended up with more than one pension, then their contributory pension might be taken from them.  As somebody <Col N="268"/>who worked in the social welfare area, I do not understand how that can be done.  This is an example of a kite being flown by a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister in order to set the terms of a debate.  It may well be that in the next budget, Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s real target is child benefit.</P>
        <P>I was once a member of a local authority and the county manager explained that the council always came up with four to five proposals for a site for a landfill, three or four of which were non-runners.  If the European Commission is to give advice and have oversight of our budget, it would be extraordinary if Fianna F&aacute;il was to withhold that information from this Parliament.  It is extraordinary that Fianna F&aacute;il has embarked on a tactic whereby the Minister for Social Protection has been encouraged to run out and suggest that the contributory old age pension may no longer be an entitlement for people who have contributed to it.  Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers may have a comment or two about that, but it is extraordinary that we have no budgetary process in this Parliament.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance is now entering a round of discussion with the line Ministers in each Department.  One line Minister has thrown out this idea.  We do not know if it is a serious idea.  I suspect it is a kite, but we have no forum in which to discuss it.  The purpose of all this is a media setting agenda, and to make this a fevered subject of talk and speculation.  Perhaps Fianna F&aacute;il will then back down and reassure people that they are alright, before moving on to its real targets.</P>
        <P>The Commission proposal to have oversight of member states&rsquo; budgetary plans must give rise to long required reforms in this House to allow for a meaningful discussion of the budget.  A budget means a plan for the next year, but this House does not even get to discuss the budget until after it has been announced.  The Labour Party supports the proposal in respect of solidarity with Greece.  We want to get more information about the &euro;750 billion stabilisation fund.  In particular, we want provision for a thorough debate of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals on information co-ordination and guidelines for budgets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill as it provides evidence of eurozone states supporting each other, and this support has never been more welcome than at the moment.</P>
        <P>Over the past few months, there has been severe turbulence in the international money markets.  As a result, some states have experienced civil disorder as they try to correct the financial mistakes of the past.  It is to the credit of the Government, and particularly the Minister for Finance, that Ireland took corrective action immediately when the problem became apparent.  This corrective action has been very painful to all the citizens of Ireland and it would be foolhardy in the extreme to expect that all the pain is over.  It is not over and we all know that another &euro;3 billion has to be found in the budget later this year.  However, the less well off must be protected.</P>
        <P>As a result of the financial turbulence, certain countries are being bracketed with Greece, such as Spain and Portugal.  These two countries have announced severe austerity measures in the past few days and are now following the example given by Ireland.  However, one of the most alarming consequences of this financial turbulence has been a direct attack on the euro itself.  It is vitally important that the euro currency remains strong.  The passing of this Bill is a step towards protecting our currency because, should the euro fail, the consequences for Ireland would be catastrophic.  That is why I believe, welcome and all as this Bill is, that it does not go far enough.</P>
        <P>We all realise that some countries in the eurozone are stronger economically than others, such as Germany and France.  Over the past number of days, very worrying signals are emanating from both these countries that they may not continue to support the euro in the future.  If they were in any way to weaken their resolve in support of the euro, we would be faced with <Col N="269"/>an economic whirlwind, the likes of which the country has never experienced.  We all hope that it does not happen, and it must not be allowed to happen.  A stable euro is vital to Ireland&rsquo;s recovery, but the agreement between the eurozone states, welcome and all as it is, does not go far enough to maintain faith in the euro.</P>
        <P>Strong, decisive and unambiguous messages need to be sent to the international money markets that the euro will be maintained and international speculators are wasting their time attacking the currency.  I want the Government to work with our eurozone partners to show decisive commitment to protecting the euro and any talk of a two-speed euro, which is a possibility if the stronger economic countries withdraw their support for it, will only be speculation.  To get out of the financial difficulties Ireland is currently facing, it is vital that we have a stable euro.  A two-speed euro would have disastrous consequences for Ireland and there would be an immediate outflow of funds from the country.  It would undo all the good work that has been done to correct our public finances.  All the pain that the public have suffered would be undone.</P>
        <P>I ask the Government to work and secure a firm commitment from all the countries in the eurozone that they will work together to help support the euro.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister and his officials for all the work they have done on the Bill and on the entire financial situation that pertains in our country and throughout the eurozone at this point in time.  Ireland along with all the other eurozone countries has agreed to assist Greece through the issue of loans, which Greece must repay within a fixed time period.  We are not paying money to Greece; we are lending it money and it is important that we all understand that.  If Ireland needs to borrow money to fund these loans it will be at a lower rate than Greece is paying us back, allowing the State to make a profit.  While it should not be about profit, we need to have cognisance of our situation in Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that not only is there a financial return to the State for providing these loans, but there is also a far wider economic return safeguarding financial stability in the eurozone.  That cannot be overstated.  It is vital for all of us that we have a stable euro currency and that we safeguard the situation throughout Europe.  We cannot under any circumstances allow any undermining of the euro.  We cannot even entertain any implied threats that we might have a two-tier system for some countries regarding support for the euro.  This cannot be accepted in any shape, make or form.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Stability is essential for businesses, citizens and the State.  Businesses need financial stability to trade with our European and global partners.  We all know how difficult it now is for businesses to stay alive and have the cash flow they require on a weekly and daily basis to meet their commitments to pay for wages, commodities, imports etc.  It is vital to have financial stability for our businesses whether they be big or small.  I refer to small and medium-sized businesses right up to some major organisations.  Without that stability they cannot have the confidence to continue trading and the banks may not have the funding to support those businesses, which they had a commitment to support heretofore.  In many cases they are withdrawing that commitment and are uneasy about it probably because they do not have the financial certainty or stability that is required on a euro-wide basis.</P>
        <P>As citizens, all of us need financial stability to spend and invest with confidence, which is vital for every household in the country regardless of their income.  I know many of them are very chastened and worried at this point.  Above all confidence is required to allow people to be able to go about their business and live as normal a life as possible in difficult circumstances.  By spending their money prudently they can give a boost to businesses.  It is a holistic situation <Col N="270"/>as far as I am concerned and if the consumer does not have the confidence to make ordinary day-to-day spending or invest in a new car or house renovations etc., we know what that leads to.  We have seen too much of that in the past 18 months since the financial crash.  In this regard the bankers have a major responsibility.  While we have ring-fenced in the business stabilisation fund certain funding for the bankers to lend, clearly they are not doing this.</P>
        <P>This bailout needs to be seen as a total commitment by Government and now by extension from governments of all the European countries to stabilise the situation in Greece.  Above anything else we will not be at any loss for doing it, but we need to stabilise the euro currency.  This country has a proud record of supporting many countries throughout the world in times of dire need going back over generations.  In the present situation in which Greece and we find ourselves, I welcome the austerity measures that Greece has introduced despite the upsetting reaction.  We understand where we are ourselves that we have had to do a major job of financial rectitude.  We are well on the road to doing that but it is not easy.  I compliment the citizens of this State for accepting their share.  We all need to accept our share.  There is no point in having the blame game.  We all made many mistakes, including bankers.  We are all in it together, ordinary people, investors from Ministers down and bankers.  We know where we are and what we need to do.  We need to find another &euro;3 billion, which will not be easy this year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I came into the Chamber Deputy Burton referred to the comments of the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, which was timely.  From my point of view there is no question of vulnerable people, including old-age pensioners, being undermined or having money taken from them by the Government, because I, for one, would not stand for it.  We need to look at every euro that is spent and examine how it is spent to ensure that it goes to the most needy and deserving.  In this context what we are doing for Greece is also vital.  It needs to be spent fairly and there needs to be a plan.  Here at home we need to examine where every euro is spent and that the most needy are getting it.  While I know people have entitlements, if people are in a comfortable position, they may not need as much as the people who are in need and may be on a small single pension in a household.  We need to look after those people.</P>
        <P>My party has a proud record of looking after the pensioners.  I intend to ensure that continues, which I am sure is the intention of the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and the Cabinet.  It is a matter of examining the system.  It is only May and the budget will not be announced until the end of the year.  It is timely.  The media have picked up on it which is also welcome.  I resent the scare tactics from Opposition parties which understand how bad the situation is.  We need to ensure that the most needy are looked after.</P>
        <P>EU governments are confident that the new Greek Government is making determined efforts to meet its fiscal and structural challenges.  The significant reforms announced on 2 May are clear evidence of this commitment.  Those reforms needed to be announced and acted upon before any other European states could give their backing to the euro area loan facility.  It is important that we would have the confidence now as partners in Europe given that it has made those commitments.  While we see that taking place we should not shirk from our responsibilities and should provide this necessary propping up of a fellow member state.  Given the difficult times we are in, we must show solidarity with our European partners and we cannot turn our backs on a fellow European state in its time of need.  Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We never know at what time in the future we might have different crises other than financial ones.  As we have seen recently with ash problem from the volcanic eruption, we do not know what kind of act of nature or God might defeat us all.  We are not mightier than the man above.  Anything can happen and we always need to understand from where we have come and where <Col N="271"/>we are going.  We should try to support our colleagues as we would expect the same support from them, which I feel we would also get.</P>
        <P>We need to send the message to the world markets that the EU as a unit is strong and acting in unison.  We need to try to bring all the countries on to a level playing field to ensure that they are supported while they are committed to putting their own houses in order.  People can claim that Greece was reckless as they can claim that Ireland was reckless.  We were and we are paying the price now but thankfully we are not in the same situation.  Nobody knows how long we might be involved or the different reasons.  It is not for us to apportion punishment or blame but to realise that mistakes were made, be man or woman enough to admit them and support everybody who admits to making a mistake.  A person who never made a mistake never made very much and that applies also from a business point of view.</P>
        <P>We all made mistakes and Greece probably made them to a bigger extent but now it is trying to sort out its problems.  It is vital that we, as a Government and as a country along with all EU countries, provide that necessary shoulder and support for a colleague country in a difficult time.  However, we must not contemplate any undermining of the euro.  That is vital for all member states.  We must not give any credence, lip service, engagement or discussion to the mention of a two-tier euro.  I know where such talk comes from, as we all do.  That would be totally counterproductive and bad for the eurozone.  It would send out the wrong messages and we cannot afford that.</P>
        <P>We are making a profit on this, not that we wish to crow about it, but it is important that the citizens of the State should understand that.  It is not throwing money into a black hole as has been enunciated by some people but a matter of supporting a colleague state and, in so doing, making a profit.  There will be a risk for the three-year period during which we must pay our share.  I hope all member states will play their fair part although a bigger portion is involved for other countries.  It would be an undermining of the entire eurozone if any of our colleague states did not engage fully, step up to the plate and support Greece at this time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for listening and I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I am sharing time with Deputy Mitchell.  </P>
        <P>My party will support this Bill.  However, I find it strange that the Bill was signed by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the State on 7 May yet we had to wait ten or 11 days before the House could debate the issues.  The debate we are having is based on the legislation but the first tranche of money went to Greece this morning.  I agree in principle with what we are doing but we need more debate, detail and disclosure which, to date, we have not got from this Government.</P>
        <P>What is proposed is like the bank guarantee scheme the Government brought in that fateful night of 29 September.  We did not debate that scheme until it was already in place.  Concerning that scheme and Anglo Irish Bank, Michael Somers, the former chief executive officer of the National Treasury Management Agency, stated that for a long period prior to the scheme he was reluctant to give deposits to Anglo Irish Bank.  Alarm bells were going off.</P>
        <P>The Government should have had contingency plans in place for Anglo Irish Bank.  It treated it in a different way when the guarantee scheme came into place where, effectively, the bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank were not guaranteed unlike those in the other institutions.  There should have been a contingency plan.  If there was one, was it acted upon or why was it not <Col N="272"/>acted upon?  These questions must be asked.  I hope the Minister for Finance will answer them when he replies to this debate and that the bank inquiry will deal with the matter.</P>
        <P>The measures proposed in this Bill will deal with short-term liquidity for Greece but will not address the country&rsquo;s long-term solvency issue which is key.  We must look at this and ask whether this measure will bring about a situation whereby the euro will be protected, Greece will solve its financial crisis and will be in a position to repay the loans advanced to it from the other member states.  I would also like to have detail on another matter.  It appears that Ireland and other EU member states, although I can only speak in respect of Ireland, will lend money to Greece, ranking <i>pari passu </i>with existing private bondholders to the Greek State.  The private investors in Greece would have known what they were investing in but Ireland is entering a bail-out package.  I ask the Minister whether this will be ranked in the same way or to explain the position.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated this assistance programme is to have quarterly reviews but according to section 4 of the Bill the Minister will provide only an annual report.  This latter report should mirror the quarterly reviews to be carried out in respect of the assistance programme and should be given to the House on a quarterly basis.  This sum of &euro;1.3 billion is a significant amount of money for the State and there will be another &euro;7.5 billion to come for the European financial stability mechanism.  That would be our share.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must support the eurozone and I am very pro-European.  However, in this House, as I have noticed since I was elected, there is a lack of detail and willingness to debate issues.  This happens consistently every year in regard to budgets.  There is no proper debate in advance.  We are presented with a pre-budget outlook and the actual budget on the day, with no discussion.  I reiterate there was no prior discussion on coming into place of the guarantee scheme when it is clear there were advance warnings in the banking sector, particularly in respect of Anglo Irish Bank.  The guarantee scheme was brought in on the day and tucked into it was the detail that subordinated debt of lower tier 2 was guaranteed.  There are questions to be answered.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In terms of what is provided in this Bill, the annual report should be a quarterly one.  We must ask where our debt ranks in regard to other debt.  We must also look to protecting the euro, which is important.  People will say the euro is depreciating in value against other currencies and that is happening.  It will boost our exports but the currency is falling especially against the US dollar, although not so much against sterling.  This will increase the cost of imported fuel which is denominated in US dollars.  The actual fuel may not rise in price but the price will rise for us because of depreciation of the euro.  Furthermore, with the depreciation of the euro the cost of borrowing may increase.  The money raised today on the bond market by the National Treasury Management Agency was at 4.7% although it was offered at 4.5%.  These are issues we must look at.</P>
        <P>Deputy McGrath, unlike the Taoiseach, is now on the record of the D&aacute;il as saying the Government was reckless and mistakes were made.  However, we find the Taoiseach unwilling to admit these things.  I saw his recent 7,500 word monologue described as like the excuse of the little boy who came into class and said the dog had eaten his homework.  What we got was, effectively, an abdication of responsibility.  The Taoiseach must attend the House and admit the Government was reckless during his period.  He referred to the property tax schemes that were implemented and said he stopped them.  He became Minister for Finance in December 2004.  Most of those schemes did not finish until July 2008.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />welcomes the final report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children published on 16 February, 2010;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I propose to share five minutes of my time with Deputy Liz McManus and 20 minutes with Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  I move this motion tonight in my name and that of my Labour and Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, in the shadow of yet another tragic death, this time a murder of a child in the care of the HSE.  We do not know the full story of the life and death of Daniel McAnaspie but what we know is disquieting and a cause of real concern.  As we have done already today and will do collectively tonight, I send our heartfelt and real condolences to Daniel&rsquo;s family.  We must also resolve to do more.</P>
        <P>In February 2007, more than three years ago, the then Government presented the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill to this House.  After many years of debate and consideration, there was consensus that we needed to change the Constitution to give greater rights to children.</P>
        <P>Children&rsquo;s rights organisations, some of which are represented here tonight, had long argued for change but the vulnerability of children, their lack of unique constitutional presence and the consequences of this position had become a matter of real and urgent concern.  Going back to the conclusions of the Kilkenny incest case of 1993, Deputy Shatter and I would remember well how a committee of investigation was set up, with a then senior counsel, Catherine McGuinness, now Ms Justice Catherine McGuiness, asked to head the investigation.  Among the important recommendations of the group was that &ldquo;a specific and overt declaration of the rights of born children&rdquo; be included in the Constitution.</P>
        <P>Since 1993, a number of other reports or court cases involving individual children and their families have continued to raise the question of the apparent conflict between the best interests of children and the rights and duties of married parents.  In too many cases, professionals or <Col N="274"/>courts involved in decisions relating to children made decisions on the basis of our current constitutional balance and failed to act in the interests of the child.  Children met with harm, sometimes unimaginable harm, because of this approach.</P>
        <P>This House has debated many of these cases and reports over the past 15 years.  In 2007 it was decided that we needed to act to bring about real and substantial change and the Government published a constitutional amendment Bill.  The 2007 Bill, which proposed the insertion of a new Article 42(A) in the Constitution, was referred to an all-party committee for detailed consideration.  The committee met weekly and examined in very minute detail, as the Minister of State will remember, the law relating to children.</P>
        <P>In September 2008 the committee presented its first interim report, dealing with a proposal to give legal authority for the collection and limited exchange of information concerning the risk of the endangerment, sexual exploitation or sexual abuse of children.  It was our unanimous view that the gathering and limited exchange of so-called &ldquo;soft information&rdquo; could be achieved by legislation without the need for a constitutional change.  Since this was a prime recommendation in the Ferns inquiry report and featured in other horrific cases such as the Soham murder case, where Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman were murdered by local school caretaker, Ian Huntley, the committee believed urgent legislation was required.  We made the recommendation in September 2008.  Unfortunately, one year and eight months later we still await the publication of this important Bill.</P>
        <P>The committee then set to work on the difficult and complicated proposal to give legal authority to create offences of absolute or strict liability in respect of sexual offences against or in connection with children.  That work was completed and a detailed second interim report was presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in May 2009.  The majority of the committee recommended the creation of offences by legislative means.  We again await the response of Government to this very detailed report; here too urgently required legislation that mobilised thousands of people outside this House has been long promised yet undelivered.</P>
        <P>The third and final phase of the committee&rsquo;s work deals with the remaining issues of required constitutional change.  Specifically, these are the issues of children&rsquo;s rights, the best interest of the child, the power of the State to intervene in the family and adoption.  Again, an extraordinary amount of work, research, hearing of evidence and consideration of submissions informed the detailed debate that shaped the ultimate recommendations of the committee.</P>
        <P>It was our shared view from an early stage that the published 2007 Bill did not go far enough to achieve the aim of enhancing children&rsquo;s rights.  From an early stage of our deliberations, all members of the committee from all shades of opinion and all parties, grappled to see if we could shape a wording that could be agreed and which would advance children&rsquo;s rights in a groundbreaking fashion.  It is a remarkable achievement to have produced in February of this year, some three months ago, an all-party agreed set of proposals, including an agreed wording for constitutional change.  Many times during the committee deliberations I did not think we would reach that momentous moment but we did.</P>
        <P>This report followed what was probably the most comprehensive examination of the truly complex issues involved in trying to enshrine and enhance the protection of the rights of children.  I pay tribute, as I did on its publication, to all members of the committee who worked under the able chairmanship of Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke in a non-partisan way to address the complicated and delicate issues.  The final report enjoyed the support of all members, representing every Oireachtas party.  We also benefited from the participation of the Government through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews.  For that reason, one <Col N="275"/>could hope and expect a speedy response to the committee&rsquo;s groundbreaking proposals.  Clearly, we are all agreed that few issues better demand our attention and action.  Unlike most committee work, nothing new was presented to the Government three months ago.  It has been fully engaged with the arguments, genesis and conclusions.  The parties that constitute the Government signed up to those proposals.</P>
        <P>This motion, sponsored by the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, seeks to move the process along.  It needs to be moved along urgently.  We have waited long enough for this change.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann must again unite on this issue and remain united, endorse the draft wording for constitutional change recommended unanimously by the committee and announce our determination to bring this proposal to the people this year.</P>
        <P>It is said by some that the Government will not agree to a referendum this year for fear of needing to hold the by-elections that are due.  That cannot be tolerated as an excuse for inaction on this issue.  The welfare of children and the failure of State, church and society to give them adequate protection have convulsed this House and the nation.  Our words of determination to do better, which followed every report and debate in the House, and to act decisively in the interest of children will ring hollow indeed if we long-finger this much needed change.  This proposal will require detailed explanation, debate and engagement with the people.  That will require time.  The sooner we complete the legislative phase of the constitutional amendment Bill, the sooner we can start the process of real engagement and dialogue with the electorate we must persuade to pass it.</P>
        <P>There have been a few voices of concern.  Any change gives rise to proper questioning.  We need to know the Government&rsquo;s intention now so that fears are not fanned by the vacuum of inaction.  In short, we need to start a detailed process of communication with the electorate.</P>
        <P>What is recommended in the words proposed?  We recommend a new Article 42 to be entitled, &ldquo;Children&rdquo;.  This new article sets out the recognition of equality between all children, with no inequalities before the law between the children of married parents and the children of unmarried parents, the recognition of children&rsquo;s natural and imprescriptible rights vested in themselves, their right to have their welfare regarded as either a primary or paramount consideration, their right to protection and care and the right of the child&rsquo;s voice to be heard.  It acknowledges parents as the primary and natural carers, educators and protectors of the welfare of their children and guarantees to respect these rights and responsibilities.  It would allow the State, where parents fail in their responsibilities, to supply or supplement the place of the parents by proportionate means.  It would provide for adoption of children where their best interests so require.  It re-enacts the existing provisions dealing with the rights of parents to provide for the education of their children.</P>
        <P>These and the other recommendations in the 117 pages of the report can make a real and historic difference, but only if they are acted upon.  Too many sad, depressing, horrific reports on the abuse of children have been laid before the House.  Just as we united in expressions of outrage when we read of the abuse of children, let us unite in our determination to make things better in a concrete fashion.  The committee did not divide on party political lines, so let us not divide now.  The proof of our sincerity on these issues will be provided in our deeds, not our words.</P>
        <P>I am profoundly disappointed to read the amendment proposed by the Government.  I believe in the goodwill and determination of the Minister of State with responsibility for children to bring about real change, but he must be supported by the House and he must demand the action of the Cabinet.  Pass this motion tomorrow evening and let us show a common determination to act on this issue for the common good of all, particularly the children of this country.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="276"/>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my condolences to the family of Daniel McAnaspie.  Like others, I met his family members on the street outside Leinster House when they were exhausted from searching for him.  We should all be conscious that he was one of 20 children who died in the care of the HSE.  This makes our meaning clear when we discuss protecting children under the Constitution.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate, if not poignant, that the Deputy presenting the motion is Deputy Howlin, who was the Minister for Health in 1993 when Mrs Justice Catherine McGuinness presented her groundbreaking report, which proposed a constitutional amendment.  It is worth reminding the House that, before and after 1993, there have been three referendums on the rights of the unborn child.  This country has been convulsed by debates on zygotes, the morning after pill and the pregnancies of poor, young, tragic girls.  We have had that debate three times, but we have never had a constitutional referendum on the rights of born children, children who are a part of our community and are at risk from whatever quarter.  That is negligence.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to step outside the box and consider what is occurring tonight.  We have an opportunity to live up to the recommendations and words of his predecessor, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who stated in 2007 that the time for oratory was over and that we needed to present the people with a constitutional amendment on which they could vote.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I compliment the committee, which invested superhuman effort to deliver for the Oireachtas and the people an amendment that captured all of the complex issues relating to the protection of children.  Its members have done the country a great service.  Across the Chamber, it is our turn.  We cannot do it solely as members of the Opposition and I welcome that this is a joint Private Members&rsquo; motion.  We should not make a political football out of the matter and no one wants to, but is it the case that the Government is so sclerosed or scared that it cannot agree?  Consider the prize.  If the motion was agreed across all parties, consider the strength it would give to the commitment to protect children in 2010.  We could go to the people and convince them of how important it is that we have all come together to ensure the committee&rsquo;s work is not put away for another day and is, instead, acted upon.</P>
        <P>We must take the initiative and ensure a debate on the rights of children in our communities who are at risk as we speak, often within their families.  There is much discussion on church and State involvement in brutality and barbarism, but the greatest area of danger for many children is within their families.  This is our chance to help them and I urge the Government to move beyond party political point-scoring.  It should take on board the genuine intent of presenting the people with an amendment that could make a significant difference to the safety of our children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I begin by extending my deepest sympathy and that of my party to the family of Daniel McAnaspie.  The family endured a terrible ordeal during the weeks Daniel was missing and has now been visited by the worst ordeal of all as they prepare to lay to rest this boy whose life was destroyed before he had the opportunity to begin that life.  We will never know the terrible ordeal suffered by Daniel.  What we do know is that he fell into the hands of murderers when he was supposed to be in the care of the State.  </P>
        <P>Daniel McAnaspie was under the care of the Health Service Executive.  His death brings to 24 the official number of children in State care who have died in recent years.  It is impossible to say how many of these deaths were avoidable had the State cared better for the children under its direct responsibility.  We need to know as much as possible about every such tragedy.  Therefore, the reports on each should be published so that the facts can be made clear, lessons can be learned and the systems and practises can be put in place to try to prevent any more avoidable tragedies.</P><Col N="277"/>
        <P>I support of the call of the McAnaspie family for a public inquiry.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must pursue Daniel McAnaspie&rsquo;s murderers with determination.  I urge anyone with information to bring it to the Garda without delay.  Parallel with this must be a full and public investigation of how the State and all its agencies dealt with Daniel, the results of which must be published in full.  The death of Daniel McAnaspie overshadows and adds poignancy to this debate this evening on the rights of children in the Constitution.  It reminds us that this is not an abstract debate of interest only to legislators and lawyers; it is a life and death issue today.  It is about the protection of children in Ireland today, tomorrow and into the future.  That protection and their rights need to be fully vindicated in the Constitution, in legislation and in the provision of services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It should not have been necessary to bring forward this Private Members&rsquo; motion at this time.  Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party have done so out of concern at the failure of the Government to give a firm commitment to hold a referendum to strengthen the rights of children in the Constitution.  We have in recent weeks repeatedly asked the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste if and when a referendum Bill will be published; if and when the Government will agree the wording of the amendment and if and when the Cabinet will fully discuss the matter.  Their answers have been evasive and minimalist and give rise to concern that this vital issue is being sidelined for reasons of political expediency.</P>
        <P>I regret to say that the self-congratulatory amendment tabled by the Government only adds to our serious concern.  Incredibly, it recognises the work of the Government in the first and second interim reports of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, which committee was an all-party committee that reached all-party agreement on a range of difficult and complex issues, including the referendum wording.  The Government amendment was either hastily and sloppily drafted or is a calculated snub to the other party representatives on the committee.  Either way it is a bad piece of work.  This is underscored by the fact that the Government has been forced to substitute the original wording by now congratulating itself on its progress in implementing the recommendations in the first and second reports.  The changed wording is just as incredible as was the first because we have yet to even see sight of the proposed legislation to give effect to the recommendations in the first report of the committee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The final report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children was published and given to Government in February, some three months ago.  There has been more than enough time for the Government to consult with all the relevant Departments and the Attorney General and to bring forward a Bill to hold a constitutional referendum on this matter.  All that is lacking is the political will from Government to do so.  The parties represented on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children came to a consensus on the wording after 62 long and often difficult meetings.  The Government has on repeated occasions acknowledged the need for a referendum.  This Private Members&rsquo; business is not about why we need a referendum.  The Members of the D&aacute;il have discussed this on many occasions and have all accepted this.  This debate is about why this referendum needs to be held as a matter of urgency, which is clearly the gulf between Government and the Opposition Members tabling this motion this evening.  This is in our opinion a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>The onus is now on the Government to publish without delay a Bill to provide for the necessary constitutional amendment Bill and to set the date for the holding of this referendum in 2010.  This Private Members&rsquo; motion is timely following the publication by Ms Emily Logan, the Ombudsman for Children, of the report on the implementation of the Children First guidelines, a source of serious concern.  The Ombudsman for Children identified major gaps in the implementation of the Children First guidelines which are in theory designed to help protect <Col N="278"/>children by ensuring vigilance and competence on the part of the State bodies, including the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is clear from the report of the Ombudsman for Children that since its establishment in 2005 the HSE has failed to make sufficient efforts to drive forward the implementation of Children First.  The most basic of child protection procedures have not been adhered to.  For example, the HSE has completely failed to ensure, across the HSE, consistent definitions of abuse and has failed to provide clarity and consistency regarding the reporting of child abuse concerns.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs is found by the Ombudsman for Children to have played down the impact on implementation of Children First of ongoing industrial relations problems.  This is a serious charge that the Minister and trade unions need to address.  It is clear that Government cannot afford to put off this matter any longer.  The legislation and current legal framework does not adequately protect children.  Many Members on the Government side have acknowledged this and so questions such as why we are still waiting for a referendum Bill to be published must be asked.</P>
        <P>The HSE is rife with problems in regard to how it manages children in its care.  We recently learned that lying on shelves in the HSE are 20 reports on the deaths of children in State care which are awaiting publication.  No valid excuse has been given by the HSE for the delay.  These should have been forwarded to the Ombudsman for Children, the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is possible that some people involved were criminally negligent in carrying out their duties to the children in their care.  I would not be surprised, were we ever to see sight of the content of these reports, if the Garda did not believe there were grounds for investigation in regard to at least one of them.</P>
        <P>The State has failed in its obligations to its children.  This is a long-term problem that is evident in the systemic failure testified in the Ryan report and in other inquiries into residential care institutions throughout the years, as well as in more recent damning reports that have scandalised residential centres, such as the Ballydowd centre in west Dublin, which was closed on foot of a Health Information and Quality Authority report, after having had &euro;13 million put into it by the State.</P>
        <P>There is a systemic failure in the child protection sector.  Children are placed in inappropriate accommodation and are fostered out with no sign of a social worker for years on end.  In some cases, children are exported to residential centres overseas at the cost of millions because the State refuses to invest in the facilities necessary to treat children who have severe behavioural difficulties or who have suffered major trauma or abuse in their lives.  This constitutes a further example of the State washing its hands.  It once did so in respect of the religious institutions and now it is in respect of every other mess into which the State can place children for whom it is not prepared to provide the necessary supports, resources, backup or care.  This is a damning indictment of successive governments and such practices must end this year.  How many times have Members asked about the position regarding the vetting of those who work with children?  While a national vetting Bill and a new criminal justice (sexual offences) Bill have been promised, there is no sign of either.  Moreover, there are insufficient social workers, other front-line workers and support systems.  Children are left in grave danger.  Cutbacks and under-resourcing have meant there are insufficient staff members to cover the number of children they must protect.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for children has given no adequate explanation as to the reason the next State report on the Government&rsquo;s progress in implementing the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is now a year late.  This simply is another example of tardiness with regard to children&rsquo;s rights and another reason this referendum must be held as a matter of urgency.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who has the <Col N="279"/>ultimate responsibility and who of course once again is absent, and the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, who has direct responsibility, have never explained in detail the reason children so often have been and continue to be let down by the State.  The Taoiseach has not told Members the reason that even though the final report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children has been laid before the D&aacute;il, the Government has not published a constitutional amendment Bill, although he has been pressed on this matter repeatedly in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>The absence of legislation to place the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing continues to leave children vulnerable to abuse and neglect.  This point has been upheld by the recent reports from the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, and the special rapporteur on children&rsquo;s rights, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon.  Holding a referendum will not on its own be the complete answer for children&rsquo;s rights on this island.  As I noted earlier, the Children First guidelines must be placed on a statutory footing and child protection services must be resourced, in addition to adequate provision of resources in the education and health systems.</P>
        <P>The lack of robust constitutional rights for children has left a position in which successive Governments have been able to wash their hands of their responsibilities.  The existing legislation in place is not enough to hold the Government to account.  There is no general obligation to carry out child proofing of laws concerning children and nor is there a requirement on the Government to ensure there are adequate administrative and political structures or laws and policies to uphold children&rsquo;s rights.  This referendum is needed this year both because children deserve to have their rights as individuals acknowledged and because governments cannot be trusted to uphold children&rsquo;s rights without a stronger constitutional obligation.</P>
        <P>Enshrining children&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution will not be the magical cure for the ills of the child protection system but it will put a great deal of pressure on the Government and on all State agencies to honour their commitments and obligations to the children of Ireland.  Consequently, together with my colleagues on the Sinn F&eacute;in benches, with the Labour Party Members and with Deputy Howlin, who also was a member of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, I call on the Minister of State to withdraw his amendment or to confirm that the Government will hold this referendum this year.  The Minister of State should either withdraw his amendment and accept the motion tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party or should make it crystal clear for all to understand that the Government will proceed with the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights in the year 2010.</P>
        <P>This is what Members have been asking for all along.  There are no other side issues or distractions.  It is critically focused, and places children first and foremost in one&rsquo;s concerns.  Moreover, Members&rsquo; bona fides in this regard are as long and well-established as are those of the Minister of State and his predecessors as Ministers of State with responsibility for children in their respective roles and contributions to the long deliberations of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, which was chaired by the former Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke.  I call on the Minister of State to not disappoint the House and to not disappoint the many people who are anxious and concerned to have clarity on the Government&rsquo;s intent this evening.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">To delete all words after &ldquo;children;&rdquo; in the third paragraph and substitute the following:</P><Col N="280"/>
        <P LI="3" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p2" />&ldquo;&mdash;<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />acknowledges the commitment in the renewed programme for Government 2009 to proceed, subject to appropriate Oireachtas approval, with proposals to hold a constitutional referendum to consider children&rsquo;s rights, based on the work of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children;</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges the need to undertake a comprehensive examination of the policy implications of draft wording for a proposed constitutional amendment, contained in the report of the Committee.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss the work of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  The aim of the proposed amendment of the Constitution is to improve the underpinning of children&rsquo;s rights in Ireland.  During the debate on the joint committee&rsquo;s third and final report in the House some weeks ago, there were plaudits for the Chair and members of the committee for the work completed.  I join with previous speakers in once again putting on the record of the D&aacute;il my appreciation for the work of the committee.  In dealing specifically with the issue of children&rsquo;s rights, the committee met 62 times and spent eight months before February deliberating on the matters at hand this evening.  The committee&rsquo;s final report came after five extensions to its time schedule.  I point to the extensions not as a veiled criticism but as evidence of the complexity of the subject being examined.</P>
        <P>The text of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann makes very few references to the child as a specific constitutional actor.  Children can, however, rely on the general protective provisions of the Constitution, such as, for example those contained in Article 40 and those identified by judicial interpretation.  The Supreme Court held in re Article 26 and the Adoption (No. 2) Bill 1987, that a child is entitled, where appropriate, to invoke Articles 40 to 44.  It stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The rights of a child who is a member of a family are not confined to those identified in Articles 41 and 42 but are also rights referred to in Articles 40, 43 and 44.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Furthermore, the courts have, in some cases, defined the personal rights guarantee in Article 40.3 in ways that arguably are specific to the child.  For example, the then Chief Justice O&rsquo;Higgins in G. <i>v</i>. An Bord Ucht&aacute;la found that Article 40.3 provided that:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The child has the right to be fed and to live, to be reared and educated, to have the opportunity of working and of realising his or her full personality and dignity as a human being.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">However, for more than 20 years, eminent legal and child protection experts have argued for the need to amend the Constitution to incorporate a specific provision in respect of children&rsquo;s rights.  It is worth recalling that this argument has been under way for 20 years and not merely since February 2010.  It has been stated that the Constitution should incorporate a list of expressed rights for children to remove the element of uncertainty which may currently exist.</P>
        <P>International bodies, including the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, echoed the calls for constitutional change.  In September 2006, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its concluding observations on Ireland&rsquo;s second report on the convention, raised <Col N="281"/>again the need for reform in this area.  It should be noted that Article 5 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">State Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents... to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognised in the present Convention.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The 2002-07 programme for Government contained a commitment that family rights and related issues would be referred to an all-party committee on the Constitution.  That committee reported in 2006, recommending an amendment to Article 41 to include a new section on the rights of children.  In 1996, the Constitution review group made a recommendation for changed wording in respect of children.</P>
        <P>Following that recommendation, my predecessor as Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, undertook an article by article review of the Constitution to examine the status of children.  That review, which included wide consultation, resulted in the publication of the Twenty-Eighth Amendment to the Constitution Bill in February 2007.  It sought to enshrine in the Constitution rights that would accrue to children as a distinct group and not simply as human beings and individuals or members of a family unit.</P>
        <P>In publishing that Bill, the Government aimed to provide a clear statement of the rights of children, while continuing the constitutional presumption that the best interests of children are served within the family.  The proposals in the Bill also dealt with the issue of intervention of the State in the family under Article 42.5 and with adoption of marital children and of children in care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issues that the Bill dealt with are complex and were recognised as potentially contentious.  It was recognised that if a referendum was to be passed, political consensus would be key.  For that reason in November, 2007 the joint committee was established, with the task of examining the proposals contained in the Bill with a view to deepening consensus on this matter.  By doing so, the Government acknowledged the February 2007 wording needed to be improved.</P>
        <P>In its work over the past two years, the committee adopted a very constructive approach to the very complicated and sensitive issues under consideration.  Great weight was given to the expert opinion presented to the committee and the legal advice that was on hand to guide its work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The committee first examined the issue of &ldquo;soft information&rdquo; and subsequently the consequences of the CC case in the context of &ldquo;strict&rdquo; versus &ldquo;absolute liability&rdquo;.  There was unanimous agreement that &ldquo;soft information&rdquo; could be provided for by legislation.  A majority of the committee decided that &ldquo;absolute liability&rdquo; should not be reinstated in respect of defilement-statutory rape cases and that therefore a referendum was not necessary on this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although the legislation has not yet been presented in respect of the two previous reports, considerable progress has been made in developing Bills.  The national vetting bureau Bill will provide for the establishment of a national vetting bureau for the collection and exchange of both &ldquo;hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; information for vetting purposes.  This legislation has been given Government priority and my office, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is drafting the heads of the Bill for submission to Government at the earliest possible date.  I reject the contention that we have been tardy in bringing forward this; it is complex legislation and significant progress has been made to ensure different Departments are in agreement about how to proceed with it.  It is some time since the unanimous agreement on the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; information recommendation by the committee but substantial progress has been made and I hope to have published legislation in due course.</P><Col N="282"/>
        <P>As regards the recommendations in the committee&rsquo;s second report, including recommendations relating to age of consent and defences available to defendants, the heads of a Bill are being prepared in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law reform.  The Bill will also provide for reform of the laws on incest.  A general scheme of the Bill has been presented to Government and has been approved.</P>
        <P>The committee faced a challenge to balance the rights of families, children, marital and non marital parents.  It became obvious through members&rsquo; contributions and the expert opinion provided to the committee that the original 2007 Bill did not contain the potential to effect the desired level of change.  The committee&rsquo;s report, which is extremely detailed, carefully and thoroughly examines the proposals contained in the original Bill.  As an alternative to the wording contained in that Bill, the report recommends inserting a new Article 42 into the Constitution, restating most of the education provisions, but adding several new sections and renaming the section &ldquo;Children&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Education&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The new section begins with the phrase that &ldquo;the State shall cherish all the children of the State equally&rdquo;.  In this case, the phrase is being used to refer to children, although as Mr. Justice Adrian Hardiman recently pointed out, that was not the case in the 1916 Proclamation, from which it is a quotation.  Mr. Justice Hardiman stated that the reference to children in the Proclamation related to minority groups and not the literal understanding of children as we may read it.</P>
        <P>The proposed Article 42.1.2 provides specifically that children have specific human rights and that the State has a duty to vindicate the rights of children.  The provision reads:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The State recognises and acknowledges the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children including their right to have their welfare regarded as a primary consideration and shall, as far as practicable, protect and vindicate those rights.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">While the concept of the welfare of children is enshrined in some legislation, its use in the proposed Article 42.1 would ensure that children&rsquo;s welfare would be the paramount consideration in a range of areas affecting children.  This will strengthen a more child-centred approach in family law decision making, including in areas such as guardianship, adoption, custody, care or the upbringing of a child.  This proposal is not limited to judicial proceedings but extends to &ldquo;the resolution of all disputes&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The proposals in Article 42.2 would require the State to recognise and vindicate the rights of all children as individuals, as opposed to children within the family.  It also proposes that a child&rsquo;s voice should be heard in any matter affecting the child, with due regard for the age of the child.  The rights in this part of the proposal are from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The committee made a specific decision not to recommend incorporating the full text of the convention in the Constitution.</P>
        <P>The proposed Article 42.4 deals with what is for many people the most contentious part of the proposals.  The primacy of the family is very important to Irish people, and there has been concern that by giving rights to children as individuals, rights are taken away from the family.  However, it should be emphasised that neither the 2007 Bill nor the committee&rsquo;s proposal are attempting to reduce family rights in any way.  It is widely accepted that the best interests of the child are served by being part of a stable family unit.  As I said, the proposal will not challenge or amend the concept of the family founded in marriage as the &ldquo;natural, primary and fundamental unit group of Society&rdquo;, as outlined in Article 41.1.1.  It is important to highlight this in the context of any referendum campaign that will follow.</P><Col N="283"/>
        <P>The proposals would promote early intervention and support for families in difficulties, thus reducing the possibility of children being taken into the care of the State.  Some parents for a range of reasons cannot care for a child properly and intervention by the State, up to and including removal of the child from their home, can be necessary.  However, under this proposal, removal of children from their family home will continue to be a last resort.</P>
        <P>A strong feature of the debate in the committee focused on the principle of proportionality and there was recognition that any intervention in the family must be proportionate.  As a general principle of law, proportionality involves establishing a balance between competing claims.  It requires that any action undertaken must be proportionate to its objectives and must not infringe a basic right to a greater extent than is necessary.  The principle of proportionality is now generally assumed to be implicit in Irish constitutional interpretation and there is a developing jurisprudence on the subject.  However, the insertion of proportionality provides assurances that intervention will only occur as a measure of last resort.</P>
        <P>In this particular context, the principle of proportionality demands that the action taken will constitute the minimum intervention to secure the child&rsquo;s welfare and safety and one that will interfere least with the right to family life.  It must represent a balanced response to the need to safeguard the child and the State must endeavour to prevent the separation of children from their families unless remaining in the family would endanger the child&rsquo;s development and well-being.  This means that all alternatives should be fully considered and the courts must be satisfied that no less radical measure will achieve the necessary end of protecting the child.  Hence, the principle of proportionality should ensure that pursuing a care order is a measure of last resort and it is unlikely to result in greater numbers of children being taken into care; rather it should help to establish a more uniform standard of care.</P>
        <P>The object of the adoption clause is to address the position of children who have been in care under court order for a significant period of their lives.  This wording, along with the underpinning legislation, will permit children to be adopted if it is in their best interests.  For such children, where a return to their birth families is not an option, the possibility of adoption represents a second chance for a stable and secure family life.</P>
        <P>Until 1988, only the children of unmarried parents who, by virtue of their parents&rsquo; non-marital status, fell outside the scope of Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution, could be legally adopted.  The view was taken that the irrevocable nature of an adoption order was incompatible with the inalienable nature of the family&rsquo;s rights under Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution.  The 1988 Act dictates that adoption can occur only where the court is satisfied that there has been parental failure in their duty towards the child for physical or moral reasons for the previous 12 months, that the failure is likely to continue without interruption until the child reaches 18 years, and that the failure constitutes an abandonment of all constitutional rights on the part of the parents.  The result is that, to date, the availability of adoption to children of marriage has been severely circumscribed.  In some cases, children are taken into care at birth and raised by foster parents, with their birth parents contacting them or expressing an interest in contacting them only sporadically.  Applications to adopt such children have failed based on the current interpretation of Article 42.5 because the best interests of the child cannot be considered since abandonment is not judged to constitute failure unless it continues without interruption until the child is 18.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The requirement that a failure constitutes abandonment creates the possibility that even in situations where a total failure of parental duty has been established, the requirement of abandonment might not be satisfied.  The absence of a definition of abandonment has resulted in a situation in which there is a strong possibility that individual children will find themselves trapped in a legal limbo between intervention and adoption and in which the State will be able <Col N="284"/>to remove them from their parents in the interests of their welfare, but are unable to have them adopted by another appropriate family.</P>
        <P>The intention of this proposal is to allow the adoption of children where there has been a failure of duty for such a period as prescribed by law and where the best interests of the child so require.  A legislative provision would have to be introduced to provide for a definition of the term &ldquo;abandonment&rdquo;, and to provide a definition for the specified period of time.</P>
        <P>This provision should not significantly alter the threshold for State intervention as outlined in Article 42.4.  However, it does recalibrate the test for parental failure with regard to adoption.  This provision will not result in more children entering State care.  However, it will result in an increase in the number of children in long-term care being adopted.  The Government will ensure that legislation on this issue will be published before any referendum, so that people will be clear about the scope and intent of the proposal, as recommended by the committee.</P>
        <P>In coming to its conclusions, the committee forensically examined the proposals contained in the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2007 and a range of other suggestions that emerged during its deliberations.  Given the far-reaching and important nature of the proposals, the Government will have to give at least the same level of attention to a forensic parsing of the wording.  It is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that the wording does not have unintended and unwanted consequences.  These proposals represent a sizeable change to the Constitution.  They relate to eight sub-articles, some of which are restatements of existing provisions, but many introduce new concepts and new wording.</P>
        <P>All of the comments made have been on child protection, yet the provisions proposed by the committee would deal with matters to do with education, juvenile justice, every aspect of health care, immigration policy and adoption.  I understand the focus of the House on child protection and I share very much in the expressions of sorrow and regret about the tragedy that befell Daniel McAnaspie.  I extend my regrets to his family and friends.</P>
        <P>However, there is a much wider context and we must have that wider debate.  While the committee considered all of these matters in some detail, it is quite different for an Oireachtas committee to consider a matter than for 15 Departments and the Office of the Attorney General to consider it.  I believe we are much closer to having a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights than we have been at any time in the past 20 years.  I stated that in the House three weeks ago and I repeat it today.</P>
        <P>These proposals represent a sizeable change to the Constitution.  The committee took legal advice and the Government will, of course, also have to consult with its legal advisers and will have to act based on that legal advice.  Clearly, in a matter as important as the Constitution, the Government cannot simply accept the wording &mdash; the potential consequences have to be considered.  The Government accords considerable importance to the consensus reached by the committee and will not set out to unpick the proposed wording.  If any changes are made to the wording, it will be to avoid unwanted and unintended consequences or to ensure that the wording achieves its aim.</P>
        <P>It is not a criticism but a statement of fact that the committee took two years and three months to reach its conclusions.  The Government is not asking, nor suggesting, that such time is required to come to a conclusion.  However, it is important to complete our work in a thorough fashion.  The Government does not want to recommend amending the Constitution by way of a Bill that is flawed or may have unintended consequences.  Deputy Howlin mentioned that I was a member of the committee.  I contributed as much as I could to the committee but the wording was not finalised until towards the end of the committee&rsquo;s deliberations and due diligence requires that each Department which could be affected by the proposed wording <Col N="285"/>gives it due consideration.  When one considers that proposals have been coming forward since 1993, the time allowed since February is quite short.</P>
        <P>Having urged caution, I am not suggesting that this be put on the long finger &mdash; far from it.  When the report was brought to the Government in March, the Cabinet decided that in view of the complex nature of the issues involved, all Ministers and Departments should consider the report and examine the implications of the proposed wording for their individual areas of responsibility.  Departments are also to consider what legislation would need to be put in place in advance of any referendum.  The matter was therefore referred to the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion to carry out this work and report back to the Government.  A senior officials group working to the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion has been reconvened to guide the interaction and co-ordinate the responses of all Departments.  This group has met once, and will meet again before the end of the month.  I spoke to the first meeting of this group and emphasised the importance of moving ahead quickly.</P>
        <P>The Attorney General has also been considering the legal and constitutional ramifications of the report.  His input will be critical in terms of deciding on future action.  I can assure the House that I will continue to work to bring forward a new referendum Bill, which will be based on the consensus achieved by the committee, and to do so as soon as possible.  The intention is that in early summer the report will be brought back to Government with an analysis of what needs to be done and how long it will take.  As I have said, it took the committee more than two years to get to this point.  Any proposed amendment to the Constitution must be done properly and given the particularly complex nature of the issues in this proposal, thorough consideration of all of the details is the least that one should expect of the Government before it can be put to the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be given the opportunity to speak on the extremely important issue of the constitutional referendum on children.  The Government is committed to continuing to improve child welfare and protection in Ireland and sees a constitutional amendment as a key part of that improvement.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that the provision of appropriate robust and responsive child welfare and protection services remains a key priority for the Government.  Child welfare and protection services have come a long way, although there is still considerable progress to be made.  There is a strong legislative and policy framework, which needs to be implemented in a co-ordinated way for the benefit of all vulnerable children.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has provided a cross-cutting structure that helps to promote a shared emphasis on improving children&rsquo;s lives in this country.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, will continue to ensure that the various agencies and Departments work together in a co-ordinated way to improve outcomes for children in Ireland.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Moving on to the referendum proposals, I congratulate the committee for its work.  The fact that the committee recommended legislative solutions to two of the issues under consideration, namely, soft information and absolute and strict liability, was a very significant achievement, allowing us to deal with these difficult issues effectively.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are in the process of bringing forward legislation in respect of the first two reports of the committee, which dealt with these two issues.  This legislation is being given priority by the Government.</P>
      <P>With regard to the third and final report of the committee, the fact that the committee took eight months to produce its report, met on more than 62 occasions and received and dealt with 175 submissions gives some sense of the complexity of the issues being considered.  I again express my admiration for the work done in this regard.  Of particular importance, as the <Col N="286"/>Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, has already said, is the fact that the committee achieved cross-party consensus on such a complex range of issues.  Many of the difficulties being addressed are contentious, which makes reaching consensus an even more impressive achievement of the committee.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, has dealt in some detail with the committee&rsquo;s proposals.  I will refer to just some of the key points.  The committee considered that the present constitutional framework in certain cases creates a difference in treatment between children of marital and non-marital families.</P>
        <P>The committee was also concerned that where a family was found to be experiencing difficulties in the care and upbringing of their children there should be proportionate intervention by way of assistance and support; that only in cases where there is a genuine threat to a child&rsquo;s safety or welfare should the courts or the State be entitled to intervene; and that such intervention should be proportionate.</P>
        <P>The committee considered that there should be specific rights attributed to children in the Constitution including the right to such protection and care as is necessary for his or her safety and welfare; the right to an education; and the right to have his or her voice heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child having regard to his or her maturity.</P>
      
        <P>With regard to adoption, the committee took the view that the proposals set out in the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill were helpful.  It voiced its concern that children who are currently in long-term foster care may be precluded from adoption by their foster family where it would be in the best interest of the child to be adopted.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, presented a copy of the committee&rsquo;s third report to the Cabinet in March.  Ministers were asked to consider the content of the report and revert with opinions and comments on the various recommendations.  The Attorney General has been asked to examine the constitutional ramifications arising from the proposals contained in the report.  There have been calls to commit immediately to a timeframe for a referendum.  I remind all interested parties that the committee took over two years to get to its current position.  The Government will need some time to consider the full import of the proposal before committing to any timeframe.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, referred to the issue of potential unintended consequences arising from the wording of the referendum proposal.  The Government, in putting forward a referendum to the people, needs to be absolutely clear on what are the implications of the proposal.  The committee examined the issues forensically and over time, and the Government will give the proposals equally thorough consideration.</P>
        <P>Much work is still required before this referendum will be ready to present to the people.  Elements of the referendum, for example, those related to adoption, require legislation to be drafted prior to the holding of a referendum and to be available well in advance in order that people can clearly understand the implications of the proposals.  Other aspects of the proposed wording may also require draft legislation and the Attorney General will be advising in this regard.  The issues are complex and it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to ensure that clear and intelligible information is provided to the public in a timely manner.</P>
        <P>All of these elements of the staging of a referendum will require time and planning.  Any amendment to the Constitution is a major endeavour.  In this case, where the issues are so complex, it is essential that the Government take the time to get it right.  Until it is clear what, if any, issues need to be addressed, it would be foolhardy and premature to announce a date for a referendum.  The Government is taking this seriously and will not pick a date for the sake <Col N="287"/>of it.  When this referendum is brought to the people, it will have been properly considered and all the issues dealt with.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to start off this debate, like other speakers, by extending my condolences to the family of Daniel McAnaspie.  I met his family some weeks ago.  They were terribly concerned about what had happened to him and dreadfully distressed about the manner in which they believed he had been failed and the family had been failed by the HSE.  It is particularly sad and poignant that this motion is being taken this evening at a time when his remains have been found, essentially in a ditch on farmland in County Meath, and before he is buried.  </P>
        <P>I also think it is particularly inappropriate and obscene that in the Government amendment tabled tonight the Government congratulates itself on the manner in which it has essentially implemented our child care provisions.  I quote from the Government amendment, which states that it &ldquo;commends the Government for prioritising the promotion and protection of the welfare and the rights of children&rdquo;.  I believe, in the context of everything we have learned following the publication of the reports into the tragic lives of Tracey Fay and David Foley and the large number of young people who have died in care about whom reports have not yet been published, the numbers of whom I now believe to be greater than the 23 numbered by the Minister some weeks ago in this House, that it is an obscenity that the Government felt the need to commend itself in this way.</P>
        <P>Not only is it an obscenity, it is politically indefensible in the context not only of the tragic death of Daniel McAnaspie, but in the context of the damning report of the Ombudsman for Children which made two findings of maladministration or unsound administration against the Office of the Minister for Health and Children and nine such findings against the HSE with regard to the utter failure to ensure that the 1999 child protection guidelines be uniformly applied throughout the State.  At the very least, I would have expected the Government and the Minister to have sufficient insight not to include that in their motion.</P>
        <P>I do welcome the fact that we have this motion, in the sense that it yet again brings the need for a children&rsquo;s referendum before the House.  I regret that it has been necessary for it to be tabled.  Indeed, I would say that I expected, following the work we did in our all-party committee, that within a short period of time the Government would have named a date for the holding of the referendum for the simple reason that this committee was formed to facilitate an accommodation being reached between Government and Opposition parties.  Both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Health and Children, and their predecessors, were members of the committee so that they could liaise with Government, with Cabinet and with the Attorney General concerning the deliberations of the committee, the progress being made and the nature of agreements being reached.</P><Col N="288"/>
        <P>Indeed, I can well recall the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, coming back to the committee and it affording him extra time because, during the course of our deliberations on the form of constitutional amendment to propose, he was consulting with and obtaining advices from the Attorney General, so I take less than seriously what we are now being told about the complexities of it.</P>
        <P>I want to say one other thing about the motion that is before the House for fear there is any misunderstanding outside the House.  It may not generally be understood outside the House that the entitlement of parties in this House to propose motions rotates.  Fine Gael has an entitlement to propose Private Members&rsquo; motions.  The Labour Party, on a separate occasion, proposes motions.  On other occasions, the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in join together to propose motions.  Tonight happens to be one of those nights.  I want to say, on behalf of Fine Gael, had we been invited to sign tonight&rsquo;s motion by the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in, we would have done so.  I regret the fact that we were not asked to do so.  I am assuming that was simply an oversight by the coincidence of the rotation of these things, but we would have been very happy to sign the motion that is before the House.  This motion has the full support of Fine Gael.</P>
        <P>For many years I campaigned, both inside and outside this House, for a constitutional referendum in relation to children.  I believe that the form of wording we now have which was proposed by the committee, in respect of which I burned the midnight oil many evenings to try to see could I contribute in a constructive manner, together with my Fine Gael colleagues, to bring about a form of wording on which we were all agreed, is the best possible wording.  Not only have we achieved a political consensus, we have achieved a form of wording which reflects our obligations under the United Nations convention on the rights of the child and which extends to children far greater constitutional protection than they have at present.</P>
        <P>It does something which we have not done appropriately yet in our Constitution.  It recognises the primacy and the importance of the family and, indeed, of parents with regard to their children while recognising the importance, where families are in difficulties, of the State proportionately intervening within the family.  In a constitutional sense, at the moment the State has two choices.  One either stands aside and allows a child at risk essentially to remain at risk or take what I describe as a &ldquo;nuclear option&rdquo; and move to have a child taken into care.  There are provisions within our child care legislation at present, for example, for the making of supervision orders, which in the constitution of the marital family may have some questionable constitutional content.</P>
        <P>What this proposal does is seek to ensure that we protect the rights of parents while also protecting the best interest of children and ensuring that where children are at risk, there is a proportionate intervention permitted and allowed for and mandated by our fundamental constitutional law.  I believe there is an urgent need to prioritise this reform.</P>
        <P>I do not take seriously what the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, tells us about all of the deliberations that need to take place and the length of time that this is all going to take.  I am a Member of this House who watched within a space of a short few months the Government managing to create and pass through this House the NAMA legislation &mdash; one of the most detailed, complex pieces of legislation I have ever seen in my parliamentary life.  Legislation which has profound consequences in the financial area was given priority.  No such priority is being afforded to the protection of children, despite all the scandals, the failings of the church and the failings of the State, as clearly documented over the past decade.  I find it extraordinary that priority is not yet being extended.  The Government pays lip service to the protection of children and the rights of children but fails to deliver when delivery is required.</P><Col N="289"/>
        <P>I was most interested in listening to the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews and to the Minister of State, Deputy White, to whom I will revert in a moment, address us on the first and second interim reports.  Deputy Andrews told us, misleadingly, that the Government is prioritising legislation on using soft information for vetting purposes.  The first report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children published in September 2008 asked the Government, across party lines, to publish that legislation by December 2008.  That legislation is not being prioritised.</P>

	<P>It is not in the programme for Government for legislation to be published this side of the summer vacation, nor is it in the programme that guarantees legislation will be published the far side of the summer vacation.  For those who understand the documents published by the Government Chief Whip, it is in part 3 of the legislative programme, namely, &ldquo;Heads of the Bill not yet prepared&rdquo;.  There is no question of it having priority.  The same applies to the legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>You can keep me in line, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
        <P>In terms of dealing with issues of sexual offences and strict liability, on which Fine Gael disagreed with other members of the committee, we produced a proposal to reinstate the concept of strict liability to protect young people from sexual predators and sought constitutional change.  The other members of the committee recommended some legislative reform which fell short of constitutional change.  That report was published over a year ago.  The legislation for that is not prioritised either in the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.  I have no idea why the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews pretends otherwise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is interesting, Sir, is that tonight we are having what is the second debate on the joint Oireachtas committee&rsquo;s report that recommends a referendum.  We had the initial debate when the report was made before the House and various people spoke from all sides of the House.  I noted in that debate not a single senior Cabinet Minister representing the Green Party, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party or the now Independent, Deputy Harney, saw fit to contribute to that debate on children&rsquo;s rights and constitutional change.  It is unprecedented that on a proposal for constitutional change that came from an all-party committee where consensus was achieved, not a single senior Cabinet Minister went on the record to say either they support the holding of a referendum in 2010 or they agree with the wording.  Tonight, we have had a repeat of that with two Ministers of State speaking on behalf of the Government.  The Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, delivered a similar set-piece speech to the one we heard previously.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the novelty of the Minister of State, Deputy White, contributing to the debate.  I was very taken with her apparent understanding of the complexities of the issue.  The reason I was taken with that is because the committee met on 62 occasions and Deputy Gogarty, who was a member of the committee, is by coincidence Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills, which is supposed to have some interest in children and children&rsquo;s rights.  Deputy Gogarty managed to attend four out of the 62 meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  He participated in not a single meeting that discussed in any detail or addressed the issue of constitutional change.  On behalf of the Green Party he made no contribution of any nature whatsoever to the framing of the wording.  I welcome the green shoot that has arrived in the D&aacute;il Chamber this evening to <Col N="290"/>explain the complexities of it all to us.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy White.  She is the first elected Member of the Green Party to contribute at all to a debate on this proposal because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am very happy to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;on the previous occasion when we addressed the issue there was not a Green Party Minister, neither a Minister of State nor a Minister, in the House.  All we heard on the issue was the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, on the publication of the Murphy commission report, feeling the need to get his name in <i>The Irish Times</i>, announcing some sort of commitment to an inchoate, unspecified constitutional amendment on children&rsquo;s rights.  The Minister of State, Deputy White did not add any substance to our knowledge of where the Greens stand on the issue.  At least the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, contributed in the committee.  I do not wish to be unfairly hard on him.  He made a constructive contribution to the debate that took place in the committee, unlike any contribution that came from the Greens.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious, Sir, that I have two colleagues who wish to contribute to the debate.  I conclude by saying that I deeply regret that it seems that this House is tomorrow evening going to divide on this issue.  I find it extraordinary that the Government cannot even commit itself to saying it will hold a children&rsquo;s rights referendum in 2010.  Any consultative process that needs to be undertaken at governmental level could well be completed if we were told the referendum would happen at the end of October 2010.  There is more than enough time.  It only took from March of last year to September of last year for the NAMA legislation to be published and debated in this House.  This issue has been teased out to a far greater extent in committee than that legislation ever was teased out.</P>
        <P>I am not impressed, and I do not believe people outside this House are impressed, by the lip service being paid to this issue by the Government and to the damning report of the Ombudsman for Children, which replicated a report kept secret by the HSE.  I suspect it was not fully brought to the attention of the Minister by PA Consulting in October 2009.  It was commissioned by the HSE and it equally set out the dysfunctional nature of the child care and protection service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have a Government that talks about the issue.  The Government should hang its head in shame. As children are dying under the care of the State, the Government is revaricating on the holding of a very basic referendum to extend constitutional protection to children and to change the ethos that would apply both within Departments and State agencies in taking the action necessary to provide to children the protection to which they are entitled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I was struck by the point Deputy Shatter made about the emphasis there has been in this House on NAMA and on how we could bring forward such complex legislation so quickly.  Understandably, there has been a huge concentration in this House in the past year and a half on economic matters.  That is the climate we were in.  However, we need to spend a lot more time looking not just at how we want the country to run economically but how we want the country to be and how we want society to behave.  The biggest measure of any civil society is how we treat our most vulnerable and by any standard our children are the most vulnerable people in society.  The Government is failing them by not holding the referendum.</P>
        <P>I welcome the motion tabled by the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is simply seeking a date for a referendum.  That is not a lot to ask.  I appreciate that there is a level of complexity involved.  I was a member of the committee.  With Deputy Howlin, I was also a member of the <Col N="291"/>previous committee that reported in 2007.  Sometimes I am amused at how Government operates.  The Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, was on the committee.  His predecessor, the then Minister of State, Deputy Smith, was on the committee and his predecessor, the then Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was on the previous committee.  The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, was on the previous committee and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, sometimes attended the most recent committee.  They were involved.  They knew what was going on.  Following meetings where it was decided complex areas would be discussed Fine Gael Party members met as a group, as did members of the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in.  I am not sure what the Green Party did but Fianna F&aacute;il Party members met as a group.  Discussions were held and parties formulated their positions prior to us arriving at our conclusion.  The third report had all-party agreement.  On several occasions, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, went back to the Attorney General for clarification, which means the latter also knew what was going on.  It is not as if a report suddenly landed on a desk in February without anyone&rsquo;s knowledge or that Departments are being asked to deal with a new issue.  I am surprised that it was the Minister for Health and Children who presented a copy of the committee&rsquo;s report to the Cabinet in March because I would have assumed the Minister of State has more expertise from being on the committee.</P>
        <P>This referendum is part of a process of reforming our law and enforcing the legislation that is already in place to protect children.  As a member of the committee, I can understand to an extent the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment that the emphasis of tonight&rsquo;s debate is on child protection when many other issues are set out in the report.  However, it is difficult for us to refrain from emphasising child protection when the system is so appalling and lets children down so badly.  The other issues are also extremely important but do not call for the same degree of urgency.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach, however, reveals a worrying lack of urgency.  We respond to tragedies with debates but then there is silence until another tragedy occurs.  Today&rsquo;s tragedy, unfortunately, involved Daniel McAnaspie.  In three months&rsquo; time there will be another sad case involving a child or young adult and we will have another discussion.  When are we going to see action?</P>
        <P Just="Left">In his third report, the Government&rsquo;s rapporteur, Geoffrey Shannon, identified a number of significant problems.  We still do not have independent oversight of child protection services, a system of inquiring into fundamental failings or consistent application of the Children First guidelines.  Mr. Shannon also recommended a review of our current child protection system.  Why is that work not being done?</P>
        <P>We have spoken about a system that is bursting at the seams.  The system is not working.  A child was murdered today and another 20 died in care over the past decade.  A HSE representative stated on radio this morning that 5,600 children are in care.  Twenty out of 5,600 children is a significant proportion.  How many are missing and why is a distinction being drawn between Irish children who go missing in State care and the other children who come into this country to be exploited?  Are the latter regarded as less important?</P>
        <P>When something happens, we call it a systemic failure as if it was a computer glitch or human error.  A systemic failure means the system is broken and needs to be changed.  I will outline an example of how parts of the system do not communicate with each other.  A family in my area fostered an extremely troubled child and wanted to stick by him even though he became a danger to the family.  His social worker did a lot to help, despite the lack of an out-of-hours service, but the child needed a place in a special school.  The school would not take the child unless the National Educational Psychological Service would agree to provide the necessary <Col N="292"/>services but the latter would not agree to provide the services unless he was placed in the school.  He ended up back in full-time care at enormous cost to the State when he would have been better off in a family environment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State argued that it is unfair to accuse the Government of tardiness on vetting.  Fine Gael first raised the issue of vetting in this House in 2003.  The Government was toing and froing on whether we needed a referendum until committees were established to investigate the issue.  It is far too late to be announcing legislation seven years later.  Furthermore, as Deputy Shatter noted, this legislation continues to languish on section C of the legislative programme after being transferred between three Departments since 2003.  The church has asked experts from the North, such as Mr. Elliott, to advise it.  When will legislation in this area be published?  Every day we wait, we put more children at risk.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the publication of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children last February, it has become glaringly obvious that the Government is not prioritising the needs of our children.  I commend the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in on their attempt to move the process forward by bringing this motion to the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>Far too often in this State, the best interests of our children have been ignored.  Tragically for some Irish children, the State&rsquo;s reaction was far too little, too late with the result that young lives have been ended prematurely.  It is clear from the manner in which it went about its work that the proposals from the Oireachtas committee have the potential to result in greater respect for children&rsquo;s rights in practice and in law.  We signed up to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child almost 20 years ago.  This should have been the catalyst to bring Irish law and practice into line with the principles of children&rsquo;s rights.  The issue of children&rsquo;s rights straddles many aspects of our daily lives in terms of our families and our education, welfare and justice systems.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge in particular the work done to date on children&rsquo;s interaction with the justice system.  It is progressive that the Children Act 2001 established an independent juvenile justice system under the stewardship of Ms Michelle Shannon.  Excellent work has been carried out in this field over the past several years and the results are becoming clear.  However, having committed to this system the Government must renew its commitment to the process.</P>
        <P>A case management system is being piloted in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city under Chief Superintendent Pat Leahy to deal with youth crime.  An individual garda is assigned to co-ordinate all aspects of a young person&rsquo;s case.  This system is child centred, effective and efficient and every effort should be made to roll it out nationally.  I would not like to see an initiative such as this suffer from cutbacks.  There is no doubt from the pilot results that the scheme offers children who are in conflict with the law a better chance of a positive outcome.</P>
        <P>The fact that St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution continues to hold juveniles as young as 16 as well as young men of 21 flies in the face of the UN convention and the best interests of children.  I have no doubt this contributes to the recent statement by the retiring governor of Mountjoy, Mr. John Lonergan, regarding the research published in 2008 which illustrated that up to 72% of individuals in Mountjoy spent time in St. Patrick&rsquo;s during their youth.  We need to break the link between children&rsquo;s detention and young men&rsquo;s detention.  The provision of a new specific national child detention facility at Oberstown, near Lusk in County Dublin, is an initiative that must not be put on the long finger.  It is all very well to have concept designs and detailed models but the replies to parliamentary questions I have submitted on the matter indicate that the timeline for delivery of the project has been extended.  It started with a commitment that phase one would be completed by 2012, a deadline that now stands at mid-2013.  I appeal to <Col N="293"/>the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as he prepares his submission to the Department of Finance on next year&rsquo;s budget, not to stall on this vital project.</P>
        <P>I have made the point on many occasions that gangland criminals exploit our decision to raise progressively the age of criminal intent to 12 years.  Children under this age cannot be prosecuted under law and there is evidence that criminal gangs are using this as a loophole.  While we will have to deal with this issue through specific legislation, a constitutional amendment on children&rsquo;s rights will help.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>We must show solidarity with Greece and with all fellow European Union member states.  I and my party are very much pro-Europe.  However, the first question we must ask is whether the aid package will work.  From a short-term liquidity perspective the answer is that, like the Government guarantee scheme of 29 September 2008, it probably will.  Will it address the long-term solvency issue for Greece?  That remains to be seen.  These are the questions that must be asked.</P>
        <P>In terms of the financial stability mechanism currently being discussed in Brussels, at a cost of &euro;750 billion, we must have all the details.  Moreover, we need to know whether there will be a jobs dimension to the process.  In Ireland, half the general government deficit is a result of unemployment, but the Government has no initiative to address this.  The markets are nervous that the austerity measures will be so severe that we will have growth in countries&rsquo; national debts and unemployment will stagnate at current levels.  The Government must produce an effective jobs stimulus package.</P>
        <P>Section 4 should be amended to change the reporting mechanism from annual to quarterly.  The reference in the loan facility agreement to ranking <i>pari passu</i> with existing professional bond holders must be examined.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, elaborate on the indication that we will not make a loss from this process?</P>

	<P>Last Sunday the magazine section of the <i>Financial Times</i> included a four-page article entitled &ldquo;A Plague on their Houses: How Bankers, Builders and Politicians Brought Ireland to its Knees&rdquo;.  The article observed that at the &ldquo;height of the lunacy&rdquo;, three quarters of total Irish bank lending was for property construction, land and speculation.  This is described in the article as what Ireland did for a living.  Yet while all this was going on, the then Minister for Finance, now Taoiseach, told us that the fundamentals of the Irish economy were sound.  Moreover, we were told in the late summer of 2008 that the banks were sound and solvent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">By the end of September 2008, however, the deposits of most of our financial institutions had to be guaranteed.  We were subsequently told we would have to take on a significant portion of their debt under the NAMA process but that this would provide the cheapest bailout in the world.  It turns out, however, that it is the most expensive bailout in the history of the OECD.  We were told that the haircut applied under NAMA would be 23%, but the assets transferred so far have had an average discount of 50% and it is expected that the haircut on the next tranche will be even greater.  We were then told that Anglo Irish Bank is of fundamental systemic importance to the Irish economy.  We have since seen that it has been fundamental to the ruination of the country.  We have already committed at least &euro;22 billion that we will never see again as a result of the bailing out of that bank.</P><Col N="294"/>
        <P>Almost every week we find ourselves exposed to another &euro;1 billion, &euro;2 billion, &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion, and the Government is obliged to revise the promises or assertions it made the previous week.  The story keeps changing.  The Minister of State must forgive us then for being a little apprehensive when we find that over a weekend, we were suddenly exposed to a further &euro;6 billion between our share of the Greek bailout and our contribution to the stabilisation fund.  We recognise that the financial situation in Europe was as grave that weekend as it has ever been.  We accept that decisive action had to be taken.  My concern is that every time the Government takes decisive nation it costs the nation money.  Moreover, on every occasion, it has been wrong in its predictions of the outcome of its strong decisions.  It has been wrong even in its understanding of those decisions.  I strongly suspect that when the guarantee was given on that fateful day in September 2008, the Government did not even realise that the guarantee extended to bonds.  If it did know, it did not understand the implications &mdash; that it would be a millstone around the neck of the next generation.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s so-called decisive actions, made in haste and with no parliamentary discussion or scrutiny, have led us into a vortex of repeatedly throwing good money after bad.  Given that almost every action and statement made by the Government on the financial and banking front has been wrong &mdash; and sometimes proved wrong within days &mdash; it is just a little foolhardy for the Taoiseach to run off to Europe and sign up to the provision of another &euro;1.3 billion.  I accept that we must contribute to bailing out Greece, but this was done without any prior consideration in the national Parliament of the terms of that bailout or its implications for Ireland.</P>
        <P>We were told that our portion of the bailout would be based on our share in the European Central Bank.  That seems fair until one considers that we are paying more per household than any other eurozone country with the exception of Luxembourg which is the richest country in Europe if not the world.  Is it fair that debt-ridden Ireland, the country carrying the highest level of personal, banking and Government debt, should pay more per household than any other member state?  Three days after the initial announcement, our disproportionate burden was compounded by a further commitment of &euro;4.4 billion to the eurozone stabilisation fund.  Was the Government aware of the disproportionate household burden for Irish families?  Was any other formula even considered, such as the agreed formula modified by consideration of debt per household in each country?  Alternatively, was consideration given to a greater burden for those countries that engaged in reckless lending and are now, bizarrely, horrified by the reckless borrowing of others?  I understand the Germans were the big lenders.  In giving this money to Greece, we are effectively bailing out the German banks.</P>
        <P>The tragedy is that the debate on the legislation to confirm our Greek commitment is virtually irrelevant because it is too late to influence any aspect of what the Government has signed up to, too late to use another formula, too late to get a fairer deal for Ireland and too late to even say it is too late.  Time and again, particularly at budget time, Deputies Bruton and Kenny have called for a different way of doing our business, particularly in respect of major decisions including budget decisions and decisions such as this, and emphasised the need to use our Parliament to tease out issues before they are set in stone so that mistakes are avoided, pitfalls are foreseen in time and unfairness such as that arising from this process is prevented.  Europe is now demanding surveillance of our budgets.  Does it occur even now to the Government that if we did our own surveillance properly and if Parliament played its correct role as a watchdog for the people, we might never have ended up in our current mess?</P>
        <P>The Minister in his speech criticised me for even pointing out that we are paying disproportionately more than other eurozone countries.  I regard it as my duty to point that out and I resent the Minister&rsquo;s suggestion that it is somehow unpatriotic to do so.  The reality is that <Col N="295"/>debt per household is a very legitimate measure of a country&rsquo;s well-being and of its ability to borrow and make repayments.  Therefore I absolutely stand over what I say.  The Minister is wrong to suggest we should not question the manner in which responsibility was shared among countries.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach stated last week, he must convey confidence in Ireland&rsquo;s ability to survive.  While this is true, one does not inspire confidence by burying one&rsquo;s head in the sand, hiding the facts or pretending everything is rosy in the garden.  It was this approach that landed Ireland and Greece in the mess in which we find ourselves.  The Government has a history of making decisions behind closed doors, in haste and informed only by vested interests.  It does not appear to have learned the lesson that if one is continually wrong, one must change the way in which one does business.</P>
        <P>Many have raised the loss of sovereignty arising from the proposed requirement for greater surveillance of national budgets in the European Union.  The real loss of sovereignty has been in this House, not Europe, and has been caused by a Government which will not learn from the mistakes of the past, for which people are paying.  The Government has abrogated the role, responsibilities and powers of the people&rsquo;s Parliament by preventing proper scrutiny of decisions before they become irreversible.  The decision before us is now irreversible.</P>
        <P>While the Fine Gael Party supports the bailout for Greece, I challenge the Minister&rsquo;s assertion that we will get our money back.  We will sing for this money.  It is being paid out on the understanding that it will not be returned and on the sole condition that it will prevent the collapse of the euro.  Nevertheless, the bailout was necessary.  My party also accepts the need for greater control of eurozone country deficits.  We do not, however, accept that these matters cannot be discussed in this Parliament, whose role is to act as the watchdog for the people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will share time with Deputy Michael Mulcahy.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance has set out in detail the context of the Bill and its provisions.  Notwithstanding arguments made, I welcome what I understand to be the support of the main Opposition parties for the Bill.</P>
        <P>European Union and euro membership are fundamental to our positioning as a country and our economic strategy.  We have every interest in sustaining not only our euro participation but the currency itself.  Every member is systemic to the euro, which means in recent times we have had to do what was necessary.  Those who have been observing events will have noted that this storm has been brewing up for some time, certainly over the past two or three months.</P>
        <P>There are, among certain high profile commentators outside the House, some who urge us to part company with the euro.  In that context, I will cite the words of Kevin Gardiner, the man who invented the phrase &ldquo;Celtic tiger&rdquo; in August 1994.  Mr. Gardiner, who is Irish, is the head of investment strategy for the Europe, Middle East and Asia region, EMEA, at Barclays Wealth.  In a recent article, he noted:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Euro participation is part of the competitive package that initially made Ireland such an attractive place in which to invest.  After all, if a large US company wants to invest in an English-speaking, financially volatile and euro-sceptic EU base outside the single currency, there is always the UK.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Precisely.  There are echoes in Mr. Gardiner&rsquo;s words of my favourite historical quotation, which is from Thomas Addis Emmet.  Answering a question at a parliamentary committee on the causes of the 1798 rebellion as to how Ireland could possibly go it alone economically, he <Col N="296"/>replied: &ldquo;America is the best market in the world and Ireland is the best situated country in Europe to trade with that market.&rdquo;  These words sum up our position if not then, certainly now.</P>
        <P>There is a necessity not only in Ireland but around the world to pull the financial reins tighter and get on to a more sustainable path.  While we could have found ourselves in the same position as Greece, we have not done so.  With all due respect to Deputy Mitchell, the reason is that we have taken many correct decisions during this crisis.  The Deputy quoted one article from the <i>Financial Times</i>.  One could find many quotations, particularly in recent weeks, in praise of the course being followed by Ireland.</P>
        <P>The position has been the same for the best part of two years.  Either we make our own necessary choices or have them imposed on us in a way we may not like or choose.  Experience has shown that complying with the Maastricht criteria, while necessary, is far from sufficient because the buoyancy in many countries, whether one describes it as a boom or bubble or uses another word, has hidden a much more vulnerable situation.</P>
        <P>We are not paying the Greeks but providing money that is pooled by the European Commission, which is lending to Greece.  I do not believe there is any fundamental dispute that we have to show solidarity.  If we do not hang together, we will hang separately and there are powerful speculative forces.  I was interested in the argument as to the reason they justify their attacks on the euro, namely, that countries will either not be able to sustain the difficult policies they are imposing or having imposed on them or, alternatively, if they all do so successfully, they will depress the economy so much so that it is not successful.  The attitude seems to be one of heads one loses, tails one loses.  Nonetheless, I am hopeful that as a result of the decisions taken on Sunday, 9 May, the situation will gradually stabilise and turn around with further details of implementation.</P>
        <P>There has been some debate inside and outside the House on the issue of European surveillance.  The European Commission has put forward some propositions to which many governments have reacted.  Budgetary surveillance is of two kinds, both of which we are accustomed to in some degree.  One relates to specific budget measures which may offend against state aid rules.  Often, in budget speeches, the Minister states he will introduce a certain scheme subject to the consent of the European Commission.  Some weeks or months later, this consent is generally forthcoming and the measure is then implemented.  The second is a more general type of surveillance which is reflected in the EU stability report that appears at the back of the budget booklet.  This is normally three or four year projections on the sustainability of the public finances.  There has not been a particular difficulty in principle.    We announced months before this year&rsquo;s budget that we would be seeking &euro;4 billion in expenditure cuts, and that was duly implemented.</P>
        <P>I was surprised by the shrill nature of the initial Fine Gael reaction to those proposals.  I wondered on radio whether it was connected with concerns about the NewERA document.  I was re-reading it on the train from Tipperary on Saturday and it seems to involve quite a lot of additional borrowing which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a theoretical debate in Europe on whether the current situation requires more economic and monetary union.  I represent the country on the EU budget council and the reality is that there is no willingness among our partners to put more funds into the EU budget.  In fact, many of them would like to put even less money into it.  We have an interest in defending the sums that are put into the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
        <P>Apart from some excise duties on the night, the budget is not set in stone until the Finance Bill is passed so there is plenty of time to discuss and refine budget measures in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill in so far as it amounts to Ireland&rsquo;s effort to help a fellow eurozone member, namely, Greece.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s speech and I agree with it entirely.  It is quite clear, however, that more needs to be said.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first issue I would like to raise is the issue of scrutiny of all that has transpired in recent weeks.  The Lisbon treaty promised greater scrutiny of EU matters, especially by national parliaments, and contained specific protocols in respect of scrutiny and subsidiarity issues, yet this debate is the first on this issue, either in the Chamber or in any D&aacute;il committee.  I have to put my hands up as a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny.  This matter has been trundling along for some weeks, beginning on 11 April when finance ministers across Europe agreed to the terms of the formal support to be given to Greece.   On 14 April the Government agreed with this and approved the preparation of legislation.  On 8 May the European Commission signed the loan facility agreement.  I appreciate that things happen quickly in international financial markets.  However, the lack of scrutiny on this issue to date has been inadequate.  We must look at more in-depth scrutiny of other vital EU issues as they move along.  I hope colleagues can agree with me in supporting that general point.</P>
        <P>The terms of this assistance to Greece have been set out by the Minister and the Minister of State.  It consists of &euro;110 billion over three years.  This will represent a very difficult time for <Col N="298"/>Greece, much as it represents a difficult time for Ireland.  We know it will require a large downward adjustment of the debt to GDP ratio in Greece from 2013 onwards.  Greece will be required to keep primary balances in surplus to at least 5% until 2020.  It will involve a cut in Greece&rsquo;s public sector wage bill and pension outlays, an increase in excise taxes and further increases in VAT.  These are very similar to the measures we have seen in our budgetary and fiscal adjustment.  These budgetary issues have stretched across Europe to reach many member states.  There is hardly one country in or outside the eurozone that is not having to make substantial adjustments in its budgetary position.</P>
        <P>I welcome the establishment of a European financial stabilisation mechanism, which represents an early scrutiny of the budgetary cycle.  It was referred to by the Minister of State and it is very important.  Some people made the point that it might represent a loss of sovereignty as the European Commission and perhaps the European Parliament would be involved in internal budgetary matters.  What use is sovereignty if one is bankrupt?  What use is sovereignty if people are going to be rioting on the streets and discommoded?  It was implicit in the single currency that governments would stick to their proposed maximum 3% budget deficit per year.  It is a sorry state of affairs that the opposite has come to pass in Ireland.  The Irish Government ran substantial surpluses for most of the early years of this decade.  We were not running deficits.  There was a surplus of &euro;2.1 billion in 2004, &euro;1.9 billion in 2005, &euro;5.3 billion in 2006 and &euro;500 million in 2007.  We had a collapse in tax revenues in 2008 and there was a deficit of &euro;13 billion, while there was a &euro;19 billion deficit in 2009.  The point I am making is that in the good times, unlike in other countries, we were actually running budget surpluses and so were strictly adhering to the EU criteria.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>That was property related.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever its cause, we were running surpluses.  It has always been the intention of any Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration that we would adhere to that maximum 3% budget deficit requirement at all times.</P>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am very proud that the Government is committed to reducing our budget deficit to 3% by 2014.  We have already taken several clear and decisive steps in various budgets and adjustments to public pay.  I pay tribute to all those public servants who have recognised the need to make that adjustment in the national interest.  We have taken these decisive steps on the roadway despite every possible block being put in our path by the Opposition parties in this D&aacute;il.  I have yet to hear from the Opposition parties a clear and unambiguous commitment to reducing our budget deficit to 3% by 2014 in clear and unequivocal terms.  I do not believe they will make that commitment.</P>
        <P>The leader of the Labour Party was happy to accuse the Taoiseach of treason.  I would suggest that history will judge very harshly all those politicians who, for naked political gain, have impeded the Government in its very important work of reducing the public deficit and bringing our finance into balance.  Perhaps it is some Members of the Opposition who should hold the mirror of patriotism up to their own faces and see if they can recognise a noble reflection in it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We have been told on numerous occasions that the purpose of this rescue package for Greece is to stabilise the euro.  The contributions by the 15 member states are headed by Germany with &euro;22 billion, followed by Italy, France and the Netherlands with <Col N="299"/>&euro;14 million, &euro;16 million and &euro;9 million.  We realise that those major economies in Europe have seen it as essential to support the euro.  Given that it is Greece that is in trouble, one wonders whether it would be the same for all other countries in Europe if any of them had fallen into this plight.</P>
        <P>In page 16 of the Bill, item No. 14 states: &ldquo;This Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it shall be governed by and shall be construed in accordance with English law&rdquo;.  I find that strange on the basis that Britain is not a contributor because it is outside the eurozone, why is there this reference to English law?</P>
        <P>Since the start of 2010 the Greek Government has shown its determination to address its fiscal difficulties through its three-year programme.  One wonders how effective it can be when we see that it is a question of raising VAT to 21%, increasing taxes on alcohol, tobacco, petrol and diesel.  A property tax is to be included and pensions are to be reformed.  Most other countries in Europe have a far wider economic base than has Greece.  What has it other than tourism?  It has very little for export.  Deputy Bruton made the contrast today in saying that while Ireland has many similarities and some of the same needs as has Greece regarding recovery, we have a very important export trade with other European countries and beyond.  One wonders whether it will be possible for Greece with those efforts of reconstruction of the economy to extract itself from the difficulties in which it finds itself despite the fact that it is getting an enormous subvention of &euro;80 billion over three years from the eurozone countries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is stated that the European Commission has imposed strict surveillance conditions on Greece for the first time.  On many occasions the Bill provides for very obvious interference by Europe &mdash; interference might be too strong a word.  Repeatedly the EU, the Council of Ministers, the Commission or the ECB are all there on the sidelines.  There is a series of watchdogs demanding serious input into the decisions made within the Greek economy.  One wonders whether this is the first real establishment of the power of Europe, a power it has not had to date.  This seems the first time it has the opportunity to flex its muscles and impose on member states its particular policies.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.</P>
        <P>The Minister and representatives of other governments have said that there will be a profit for the countries that have made these loans.  They are bilateral loans on the one hand, while at the same time the governance is not between the lending state and the borrower.  Europe is the dominant force.  It needs explanation as to why it should be called bilateral.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that the Commission &ldquo;shall open an account in the name of the Lenders with the ECB, to be used for processing all payments on behalf of the Lenders and the Borrower in the context of this Agreement&rdquo;.  The Commission has the power with regard to the lenders&rsquo; loans to the borrower.  Will it have the same determination and power regarding the repayment of the loans?  If there is default, what is the process then?  I believe the Bill provides that the lender then goes after the borrower rather than the Commission, whereas in this instance it states, &ldquo;The Commission shall open an account in the name of the Lenders with the ECB, to be used for processing all payments on behalf of the Lenders and the Borrower in the context of this Agreement.&rdquo;  Does the reverse apply when the repayments are being made?</P>
        <P>We have reached various critical dates in early 2010, including on 25 March, in April, and on 4 May and 11 May.  Tomorrow, 19 May, is the crucial day with the reception of the loans.  The Bill states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The rights of each Lender under or in connection with this Agreement shall be separate and independent rights and any debt arising under this Agreement to a Lender from the Borrower shall be a separate and independent debt.  The Borrower shall not give priority to one Lender over the other Lenders.</P><Col N="300"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">Surely as I have said, there is an obligation on the Commission to move into that particular area and make a decision.  Certainly no priority can be given to one rather than another.  It is clear that with Germany providing &euro;22 billion, it will have the first bite of the cherry.</P>
        <P>In Ireland the Revenue always has first bite of the cherry in this regard.</P>
        <P>Another issue I wish to bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention concerns the scrutiny and surveillance by the Commission of activities in Greece.  If we apply the same effort and endeavour to countries such as Ireland, Portugal and perhaps Spain, and if similar situations recur, there is a danger of a very serious adverse effect on the euro.  Will the same degree of support continue within the EU?</P>
        <P>We are talking essentially about the 15 members of the eurozone that are making contributions.  Some member states, especially Britain, which has a huge deficit as we know from the very recent past, have not shown the same solidarity with the eurozone as have other countries that have their own currencies.  One wonders therefore whether there is a two-tier Europe now because of the absence of support for Greece from these non-euro countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this very important and topical Euro Area Loan Facility Bill 2010.  The entire situation in Greece has dominated our television screens in recent months.  There are very serious problems there and we have all seen the violence reported on television.  Unfortunately, a number of people were killed as a result.</P>
        <P>There has been much scaremongering in this House in recent days, with accusations of anti-European sentiments thrown across the floor at Fine Gael by Government Deputies when Deputy Enda Kenny and our finance spokesperson, Deputy Richard Bruton, raised legitimate questions regarding the future of Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary process.  As a result of the bailout package agreed for Greece last week by the EU Finance Ministers it appears Ireland will have to have pre-clearance from the European Commission before a budget can even be discussed in this House.  It is a sizable sum of money but Greece is in dire financial straits.  We do not want a rollercoaster effect if Greece fails to live up to its budgetary commitments.</P>
        <P>I reject the accusations from across the floor of the House.  They are completely unjustified.  It is a sad attempt by a very tired Government to deflect attention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Here we go again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;from the fact that the economy has been brought to its knees by the Minister of State&rsquo;s Government.  I must say that.  We are supporting this Bill and have every right to question budgetary procedures and the plans for greater EU scrutiny of our country&rsquo;s budget, as agreed last week.  For years we have been demanding a radical overhaul and have sought greater transparency and a greater role for parliaments in the budgetary process.  It is extremely important that Parliament has a role.  </P>
        <P>Nobody denies the doomsday scenario Greece is facing and the threat to the survival of the euro.  Some years ago the European Commission celebrated the fact that the euro was one of the most successful currencies after being in place ten years.  We are now in a very different scenario.</P>
        <P>The &euro;110 billion bailout agreed by the EU dwarfs any bailout ever witnessed for any other country.  One might compare it to the IMF bailouts of Mexico and Argentina, of $30 billion and $8 billion, respectively, or that of South Korea, whose population was almost five times that of Greece, which received $58 billion in a rescue package during the Asian financial crisis in 1997.  That bailout was unprecedented in European terms and it anticipated the revelation <Col N="301"/>by the Greek Government which was elected last September that the country&rsquo;s deficits had been understated for a number of years by the previous Government.  In other words, it had cooked the books and sent different figures to Brussels which put us in the situation we are in now.  This drove the markets wild and many European countries became very concerned about their banking systems, fearing another collapse similar to what happened in Lehmans Bank in the United States some time ago.  In particular, Germany had to cough up more than &euro;22 billion for the loan to Greece.  The German banks were saturated with Government bonds from Greece and it was that situation coupled with the fact that regional elections were taking place in the country which led to the reluctance on the part of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, to support the rescue package.  Perhaps if Germany had acted sooner we might not be in this situation.  However, that is politics and that is what happens when elections are coming up.  There was a similar situation in the United Kingdom where hard decisions must be made now after the election.</P>
        <P>It is important that Ireland shows solidarity for Greece.  There is no doubt that the Irish taxpayer will have to pay a heavy price.  The Minister stated today the money would be paid back but we are right to ask questions in this House.  We must ask them on behalf of the taxpayer.  That is why they elect us and that is why Deputies Kenny and Bruton asked those questions.  Four billion euro was cut in last year&rsquo;s budget and further cuts are on the way, as we have heard from Ministers who have four weeks to come up with another &euro;3 billion worth of spending cuts.  Further tax increases are probably on the cards for 2011.  As a result of last week&rsquo;s agreement  front line services in health, education and social welfare are all expected to come under the spotlight again.   Much pain has been inflicted already on the Irish taxpayer who has tolerated a lot already.  Our situation is not the same as that in Greece but people are very angry.  Last week there was a similar situation when the spotlight was put on old age pensioners.  There are threats to cut the pension again and the situation is very uncertain for the future.</P>
        <P>In spite of the Greek bailout the markets continue to be volatile and there is considerable uncertainty.  When word filtered through of the bailout at the weekend there was an initial surge in response in the US and European stock markets.  Attention quickly turned to the high level of sovereign debt and whether this would add to the debt load of already over-indebted European countries.  The interest rate for the Irish Government&rsquo;s requirement to borrow from sovereign debt markets rose by 20 basic points, from 0.2% to 4.7% last week, the third highest rise in those markets in Europe after those for Greece and Portugal.</P>
        <P>The austerity measures introduced in Greece and the bailout from European member states has done nothing to quell spectators, and government bonds traded in such small quantities, particularly in countries like Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, forced the European Central Bank to reverse a prior refusal and agree to purchase eurozone government bonds to help restore confidence in the market.</P>
        <P>This shows how serious the position was, and some economists are worried that if the rescue package fails in calming the markets, European countries could end up footing a bill of &euro;500 billion to save other countries.  We need a strong euro and today we saw the currency hovering around its lowest level, at approximately $1.22.  We all know that a weak euro will have significant costs when we buy our barrels of oil in dollars.  There will be a real effect on everybody at the petrol pumps.</P>
        <P>Everybody agrees that saving Greece is important and it is vital that we show solidarity with our European counterparts.  There is no doubt that, like here in Ireland, ordinary people in Athens, on the thousands of islands and throughout Greece will have to suffer real hardship if <Col N="302"/>the austerity measures are introduced.  The EU governments must co-ordinate fiscal monetary policies, and Fine Gael agrees with such action.</P>
        <P>I heard our spokesperson, Deputy Richard Bruton, arguing tonight that parliament participation is very important and must be a key element in these processes.  Budgetary proposals should be scrutinised in this Parliament before any decisions are rubber-stamped at EU level.  The Minister for Finance might clarify the position of this House, if any, in advance of agreeing budgets with the EU and what levels of scrutiny might be involved.  Deputy Bruton said this evening that Ireland can correct the errors of the past but will not succeed if responsibility for the work is simply passed to others.  More clarity is required on the implications of the agreement for the Irish taxpayer and I look forward to the response of the Minister tomorrow, as well as the contributions of others in this debate.</P>

	<P>At the outset it would be wrong of me to say I welcome the Bill because all of us would prefer not to deal with such legislation.  We are part of a team with European colleagues and there is a certain responsibility and onus to play our part at a very difficult time for many European countries, with Greece the focus tonight.</P>
        <P>One would be forgiven for getting an impression from various commentators both within and outside the House that we are the only country in financial difficulty, although nothing could be further from the truth.  We are one country of many throughout Europe and the developed world that has been hit very severely by a recession which has taken its toll.  We are not unique in that sense.  For the record, Fianna F&aacute;il was not in power in any of the other countries; we were in power here but if there was a recession in Germany, the UK or the US, other governments were in power in those countries.</P>
        <P>I am not for a moment arguing that we did not make mistakes because we did, without question.  We should always own up to those mistakes and take responsibility for them.</P>

	<P>Is that an apology?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="303"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>We should not have any difficulty admitting that.  We should move on from the tired argument at this stage.  When we made the tough decisions we were told they were wrong and would not get the country out of trouble.  Now we have turned a corner and people are saying we are not doing so badly, we see a return to the old argument that this Government is responsible for the current economic position.</P>
        <P>It is important to record that the Greeks obviously misled the European Commission and their colleagues in Europe, telling bare-faced lies.  It is okay to argue that it was an election year but we had local elections last year, and our party and coalition partners faced up to very tough decisions prior to the election.  Those decisions cost us many good people throughout the country who lost their seats not for their own sins, but the sins of their party in government, which was forced to make tough choices.  We did not dodge the issue.</P>
        <P>If we are to lay blame at the Taoiseach&rsquo;s door, and many people do, we should note that he has parked the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and organisation, putting the focus instead on the country.  He knows we must take tough decisions that will affect the party and have a negative effect that will lead to numerous percentage points being dropped in opinion polls.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>It sounds like an obituary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>To the Taoiseach&rsquo;s credit, and whatever is said or unsaid, history will be kind to Deputy Brian Cowen as Taoiseach and leader of my party for his bravery in putting his country first and not playing politics by looking at county council seats or gaining points in polls.  He put his country first and history will be very kind to him for that reason.</P>
        <P>We can consider many commentaries, particularly those in Europe and outside our country, which argue that Ireland has got it right.  An editorial from 4 May in <i>The Irish Times </i>was headlined &ldquo;Hopeful Indicators&rdquo;.  It stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Count the number of ships using Dublin Bay and you get a fairly good impression of the overall health of the economy.  Traffic there slowed dramatically in 2008 and 2009.  But now, the good news is that trade is recovering at Dublin Port&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">That is just one indicator and I could also quote Jean-Claude Trichet, who is a very well respected gentleman in his own field in Europe.  He has said we got it right.  Davy Stockbrokers have said the Irish economy is out of recession, and there is declining cross-Border shopping as competitiveness improves.</P>
        <P>These are all positive indicators, although I am not saying for a moment we are out of the woods because we are not.  A Member on the benches opposite correctly stated that we are facing into a very difficult budget again this year and we must make very difficult cuts.  I admire the bravery of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, as well as other Ministers and colleagues on the backbenches.  They have never flinched from their responsibility and have walked up these steps night after night, on the day of the budget and subsequent to the budget, to make tough decisions that were right for this country.  We cannot be questioned on such actions.  They are unpopular and our party is losing points in polls, which I accept, but we had little choice.</P>
        <P>It has been mentioned that there are threats to the old age pension.  I have the utmost confidence in the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and the pensioners in this country can sleep easy in the knowledge that he is in that portfolio.  That man has a fantastic tradition from his family background within our parliamentary party and he has a great feel for rural and elderly people in particular.  I am sure he will do a good job.</P><Col N="304"/>
        <P>We do not need to be reminded of this issue by anybody else, as we have been very solid in our support for the elderly and vulnerable in our society.  We have substantially increased the pension year on year for the past number of years, a fact of which I am proud.  That cannot be taken from us.  It will not always be dark at whatever hour of the evening it becomes dark at the moment; there will always be a better day.  We should not curse the dark but light a candle instead.  We should be positive and talk our country and economy up, which is very important.</P>
        <P>I remember hearing two pensioners in conversation last year, with one saying the pension had been cut by &euro;8.  The other acknowledged that fact but said that if the IMF came in, they would not have &euro;80 per week.  That is a fair comment.  We did not reach that stage.  We tackled the issues in time.</P>
        <P>We regret that we have arrived at this point.  Peoples lives have become difficult.  We make decisions on a weekly basis that have a direct impact on people&rsquo;s quality of life, but what we must discuss from now on is the creation of jobs and getting people back into the workplace.  People have taken cuts in their pay, which has been difficult.  Those who have received pay cuts, including every Deputy, must try to adjust their budgets accordingly.  However, if someone is told on a Friday evening that his or her job is gone, having no wages the following week will be difficult.  If that person&rsquo;s spouse or partner is told something similar the following week, it is also difficult.  We would no longer be discussing pay cuts.  Rather, we would be discussing the loss of a household&rsquo;s income, a serious situation for people to bear.</P>
        <P>Many thousands of people have lost their jobs, but I always make the point that I do not accept the figure of 430,000 people unemployed.  I am not saying the live register is lying, but when there was full employment, some 130,000 people were unemployed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Signing on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>To achieve full employment, we needed to bring thousands of foreign nationals into our country to work in our service industries.  For one reason or another, the 130,000 people signing on were not in a position to take up employment.  As such, I always take 130,000 people away from the overall figure.  I am not playing games, but being honest.  While those people are considered to be signing on to the live register, they are not in a position to take up or are incapable of taking up employment, in many instances through no fault of their own.  We should take this factor into account.</P>
        <P>We must link the able-bodied people benefiting from the social welfare system with the provision of services locally, be it working for local authorities or supporting voluntary organisations.  We must tie those people in.  We must get them out of their beds and houses in the morning and into places of work.  We must give them their dignity back and provide them with incomes.  During the course of this year, the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and the Government could do much with this capacity to put people back into the workplace.</P>
        <P>As with all colleagues, I receive requests day after day from people who are trying to join community employment schemes.  To them, the benefit is the restoration of their dignity and the ability to contribute to their communities.  The more we do of this, the better.  It is a step in the right direction.  A CE scheme might not be permanent, full-time, pensionable employment, but it would take someone off the live register, give him or her a place of work and allow him or her to make a contribution to the local community and the country&rsquo;s economy.</P>
        <P>Greece must make tough decisions.  It does not deny that it told the European Commission lies.  I understand that a part of the reason was that it was an election year.  Why would the European Commission not be ultra careful in ensuring against a recurrence among the other member states?  This is not just about Greece.  Instead, it is about the European Community <Col N="305"/>and its further development and security.  If people behave in the same manner as the Greeks, I am not surprised that the EU, which has put a rescue package for the Greek economy in place, wants to ensure proper policies are pursued.  I have no difficulty in this regard.</P>
        <P>We are the masters of our destiny.  We will control it at all times.  Next September, the Cabinet will agree a budget that will be introduced by the Minister for Finance in the House.  The EU is not telling us it wants to see the detail of the budget.  Rather, it wants to ensure we are making good on our commitment to the European Central Bank, ECB, and the EU.  Last year, we committed to removing &euro;4 billion from our economy.  We did it.  Our commitment this year is &euro;3 billion.  We will do it.  I understand &euro;1 billion in capital savings has already been identified, that there will be additional taxation and that further savings will be made across every spectrum.  Any Minister who is asked about savings in his or her Department would be right not to rule anything out.  It is the only way a Minister can operate.  He or she must examine the Department&rsquo;s budget and then make a decision.  I would have no difficulty with the Commission telling us that it wants to ensure we are honouring our commitments because I do not doubt we will do so.  I have no reason to worry in this regard either, since it is not as if we are giving away our sovereignty or as if the Commission will tell us how to run our business.  The Commission and our colleagues in Europe are paying the piper.  For our benefit and that of every other member state, Europe must ensure the Greeks behave.</P>
        <P>While we are making a contribution that we can ill afford and the National Treasury Management Agency will source funds of up to &euro;1.3 billion in loans that Ireland will make available over three years, we will receive a repayment of interest.  We got no return on previous bailouts that were made in this country over the years.</P>

	<P>It wanted to sell bonds valued at &euro;1 billion and &euro;1.5 billion this morning, but it was unsure how the sale would go.  The full &euro;1.5 billion in bonds were snapped up as soon as they went on offer.  This says something about our economy.  We have regained the respect of the financial markets and of the people who buy bonds.  The NTMA has borrowed two thirds of the required funding for this year and has a further &euro;20 billion tucked away.  I admire the NTMA for what it has done, since the ability to do so is important.  We are not looking for a bailout, but we must respect the fact that we are part of a team.  We stand up and play our part admirably.</P>
        <P>Given our economy, we are fortunate to be ahead of the posse.  We took the tough decisions.  Last week, our nearest neighbours in Britain were arguing.  The outgoing Prime Minister argued that there should be no cuts this year while some of the incoming individuals argued that there should be cuts this year.  If we had not cut when we did, we would have been putting off the inevitable.  We have given the rest of Europe an example.  On 11 May, <i>The Times</i> told its readers that if they were &ldquo;deep in debt, the Irish can show you a way out&rdquo;.  I did not write these headlines, but they are factual.  What surprises me is that most favourable comment is coming from outside Ireland.  I wonder why.  As late as night, two economists were sitting on the same panel and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was lucky to get a word in edgeways.</P>

	<P>We can believe the glass is half full or half empty.  I have spoken already on the issue of the 430,000 people on the live register.  I am saying now that there are 1.8 million people in this country in good employment, a fact which does not appear to be appreciated.  One can say we blew the boom but we put 1 million people to work, decreased the national debt, increased the pension fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, that is pretty minuscule in the overall context.  As I said at the outset, governments make mistakes.  They are not infallible; they take the best advice at any given time and do not have the benefit of hindsight.</P>
        <P>We must make tough decisions as did the British and the Greeks.  Other countries will have to do likewise.  We have made tough decisions.  While we are far from being out of the woods, with co-operation and support from all sides, we can move forward and ensure we return to growth during the next couple of years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to see Deputy Cregan is in fighting form and to learn that Fianna F&aacute;il is not responsible for the Greek tragedy.  While the Labour Party supports this Bill, it is legislation which should not have had to come before this House.  The Bill commits us to support Greece up to &euro;1.5 billion in loans on a bilateral basis.  It is important we do this because Greece is currently in serious danger of defaulting on the first tranche of loans that are required to be paid by tomorrow.  In that respect, some countries have already made their contribution to the fund.  We require legislation to do so and so our loans cannot be given until the end of the month.  I would like to hear from the Minister when replying when the first tranche is likely to be made.</P>
        <P>While we would prefer not to have to do this, it is important to acknowledge the principle of what we are doing in solidarity with other members of the European Union.  In many ways, this is what is at the heart of the European project, namely, solidarity between the member states of Europe who should seek to pursue peace and prosperity.  That was the origins of the European project.  Whatever else we say about what is happening now, this is a benchmark and an important moment with all countries in the eurozone coming together to bail out a member state that has fallen on hard times, harder than most.  In many ways, Greece is the prodigal son because not alone did it misgovern its country, it told lies to the European Union and provided false statistics on its misgovernment.  Whatever about Fianna F&aacute;il misgoverning this country, in <Col N="307"/>so far as we can gather, it has not falsely informed the European Union of the statistics in that regard which means we would at least be able to address the issue as it stands.  The Greeks went a step further than we did.</P>
        <P>While this legislation is an urgent response, the situation can be traced back some time.  The Taoiseach has during the past month been attending summits in Brussels on a fairly regular basis.  Usually a summit is held once every quarter.  However, the Taoiseach is away today, was away last week and will no doubt be abroad again before this economic crisis is dealt with.  What I find quite unacceptable is that despite all this toing and froing to Europe by the Taoiseach he has not found time to brief this House on the discussions he has had with Heads of State in Europe in regard to Ireland&rsquo;s reason for supporting these measures.  We are speaking here not about &euro;1.3 billion but about the stabilisation mechanism which will require up to &euro;7.22 billion, also committed to in principle at this time.  These are large sums of taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
        <P>There was much debate in this House when we introduced the bank guarantee scheme and on recapitalisation of the banks.  The biggest issue on the European plain is the Greek crisis, whether it will default, be forced out of the eurozone, what will be the future of the economic and monetary union if this happened and what would be the future of the European Union yet not once has the Government seen fit to come into this House or the Seanad and share with us its views or those expressed by other members states, in particular eurozone member states, on this issue, which is totally unacceptable.  Parliament has a responsibility to hold Government accountable, as provided for in the Constitution, of which I am sure Deputy Mansergh is well aware.  He also knows well that the Lisbon treaty places new requirements on every member state, irrespective of whether they have a constitution like ours, to hold their governments accountable for the decisions they make, yet we have not had the slightest opportunity to hold our Government to account.  We are now pretty much faced with a <i>fait accompli</i> .  This has been agreed by all countries, including Ireland.  All that is required of us now is that we put our stamp on it.  While I accept it is right that we put our stamp on it, this might not be the stamp we would put on it had we been consulted on the matter.</P>
        <P>We are elected by the people to represent them in this House and to ensure that the Government, when it goes abroad, reflects in its decisions the views of this House.  One cannot have a purely executive Government that operates on its own.  I believe that this business shows a lack of respect for all things European and a lack of structures in both Houses for dealing with matters European.  The manner in which the Executive behaves is totally contrary to the degree of integration that has taken place between the various states of the European Union, through various treaties since the Maastricht treaty in 1992.   That is one of the fall-outs from this decision.  It is hoped that the Taoiseach will, rather than expect us to quickly enact legislation within a day and a half, following which he will attend the next summit in Europe and sign up to what he wishes, address this House and keep us informed about what is going on.  This is not how these matters can be addressed in the future.  We will make bad decisions if this is what we continue to do.</P>
        <P>Tonight is the first occasion on which we had an opportunity to discuss this matter.  We will, as a Parliament, have to put our foot down to ensure this does not happen again in response to future crises.  We understand that crises occur.  Members should recall this started as &euro;500 million euro before rising to &euro;750 million and then to &euro;1.3 billion.  The legislation now refers to a maximum of &euro;1.5 billion although, at the same time, the stabilisation mechanism will increase the figure further to &euro;7.22 billion.  Moreover, all this is happening at a time when we are tightening our own belt.</P>
        <P>My concern is that the proposed measures are very harsh on Greece and others have questioned whether Greece has the requisite ability, given its narrow base.  The main focus is on <Col N="308"/>taking money out of the economy by taking it out of people&rsquo;s pensions and payroll and by levying excise duties and VAT, all of which will greatly restrict the ability of the ordinary Greek citizen to make ends meet.  The danger is that unless this is combined with a stimulus package to create jobs that will put money into their pockets and into the economy, we will be going down the wrong road.</P>
        <P>I refer to the communication received recently from the Commission.  Incidentally, the Commission does not appear to have recognised that it must now include all member state parliaments among the bodies to which it sends its communications.  Neither this Parliament nor any other was included.  The aforementioned communication appears to be going down the fiscal road solely, without consideration for the other requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Costello and the Labour Party for sharing time.  While in Barry McGuigan mode, I also thank the Minister and his officials for the briefing on this Bill last week, which I found to be useful.  In addition, I regret my absence from the Chamber when the Minister for Finance made his contribution.  I was caught in the Select Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment where I was moving amendments to a Bill in my name.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Were this Bill intended to fund essential public services in Greece for its people, I would have no problem with it.  Were it aimed at providing a stimulus package to working people in Greece to try to build their way out of the economic mess, again I would have no problem with it because helping neighbours was part of the culture in which I, in common with many other Members, was reared.  One always helped one&rsquo;s neighbour in times of need.  That is not the purpose of this Bill.  It is about bailing out international bondholders who are a very wealthy, elite group of people.  To describe this measure as a way of helping neighbours in Greece is to mislead entirely the public and this House.  This Bill is about the direct provision of funding to bondholders, the majority of which are German banks.  If one opposes a bailout for bankers in Ireland, surely it similarly must be opposed at an international level.  These bondholders operate within the market, which I always took to mean taking one&rsquo;s chances.  Why is no risk or chance left to bondholders?  Why must taxpayers and poor people in such economies pick up the tab when the market goes wrong for these people?  Someone should provide Members with the answers.</P>
        <P>As I noted, this primarily affects German banks.  I was disappointed with the analysis of this situation by the Labour Party and Fine Gael as Opposition parties and their failure to perceive that it is just as problematic to bail out German bankers and others as it is to bail out Irish bankers.  I consider it to be the same.  This pertains to the market and, if it fails, that is the job they are in.  There should not be an absolute guarantee for those in this wealthy club that ordinary people will carry the can for them at all times.  This is completely unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The perfect example in this regard took place in this State in the 2010 budget last December when the wrong option was taken.  The Government was faced with a number of options in respect of how to build our way out of this recession.  It took the wrong option because it opted for fleecing public servants, cutting pensioners&rsquo; Christmas bonuses and all the rest that went with it instead of going the other way and building a stimulus package.  It did so instead of introducing a wealth tax or borrowing some money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to kick-start the economy.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s pre-budget submission, the Road to Recovery, outlined in a detailed and costed fashion how that option would work, and it is most unfortunate this did not happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is demanded of Greece that its economy be hamstrung by pay cuts and job losses and that it should service a now increased level of debt.  Deputy Costello was correct when he made a <Col N="309"/>similar point.  Reducing incomes while increasing debt only enhances the risk of default and, hence, yields will continue to rise and the international bondholders again will have a field day.  A crucial yet completely ignored point from Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s when downgrading Greek and Portuguese debt was that the austerity measures have depressed activity and tax revenues.  This is the complete opposite of what people should seek to achieve.  One should seek to generate additional incomes and try to ensure people have sufficient funds to stimulate the economy and keep economic activity going.  Instead, this Bill proposes the complete opposite and takes a slash and burn approach.  While the latter phrase is a clich&eacute;, it is correct in this case.  It is known that such measures are counter-productive because when budget deficits consequently increase, the rate of interest and so on rises and Government debt becomes more expensive.  This is crazy.</P>
        <P>The European Commission obviously is seeking to have a veto &mdash; I acknowledge it is called consultation at present but will, of course, end up as a veto &mdash; in respect of national budgets in the member states, which is completely wrong.  Incidentally, Sinn F&eacute;in warned during the course of the Lisbon treaty debate that this is exactly what would happen.  Moreover, the Lisbon treaty facilitated this taking place.  I also seek an explanation from the Government on its exact attitude in respect of going to the European Commission and meeting other finance ministers of the eurozone states in particular to discuss the implications in this regard.</P>
        <P>Members will have seen the substantial dip in the value of the euro but it certainly has not collapsed or anything like that.  Arguably, a weaker euro constitutes a substantial economic advantage by virtue of the export opportunities it gives both to this State and throughout the eurozone.  I acknowledge the European Central Bank has primary responsibility for the euro.  It is most unfortunate that when evaluating from an Opposition perspective what is good for the Irish people and economy, Ireland&rsquo;s economy is approached in one way, but when it comes to dealing with Greece and this bailout for international bondholders, a completely different approach is taken.  I hope this can be explained in the coming days.</P>
        <P>One way to reduce the volume of financial transactions that are taking place as markets take advantage and attack the euro&rsquo;s position is the introduction of a tax on such financial transfers.  The Tobin tax, which has been mooted many times, proposes the levying of a marginal percentage of a cost on financial transactions, which would eliminate the benefit to spectators in attacking the euro.  I do not understand the reason this is not a central part of debate and discussion throughout the eurozone.  I have not heard it being mooted substantially since the onset of this crisis, which is most unfortunate as it is a simple, low-cost and effective measure to prevent speculators from attacking currencies and the euro in particular in the manner that obtains at present.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for selecting this issue for discussion.  It is an important issue both nationally and locally.</P>
        <P>I was appalled recently at a health board meeting when I was informed that in County Mayo, there will now be a review of home help hours.  As soon as I heard that, I said to the officials that a review means there will be cuts.  I have since read in the newspapers that they are now deciding how carers should look after someone, how much time they can spend with those they <Col N="310"/>look after and how while they are being asked to do an impossible job, they will be timed by the health services.  We are not dealing with animals &mdash; we are dealing with people &mdash; and they cannot be timed.</P>

        <P>How can a person in need of a home help be treated like this?  This is the lowest blow this Government has struck since it came into office.  There is no doubt the recent cutbacks have been hurtful and severe but this is the lowest of the low.  I am surprised Fianna F&aacute;il would do this to the most vulnerable in society, those who need help most.</P>
        <P>I would not mind but home helps save the State a huge amount.  If it was not for those who come into people&rsquo;s homes to give them a bit of support and backup, they would need to be in full-time care and would cost the State much more.  Home help is the greatest scheme ever introduced.  It has worked well but timing home helps &mdash; how fast they can get someone&rsquo;s breakfast and clean up their house &mdash; is inhuman.  I am surprised any Minister, any Government or any politician of any party could stand over this and allow the HSE to do it.</P>
        <P>I am saying to the Government tonight that this will be fought every step of the way.  In my own county of Mayo, there is talk that they will take away 50,000 home help hours.  We are a broad constituency, the third largest county in the country, with rural areas where people are very scattered.  They depend on the home help service.</P>
        <P>The person who contacted me is looked after by a home help who works beyond the call of duty.  On one occasion, the home help came in when she was off duty.  She gets tea for this person and painted the house and did not want to be paid for it; she wanted to help.  The person, however, was delighted to have the home help hours.</P>
        <P>This is an outrageous attack on the elderly and I am surprised the Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party are letting this happen.  I say shame on the Minister for Health and Children, because this is the lowest blow of all.  I say to the HSE that surely to God there must be another way for it to make savings.  It is not long since it was spending money in my county on conferences to make sure the budget for the year was spent.  I say shame on them to the HSE and the Minister.  They should stay away from the home helps, the old, the weak and the sick.  If they must make cuts, they better make them somewhere else.</P>
        <P>If the Government can find money for the banks and for everyone else, we must find it for the home helps because this is the greatest attack I have seen by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party on rural life, rural people and particularly the elderly.  All I can say is shame on Fianna F&aacute;il, it has gone to the lowest of the low.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Ring for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to update the House on Government policy on the home help service specifically, and community services generally, for older people.</P>
        <P>The guiding principle of Government policy in this area is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  This is realised through a range of community-based supports such as home help, home care packages, meals-on-wheels and day and respite care.</P>
        <P>The importance attached to these services is highlighted by the fact that between 2006 and 2010, over &euro;200 million additional funding was provided to the HSE to develop such supports for older people.  Without these initiatives, many older people would spend longer than necessary in acute hospitals, or would be admitted to residential care earlier than might be required. <Col N="311"/> Home care services are provided either directly by the HSE or in partnership with the community and voluntary sector, or by arrangement with private providers.</P>
        <P>Despite the serious economic constraints experienced in recent times, we have continued to prioritise improving community services for older people.  This is reflected in the &euro;10 million additional funding provided in the last budget, to expand home care packages nationally.  These packages often contain a significant home help component.</P>
        <P>The HSE national service plan 2010, which was approved by the Minister for Health and Children last March, commits the executive to providing almost 12 million home help hours to over 54,000 people.  With reference to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the national target for 2010 for home help hours is unchanged from the 2009 figure.  The HSE has, therefore, formally committed to delivering this year effectively the same number of home help hours as were provided in 2009.  Any change to this commitment would have to be notified to the Department.</P>
        <P>In addition to the mainstream home help provision, the current service plan is designed to deliver home care packages to around 9,600 people at any one time, or to some 13,000 clients over the course of the year.  This represents an increase for this particular initiative over last year.  The plan also provides for 21,300 day care places, which should facilitate an estimated 80,000 people.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Other important initiatives in relation to home care supports are also being undertaken at a strategic level.  Arising from an evaluation of home care packages, commissioned by the Department of Health and Children and published in December last, the HSE established a task group to progress this year various improvements in home care provision, including the delivery of home care packages, the allocation of home help hours, and the procurement of home care services generally.  The various guidelines now being prepared are intended to allow the HSE adopt a more standardised approach nationally to the provision of home care services, including home help.  The draft guidelines will have to be considered by senior management in the HSE, and will be submitted to the Department of Health and Children for consideration.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services.  The Deputy will appreciate that decisions in the area of home care have to be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures.  The executive has been asked to make a rigorous examination of how existing funding might be re-configured or re-allocated to ensure maximum service provision is achieved.  This requires a stringent ongoing review of the application of the resources currently available.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, due to the current industrial action, this is the most up to date information available to me.  I regret that I do not have any more information at present but if the Deputy wishes to raise this matter again once the current industrial action has ended, I will endeavour to have the matter re-examined at that stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already expressed in the House today my condolences to the family of Daniel McAnaspie on his tragic death and I repeat those condolences.  It is particularly appalling that almost three months after he went missing, his remains were found in a ditch at the side of a field in County Meath.  I am very conscious that a Garda murder investigation is under way and I do not want to say anything that could in any way prejudice that investigation.  I hope, as no doubt do all other Members of the House, that those responsible for his appallingly violent death are brought to justice in the not too distant future.</P><Col N="312"/>
        <P>I met the family of Daniel McAnaspie shortly after he went missing and they were greatly concerned about him.  They told me the story of his dealings with the HSE and their concerns about the manner in which he had been failed by the HSE.  This was a troubled young man who suffered from dyslexia, who had learning difficulties and who was an orphan.  He was in the care system and he was supposed to be properly provided for by the HSE.  At various stages, his family did their best to be of help to him.</P>
        <P>From the information I have, it is my understanding that having been in care, he returned to live with an aunt for a period of approximately two years.  Having attended a special school, my information is that his movement out of care to reside with the aunt resulted in the place that had been available to him in the special school ceasing to be available.  At a time when this child had particular needs, the lack of co-ordination between the HSE and the Department of Education and Science within the care services added to the difficulties of this family in caring for this troubled young man at home.</P>
        <P>The HSE failed to provide the supports required.  The HSE also failed to provide the special facilities needed to meet his very special needs.  I am still not sure why that occurred.  Clearly there were substantial failings.  This is the second young person to have been murdered when under the care of the HSE, as far as we know.  Melissa Mahon is another young person who was murdered while supposedly in care.  It may well be that additional numbers of young people will be revealed to have died while in care when the group that the Minister appointed finally undertakes the work assigned to it and when it reports.</P>
        <P>With regard to Daniel McAnaspie, I call on the Minister of State to ensure that there is a full independent inquiry into all of the dealings by the HSE with this tragic young man and his family.  I also call on the Minister of State to appoint individuals entirely independent of the HSE to conduct such an inquiry without delay.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that such an inquiry is not delayed until the completion of the Garda investigation and the taking of any prosecution that may ensue from such investigation.  There is no reason the inquiry should not commence at an early stage.</P>
        <P>The inquiry should involve not just a review of the files and records of the HSE but should include interviews with social work personnel, care workers involved with this young man, and those in managerial positions in the HSE and the educational system who made decisions that impacted on the tragedy of this young man&rsquo;s life.  That independent inquiry should also include interviews with members of Daniel McAnaspie&rsquo;s family, who can very articulately set out their concerns and worries.</P>
        <P>I am fully conscious of the fact that along the route dealing with this tragic young man I am sure there were some dedicated social workers who did their best and tried to ensure the tragedy that has occurred would not occur.  The particular concern I have is that despite everything we have learned in the past ten years, despite the publication of the reports into the deaths of Tracey Fay and David Foley &mdash; two reports which were sitting on the shelves of the HSE and in the Minister of State&rsquo;s office during the crucial year of Daniel McAnaspie&rsquo;s life immediately preceding his death &mdash; we were told lessons were learned from these reports.  The lessons should have been learned 18 months, two years or maybe five years ago.  Certainly, both reports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude with this point.</P><Col N="313"/>
        <P>Both reports were well completed during the time that this young man was still alive when proper provision could have been made for him.  I am sick of hearing the HSE say it will review what occurred to learn what went wrong.  The truth is, and it seems to me, that over the past decade with all the tragedies that have resulted from the gross failures of our child care and protection services, no real lessons have been learned and nothing has changed.  We need this independent investigation so the truth is known as to how this young man was dealt with and what went wrong.  We in this House should then consider the radical changes necessary to ensure we put in place child protection structures that truly protect children.</P>
        <P>The last thing I will say this evening in the restricted time I have is to ask the Minister of State to confirm to the House that before we get to the end of this week three people will be appointed to conduct the inquiry that is necessary and that the results of that inquiry will be fully published.  I ask him to give serious consideration for the first time in the context of an inquiry of this nature to making it a public inquiry.  Let us have full transparency and accountability for the manner in which our child care services are failing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to reply to this Adjournment matter.  The tragic circumstances of the death of Daniel McAnaspie are particularly harrowing and all the more difficult for his family and friends.  As Deputy Shatter mentioned, the case is the subject of a murder investigation being carried out by the Garda and therefore I am limited in what I can say about the specifics of the case.</P>
        <P>Daniel was initially placed in the care of the HSE in 2003 and I understand that efforts were made since 2009 to stabilise his living environment.  The boy went missing on 25 February 2010 and unfortunately his body was identified on 16 May 2010.  The HSE has confirmed that Daniel&rsquo;s case will be reviewed in accordance with the recently published HIQA guidance for the HSE for the review of serious incidents including deaths of children in care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The review will involve a full investigation into the care provided to Daniel McAnaspie and the circumstances leading up to his disappearance and death.  Any concerns raised by family members, and other relevant parties, will be addressed in the course of the review, which will be conducted under an independent chairperson.  The review into Daniel McAnaspie death will commence without delay, with a review team of three members, external to the HSE, drawn from a national review panel soon to be finalised.  The primacy of the Garda investigation will need to be taken into account by the review group.  It should be noted that I wrote to the HSE&rsquo;s assistant national director for children and families on 25 March, when it was reported that the child was missing, requesting that a review under the HIQA guidance commence.</P>
        <P>The HIQA guidance was produced in response a commitment in the Government&rsquo;s implementation plan following the publication of the Ryan report.  I recently established the independent review group on child deaths.  The group has been asked to examine existing information on deaths of children in care over the past ten years so as to validate the categorisation of those children who died from natural causes.  The group is to examine existing reviews and reports completed by the HSE, or by others on behalf of the HSE, on children other than those who died from natural causes and based upon this information, provide an overall report for publication.  The group&rsquo;s report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published.  The case of Daniel McAnaspie will be notified to the group.</P>
        <P>The HSE is committed to a comprehensive review of Daniel&rsquo;s care to be undertaken in line with the guidance from HIQA so that any lessons can be learned in terms of the provision of services to young people in care.  Deputy Shatter mentioned there may be more than 23 cases, which is the figure I mentioned in the D&aacute;il earlier this year, and this is probably true.  Part of <Col N="314"/>this is associated with the widening of the ambit of the review to include those children notified to the child protection system but not in care as well as children who have already left the care system but are under the age of 21.  This is not the only reason I dare say that the numbers may increase; it may also be due to poor record keeping on the part of the HSE.  Nevertheless, this is a very challenging area and I believe the changes we introduced since the implementation plan following the Ryan report will bring transparency to this crucial area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office for permission to bring this matter to the floor of the House.  This matter concerns employees of Alienware, which is in Athlone.  It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dell, a fact I and the employees have ascertained.  I understand a member of the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s party who is an MEP has been very helpful with regard to the European globalisation fund.  A particular block of money was produced to deal with employees of Alienware.  The employees wish to know how they can participate in the European globalisation fund awarded to Dell.</P>
        <P>Alienware is slowly decreasing its employee numbers.  Many have left and many others are to go.  The entire exodus will be completed within a few months, which is a very sad event in the town.  It was a small manufacturing company doing very good work and had a very good market.</P>
        <P>As it is a wholly-owned subsidiary the employees cannot ascertain what is their position with regard to participation in the European globalisation fund.  They cannot get any answers from Dell, even though Dell owns the company.  They are listening to half-stories and stories so I thought the only way I could get clarification, if such clarification is evident in a matter such as this, was to bring it to the floor of the House so we would know exactly what is the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coghlan.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the redundancies last year and this year at the Alienware company which is located in Athlone.  I understand that this company, which is an Irish limited company, is a subsidiary of the Dell Corporation, as Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke has pointed out.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation received notification from Alienware on 1 April 2009 of an impending 57 redundancies at its plant in Athlone over an 18-month period.</P>
        <P>It was clear from the notification and from subsequent inquiries made by officials of the Department at the time that, although linked to the Dell Corporation, the redundancies at Alienware were not directly linked to the 1,900 redundancies announced by Dell at its computer manufacturing facility in Raheen, County Limerick in January 2009.  The subsequent application for European Union co-financing assistance made by Ireland under the European globalisation adjustment fund, EGF, was made specifically in regard to the Raheen redundancies.</P>
        <P>Alienware is a distinct company and its business activity is in an area completely separate from that of the type of computer manufacture carried out at the Raheen plant.  I understand that Alienware is involved in high-end computer gaming machines and systems.  The rationale for the redundancies, as notified to the Department in April 2009 by the management, was one of infrastructural change to support the company&rsquo;s expansion and the streamlining of its operations by reducing costs to improve business efficiencies.</P><Col N="315"/>
        <P>Strict criteria apply to the making of applications for co-financing assistance under the EGF regulation.  The fund can provide supports where redundancies in a European Union member state result from trade related reasons.  These reasons include delocalisation of production outside the European Union, a substantial increase of imports into the European Union or the rapid decline of the European Union share of the global market for a given sector.  The EGF does not, however, provide supports in the case of a company restructuring or rationalisation such as that in the Alienware situation.</P>
        <P>Applications must encompass a minimum number of 500 redundancies occurring within a four-month period in the case of a single enterprise fund.  It is understood that Alienware was proposing up to 57 redundancies in a timeframe between April 2009 and October 2010.  These criteria clearly militated against any application being pertinent to the case of the redundancies occurring at Alienware.  Additional redundancies within the Dell company in other Irish locations have occurred since the redundancies at the Raheen plant which also were not eligible for EGF support.</P>
        <P>Beyond the prescribed limits of EGF support, the Government continues to provide a wide and varied range of supports in terms of guidance, job search, upskilling, retraining, enterprise supports and educational opportunities for all redundant persons.  These supports are delivered through the services of State agencies such as F&Aacute;S, the vocational education committees, Enterprise Ireland, the city and county enterprise boards and various educational institutions.  The Government remains fully committed to upskilling the unemployed in order that they are successful in getting back into employment.</P>
        <P>We are investing substantial resources in tackling our unemployment problem.  This year more than &euro;1 billion will be invested in the provision of a range of labour force measures.  We are focusing our resources on a number of key cohorts of the unemployed which include the lower skilled, the long-term unemployed, those under 35 years of age, and those formerly employed in the manufacturing, construction and retail sectors.  These cohorts have been prioritised as they are most likely to drift into very long-term unemployment.</P>
        <P>In 2009 F&Aacute;S employment services, together with the local employment services, doubled their capacity.  This means that the annual referral capacity under the national employment action plan rose from 78,000 persons in 2008 to 147,000 persons last year.  The additional resources allocated by the Government to tackling the rising unemployment rate have also enabled the significant expansion of activation, training and work experience places.  This year the total number of training and work experience activation places will be approximately 147,000 compared with the 66,000 places that were delivered in 2008 and the 130,000 places delivered last year.  The bulk of this additional provision has been due to the increase in training places on short courses for the unemployed.  F&Aacute;S now provides modular based training in order that participants can pick which modules they most require to improve their skills and increase their employability while maintaining a close link to the labour market.</P>
        <P>Training courses are being delivered in innovative formats such as on-line, blended learning and night courses.  In this way we are providing a range of delivery methods in addition to the traditional classroom approach, which enables more people access the services of F&Aacute;S.  In addition to the places mentioned, Skillnets and F&Aacute;S will provide this year almost 10,400 training places for the unemployed or those on short-time working.  Owing to the economic downturn, many individuals work for two or three days each week and receive social welfare payments for the days they do not work.  Skillnets and F&Aacute;S provide training opportunities for these people.  Individuals participating in these programmes can avail of training for the days they do not work while retaining their social welfare entitlements, subject to the normal social <Col N="316"/>welfare rules applying.  This means these individuals are able to use their reduced working week as an opportunity to upskill, thereby improving their employability.</P>
  
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Government is acutely aware of the large numbers of people under 25 years of age who are unemployed.  That is why the Government has decided this cohort will receive priority access to the State&rsquo;s supports for the unemployed, such as F&Aacute;S employment and training services.  F&Aacute;S has been asked to make significant prioritisation of services for those under 25 years of age a key element in its provision in 2010.  An initiative has been put in place to immediately activate 18 and 19 year olds instead of waiting the usual three months for this automatic activation.</P>
        <P>The main specific provision for early school leavers continues to be training at community training centres and vocational education committees under the Youthreach programme.  The Government is maintaining the 6,000 places available in this programme at a cost of approximately &euro;110 million.  Another important initiative which would be of particular relevance to this cohort is the work placement programmewhich has 2,000 places, of which 1,000 are for graduates.  Participants on the programme gain work experience for a period of up to nine months and may retain their social welfare entitlements, subject to the normal social welfare rules applying.  This work experience will significantly improve their chances of securing paid employment in future.</P>
        <P>The Government has implemented a variety of measures which will support around 4,000 redundant apprentices to progress their apprenticeships.  These measures include a new &euro;4 million redundant apprentices placement scheme for up to 750 apprentices participating in on-the-job training at phases 3 and 5, agreeing with ESB Networks to take on 400 redundant apprentices at phases 5 and 7 over a period of 18 months, amending the rules for off-the-job training to facilitate redundant apprentices to progress their apprenticeship, and the provision by the institutes of technology of a programme for redundant apprentices which will provide them with a level 5 FETAC award which allows for access and transfer of credits to other post-apprenticeship programmes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The education sector has been very proactive in responding to the need for increased offerings for the unemployed.  This can clearly be seen in the significant increase in the number of back to education allowance recipients which has increased to more than 18,000, many of whom are participating in further and higher education programmes.  In the further education sector this year an estimated 126,000 learners will benefit from part-time learning opportunities for the low skilled, the disadvantaged and the unemployed.  A total of 40,000 learners will benefit from full-time further education opportunities under Youthreach, the vocational training opportunities scheme and the post-leaving certificate programme.  These programmes are targeted at the unemployed or are specifically designed to enhance participants&rsquo; employability.</P>
        <P>There is clear evidence which shows that increasing numbers of people are choosing to pursue third and fourth level education.  This is a welcome trend at a time of reduced opportunity for school leavers entering into the labour market.  The total number of full-time enrolments in universities and institutes of technology is projected to be more than 140,000 for this academic year, an increase of 4.5% on the last academic year.</P>
        <P>The Government has also created a &euro;20 million labour market activation fund to support innovative proposals over and above mainstream provision for the unemployed.  Several hundred proposals from the public, private, community and voluntary sectors are being assessed <Col N="317"/>and it is expected this fund will provide at least 3,500 training places this year.  The activation fund targets the low skilled and those formerly employed in declining sectors such as the construction, retail and manufacturing sectors, with a particular focus on those aged under 35 and those unemployed for more than one year.  Successful proposals will be those that can show they will provide the unemployed with skills that are in demand to enable them secure employment or to progress them on the pathway to employment.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s core strategy in this area is one of creating jobs, supporting enterprises, protecting vulnerable jobs and providing the unemployed with upskilling opportunities to get them into employment as soon as possible.  While EGF supports cannot be provided in the particular instance of the redundancies occurring at Alienware, I hope I have highlighted the wide range of alternative national supports which exist. I urge all those currently unemployed, including those at Alienware, to avail of these supports as appropriate.  I thank the Deputy once again for raising this matter.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important issue in the parish of Herbertstown.  On behalf of the board of management, principal and staff of Herbertstown national school I ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills to sanction a devolved grant to enable the board of management to build an additional classroom, learning support room, general purpose room, staff room and office.  This will enable the school to deal with the planned expansion in its number of pupils.</P>
        <P>It is a rural school that was built in 1943.  It has three classrooms and a prefabricated section which is 20 years old.  It is divided into three sections.  One is used by the day resource teacher, one by the learning support teacher and the other as a library and storage facility.  While the boys have a cloakroom, the girls must use the corridor for their coats, sporting gear, bags, shoes and other personal effects because the original girls&rsquo; cloakroom is used as an office.  It has been converted to facilitate photocopying, filing cabinets and other office equipment.  The room also stores art and crafts supplies, mathematics equipment and other teaching supports.  It is unsuitable for storing confidential files and reports.</P>
        <P>The school enrolment in September 2009 was 70 pupils.  It has applications to enrol 82 pupils for September 2010.  These numbers will entitle the school to an extra mainstream teacher for 2011.  There are still more enrolment forms outstanding so it is possible that the extra mainstream teacher may be appointed in September 2010.  As well as an increase in the pupils numbers, there is enrolment for a junior infant pupil with autism in September 2010.  The school will apply, therefore, for a full-time support resource officer, which will create a need for a new staff room and toilet facilities to accommodate the extra staff.  There is no accommodation for the new mainstream teacher or a full-time learning support resource teacher.  The school has no indoor facilities for physical education for the children and, with the present emphasis on PE in the new curriculum, this is not acceptable and is unfair on the children.</P>
        <P>I commend the board of management, principal and staff on their excellent educational facilities in the current conditions.  Pressure will come with the expansion of numbers and needs of the school.  Will the T&aacute;naiste sanction a devolved grant to enable the board of management to build an additional classroom, learning support room, general purpose room, staff room and office?  An adequate site is available on the school grounds to facilitate this development, so no site purchase is necessary.  I urge the Minister to take our proposal seriously.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan.  I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position on Herbertstown national school.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in the existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  The Deputy will appreciate that the extent of the demand on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget is enormous, providing, as it does, accommodation for new communities, additional accommodation for extra teachers which the Government has put into the system and modernising existing schools.  However, huge inroads have been made in addressing those needs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the allocation for school buildings in 2010 is approximately &euro;579 million, which represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding for the building programme, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the very real commitment of the Government to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.  However, the level of demand on the Department&rsquo;s resources is such that all projects cannot be carried out together.  They will have to be carried out over time in a structured and coherent manner and that is the reasoning behind the Department&rsquo;s published prioritisation criteria.</P>
        <P>Turning to Herbertstown national school in particular, the Deputy will be aware that this school&rsquo;s staffing complement comprises a principal, two mainstream teachers, one shared learning support teacher and one part-time resource teacher.  As Deputy Neville pointed out, the school&rsquo;s current accommodation consists of three permanent classrooms and temporary accommodation which is used for resource teaching.  The school made an application for additional accommodation, consisting of a classroom, learning support room, office, GP room, staff room and toilets.  I am pleased to advise that the school was approved a devolved grant to build an additional two classrooms to meet the school&rsquo;s most immediate needs.  The school was advised of that by letter on 7 May 2010.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  I assure him that the T&aacute;naiste is committed to meeting the needs of schools such as Herbertstown national school as resources allow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 61 and 128 together.</P>
        <P>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, <i>A Fair Deal</i>, commenced on the 27th October 2009.  Its purpose is to equalise State support for public and private nursing home residents, and to offer assurance to one of the most vulnerable groups in society &mdash; those in need of long-term <Col N="320"/>nursing home care &mdash; that care will be affordable and will remain affordable for as long as they need it.</P>
        <P>Under the <i>Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009</i>, the HSE has statutory authority for administering the scheme.  Applications are processed in accordance with the Act and the HSE&rsquo;s Guidelines on the Standardised Implementation of the Scheme which were approved by the Minister for Health and Children.  This framework ensures a consistent approach across the HSE to the processing of applications.</P>
        <P>Since the introduction of the scheme, the HSE has been dealing with a large volume of applications from both existing residents and new entrants. The HSE estimates that it has received over 9,000 applications and that it has processed over half of these to date.  In addition over 1,400<b> </b>applications for Ancillary State support have been received, of which over 600 have been completed.  The HSE estimates that approximately 50 applications for State support have been refused on the basis that the applicant&rsquo;s assessed means exceeded the cost of care.  Finally, the HSE informs me that an extremely small number of applications have been refused on the grounds that the applicant was assessed as not needing long-term nursing home care.</P>
        <P>The normal timelines for processing applications and making a determination regarding financial support vary according to individual circumstances and complexities. It has taken longer than normal to process applications to date because of the large initial volume of applications received following the introduction of the new scheme. This should improve once the scheme has settled down.</P>
        <P>However, I wish to emphasise that any delay in processing applications should not impact negatively on individuals due to the safeguards provided within the primary legislation.</P>
        <P>The legislation provides that applicants who were in nursing home care on the date the scheme commenced shall have their State support backdated to that date.  Furthermore, anyone who was in receipt of subvention prior to the commencement of the scheme continues to have their subvention paid while their application is being processed. Once their application has been determined, the backdated State support will be netted off against the subvention already paid. In practice, what this means is that people will not be paid twice for the same care but will have State support under the new scheme paid from the 27th October 2009.</P>
        <P>For new entrants to nursing home care after the 27th October 2009, financial support will be paid either from the date that the application was made or from date of admission to the nursing home, whichever is the later.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, due to the current industrial action, this is the most up to date information available to me.  I regret that I do not have any more information at present but if the Deputies wishes to raise this matter again once the current industrial action has ceased, I will endeavour to have the matter re-examined at that stage.</P>

	<P>Dementia is a most distressing condition and presents a significant and growing challenge to health and social services. Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease represents about 70% of the cases of dementia. </P><Col N="321"/>
        <P>People nowadays live longer and as a consequence are more likely to develop dementia or Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. While dementia is not solely related to age, it does affect 5% of people over 65 years with the figure rising to 20% for people over 80 years of age.</P>
        <P>Research and published work on dementia has outlined the complexity and range of issues involved in the effective management of dementia. This work also emphasises the need for co-ordinated, multi-layered and well-resourced services, which are responsive to the individual needs of people with dementia and of those who care for them.</P>
        <P>Over the past number of years there has been continued development of community-based services for older persons. This is reflected in the unprecedented levels of investment in this sector &mdash; over &euro;200 million additional funding has been provided for new service developments in recent years. These developments include community nursing, paramedical services, home help services and support to family carers.  In tandem there have been significant developments, both nationally and internationally, in the diagnosis and treatment of dementia, and in the development of services to meet the needs of people with dementia and their families.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the growing importance of these conditions, particularly in light of current demographic trends, the Department of Health and Children has started the process of developing a strategy on dementia that will support the delivery of long-term care services having regard to future demographic trends and the consequential increase in demand for long-term care.</P>
        <P>The strategy will be developed on the basis of the best evidence available from national and international sources. We are now in discussions with relevant stakeholder groups on the first stage of the process. This will be a research phase to include relevant information on current prevalence and future trends in dementia, as well as international strategies and developments, including their outcomes and evaluations. Once this is completed and available my Department will use it as a framework to develop a national strategy.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest> if she will provide details on the hospital accident and emergency units that will close or limit opening hours as a result of health service cutbacks; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year, the HSE dealt with nearly 1.2 million Emergency Department presentations and it expects to do the same again this year. About 70% of people who attended Emergency Departments last year were not admitted to hospital: they were treated and discharged. This year, the HSE is planning to increase the number who can be safely discharged home without admission to about 72%. This can be achieved by changing the way services are provided, including by providing quicker access to senior clinical decisions makers.</P>
        <P>I am determined to move to a consultant provided, rather than a consultant led, service where consultants work on a team basis. As a result, and following agreement in 2008 on a new consultant contract, I have made it clear to the HSE that it needs to increase the number of consultants and reduce the number of NCHDs to achieve a more appropriate balance between both groups.</P>
        <P>I am also determined to support the changes in NCHD training status and associated medical registration status being introduced by the Medical Council under the Medical Practitioners Act.</P><Col N="322"/>
        <P>I have been advised that there are likely to be difficulties in filling some NCHD posts when doctors begin their next rotation in early July. The indications are that there will be a reduction in the number of applications for certain NCHD posts, especially in posts which are not part of a formal training rotation scheme and in the areas of emergency medicine, anaesthesia and general medicine. However, the extent of any shortfall will only become evident over the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>It is because of the expected reductions in applications for some NCHD posts, and not because of any budgetary challenge, that the HSE is currently examining how best to maintain and improve the quality of services provided to patients attending Emergency Departments.</P>
        <P>A range of possible measures are being examined including some relating to recruitment and training status. Other important measures include reductions in tiered on-call and improved cross-cover arrangements. Instead of cases being referred through successive tiers of doctors, we need to increase the extent to which consultants and other senior clinical decision makers respond to urgent or emergency cases.</P>
        <P>Because we are serious about patient safety, we also have to ensure that complex acute care &mdash; particularly for emergency medicine, critical care and complex surgery &mdash; is provided in hospitals with a sufficiently high volume of activity to ensure the clinicians providing those services can maintain their skills. However, quality care also means accessible care and I am equally determined to ensure that the vast majority of people attending Emergency Departments, who require relatively straightforward levels of urgent care, can continue to receive this care locally.</P>
        <P>The changes I have outlined are driven by concerns about patient safety, quality of care and financial sustainability, not by immediate budgetary issues. They are the right changes for patients &mdash; people want to access care as close to home as possible but also want to be sure they are getting safe high-quality care.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest> if she is satisfied with the Health Service Executive collection and reporting of outpatient waiting lists; the action she will take to improve outpatient reporting and communication between hospitals and general practitioners on outpatient waiting lists; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The improvement of access to outpatient services, which are a key access point to the acute hospital system and involve over three million attendances annually, is a priority for the health service.  It is essential that people are afforded timely access to outpatient services when they require them and that these services function effectively as part of an integrated acute hospital and primary care system.</P>
        <P>The HSE is engaged in a number of measures to improve access to and the efficiency of outpatient services.   The principal aims of the National Outpatient Department Service Improvement Programme are to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Increase the number of new patients seen</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Reduce the numbers who do not attend for scheduled appointments (DNAs)</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Reduce waiting times for patients and</P><Col N="323"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Ensure that all patients are seen within 30 minutes of their appointment time.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The HSE&rsquo;s 2010 National Service Plan contains performance targets for OPD services of a 1:2 new-to-return ratio and a non-attendance rate of not more than 10%.  In its Service Plan, at my request, the HSE has also committed to work on the development of new indicators, in conjunction with National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), to measure median waiting time from:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />GP referral to attendance at outpatient</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Outpatient attendance to admission where this is indicated, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />GP referral to hospital admission.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Outpatient waiting list data is currently collected primarily at individual hospital level.  The HSE is therefore working to develop a system which, on a national basis, will provide standardised and comparable national outpatient waiting list data by hospital and specialty.  The availability of such information will facilitate clinicians and health service managers in further improving the performance of outpatient services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>This year, the HSE is required to achieve a net reduction of 1,520 (or 1.4%) in its employment levels. Corresponding reductions will be required in 2011 and 2012 to achieve an overall reduction of 6,000 between March 2009 and December 2012. These reductions are an essential and unavoidable part of the measures being taken by the Government to address the gap between revenue and expenditure.</P>
        <P>While there is provision in the HSE&rsquo;s Employment Control Framework for some exemptions and exceptions these are limited because of the need to achieve the required payroll savings.  The alternative would be to reduce services in order to secure the necessary expenditure reductions which I assume the Deputy would not favour.</P>
        <P>I recognise that the employment controls introduced by the Government will obviously impact on newly qualified nurses.  However, the only way to ensure we have a sustainable health service in the future is to take firm action now to address the budgetary imbalance.</P>

	<P>The key priorities in relation to services for older people in recent times have been the introduction of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, and the bringing into force of new regulatory standards for the long-term residential care sector.</P><Col N="324"/>
        <P>In tandem with these initiatives for the residential sector, various aspects of community based services have also been advanced by the Department and the HSE, including an expansion of Home Care Packages, and the publication in December last of an independent Evaluation of Home Care Packages commissioned by the Department.</P>
        <P>As regards the possible regulation of home care services, the July 2008 Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> the extension of any licensing systems in health care to primary, community and continuing care service.</P>
        <P>More recently, in July 2009 the Law Reform Commission published a consultation paper entitled &ldquo;Legal Aspects of Carers&rdquo;. This considers the legal issues surrounding home care and makes a number of  provisional recommendations in the area of standards and regulations generally, including vetting, training and supervision. It also provisionally recommends giving a function to the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) in relation to professional home care. Any such changes would require primary legislation and detailed stakeholder consultations.</P>
        <P>The Department accepts the need for a more standardised approach to the regulation of home care generally, whether by public or private provision. This year the HSE intends to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />finalise and circulate standardised access and operational guidelines for delivery of Home Care Packages;</P>

	<P>The annual HSE National Service Plan is the primary vehicle through which my Department monitors and evaluates the perform<Col N="325"/>ance of the Executive to ensure that health services are delivered in accordance with Government policy.  My Department is working collaboratively with the HSE to develop and refine performance measures across all service areas matched with timescales to ensure that they are as robust as possible and reflect key priorities and international best practice as well as being comparable both within the EU and further afield.  My Department has an agreed monitoring framework with the HSE and receives detailed comprehensive monthly reports on all aspects of the National Service Plan.  These Performance Reports are published on the HSE&rsquo;s website each month following approval by the HSE Board.  </P>
        <P>I approved the HSE National Service Plan 2010 on 5 February.  In approving the Plan, I highlighted to the HSE the need to deliver, at a minimum, the levels of service set out in the Plan as well as operating within the limits of its Voted allocation of &euro;14.069bn.  The Government made a series of decisions that will reduce HSE costs this year by some &euro;1bn, made up of pay savings of &euro;630m and non-pay savings of &euro;394m.  The latter includes a target of &euro;106m in non-pay economies to be saved by the HSE in 2010, including substantial procurement savings.  I believe this is achievable without affecting client care.</P>
        <P>The Plan commits the HSE to delivering activity levels for 2010 which are broadly in line with 2009 levels.  Notwithstanding the difficult financial environment, the Government has made available additional resources to assist the HSE in responding to priority demographic and other needs and to support ongoing reform of the public health services.  By reducing costs, and reforming the way services are provided, I am confident the HSE will maintain access to services and continue to improve health outcomes for the population.</P>
        <P>Last month I received the second biannual report against the HSE Corporate Plan 2008-2011 which charts progress against desired medium and longer term objectives and priorities as set out in the Corporate Plan and implemented annually through the National Service Plan.  This helps the Department and the HSE to track performance trends across the health sector and to inform future strategic and annual service planning.</P>
        <P>I am determined to do everything possible to protect services for patients, within the resources we have available for health.  To achieve this, staff at all levels will have to work together to deliver services in a more flexible way.  Without that co-operation and flexibility, services for patients cannot be protected.  It is not just for HSE management to protect services: there is a responsibility on everyone involved to deliver services within budget in new ways that will serve patient needs in accordance with international best practice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department and the Health Service Executive recognise the valuable contribution disability service providers make in the West.  We are also very much aware of the challenges service providers are experiencing. In this context, it is very important that all providers work creatively and co-operatively with the HSE to ensure the maintenance of the maximum level of services within the funding resources available.</P><Col N="326"/>
        <P>I have been advised that in 2008 / 2009 there was an ongoing requirement on the HSE to review expenditure across all areas and to ensure that maximum efficiencies were achieved in service delivery. The HSE set targets for all statutory and non-statutory organisations to achieve efficiency targets in both years equal to 1% of their budgets in 2008 and 2% in 2009.</P>
        <P>In the context of the general economic situation and the financial pressure on the disability service budgets in 2009, the HSE requested service providers to review all non-frontline expenditure, in particular staff travel, expenditure on conferences and seminars, advertising and ensuring maximum value from the procurement of goods and services.  There was also a requirement on all providers to review the way in which services are delivered e.g. opportunities for amalgamating services or back office supports, reduction or elimination of expenditure on overtime and/or agency staffing.</P>
        <P>In 2010 there is a requirement to achieve further efficiencies in disability services with the national objective of achieving a minimum of 2% efficiency savings from non frontline services.</P>
        <P>To date, respite services throughout the West are being reviewed on an ongoing basis, and the majority of Local Health Offices have reported that services are being maintained. In all areas, Disability Managers are working closely with agencies to maintain respite at 2009 levels as far as possible, thereby ensuring that those with the most urgent need for respite services are prioritised.</P>
        <P>The HSE is aware that a non-statutory service in Galway has proposals to close two houses as part of a planned reconfiguration of its residential services. This is in line with the current Disability Policy to relocate people to appropriate accommodation. This is an enhanced service and no current service users will be without a service in the future.</P>
        <P>I have not received a report from the HSE about the necessity to cut multidisciplinary therapy posts in any of the Local Health Offices in the West, however I will ask the HSE to contact the Deputy directly on this issue.</P>
        <P>With regard to charges for day services being implemented by non-statutory service providers, the HSE has no evidence that this is happening. However, the Brothers of Charity in Galway are exploring the option of introducing charges for day services but have not introduced such charges as yet. The HSE in Galway will monitor this situation.</P>
        <P>There is no evidence to show that numbers attending day services have decreased in 2010. The HSE will make available additional funding as part of the &euro;19.5m demography funding available nationally to provide additional capacity for new Day, Residential, Respite/PA/Home Support services.  Of the &euro;19.5m allocated nationally, a total of &euro;4.57M has been allocated to develop disability services in the West. This will equate to 24 new residential places, 92 new day places and 32,200 home support hours.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that it will continue to work in partnership with all of the agencies in the West, involving the managers of services where issues arise. This includes engagement regarding their requirements to maintain core service delivery.<b> </b>The HSE accepts that disability service providers in the West are struggling to manage the impact of the service efficiencies it is required to implement as outlined above. The HSE are confident that if services are examined, efficiencies and savings can be sustained without impacting on the provision of basic core services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Integrated Patient Management System (IPMS) is currently in live operation in 26 hospitals and other community centres. The system successfully supports day-to-day patient administrative functions across all these locations as well as a range of clinical functions, which have yet to be more widely deployed.  The HSE has confirmed that the system has proven to be operationally good and extremely reliable and has not suffered implementation difficulties beyond what would normally be expected in relation to any large complex IT system. It continues to be rolled out by the HSE in support of increased integration of services at regional level, which is a key aspect of health service reconfiguration. Regional deployments of the system continue to facilitate the sharing of patient records within each hospital group as an essential element of multi-site delivery of services. </P>
        <P>I have been assured by the HSE that a recent media report claiming that IPMS has been plagued by security flaws and operational problems is completely without foundation.  The report is understood to have been based on a number of HSE internal audits into the operation of IPMS, particularly at two of the HSE&rsquo;s hospitals. The audits did not uncover security deficiencies in the system itself, but did make some recommendations regarding improvements in management and operational procedures, which are being addressed by the HSE.</P>

        <P>I welcome the completion of the process of reading and reporting on x-rays that were previously not read by consultant radiologists at Tallaght Hospital and also the management of GP referral letters at the hospital. No further delayed diagnoses were found other than the two initially identified.

        <P>On the 9th March 2010, the CEO of the Health Service Executive instructed that a review be undertaken into the circumstances that led to, and the subsequent management by Tallaght Hospital of, delays in reporting radiological examinations at the Hospital during the years 2005 to 2009.

	<P>I am pleased to confirm that the national colorectal cancer screening programme will commence in early 2012. A two-year preparatory period started in January 2010. </P>
        <P>The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) has responsibility for the implementation of the screening programme and it is working closely with colleagues across the Health Service Executive on preparations for this.</P>
        <P>Colorectal screening works on two fronts: it provides early detection and therefore earlier and more effective treatment, and it helps to prevent cancer in the first place by detecting pre-cancerous growths such as polyps.</P>
        <P>The screening programme will initially be offered to men and women aged between 60 and 69 years.  There are estimated to be just over 400,000 people in this age group.  The programme will be extended to all those in the 55-74 year age group as logistics and resources allow.</P>
        <P>As part of the two year pre-implementation phase for the programme, the NCSS is undertaking a series of baseline assessment visits nationwide to assess colonoscopy capacity in existing hospital services. Thirty public hospitals expressed an interest in providing colonoscopy services to support a national screening programme and all visits are due for completion by December 2010.</P>
        <P>The NCSS is also currently finalising the job description, training and educational requirements for candidate Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANP). It is intended that ANPs will ultimately be able to perform colonoscopies as part of the national screening programme.</P>
        <P>Colorectal cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among both men and women in Ireland.  Approximately 2,200 new cases are diagnosed and around 1,000 people die from the disease each year.  A successful national colorectal cancer screening programme has the potential to significantly reduce mortality from this cancer.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that work on this important initiative is continuing.</P>

        <P>The HSE plans to recruit a General Manager with responsibility for Galway University Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital. The recruitment of a General Manager with responsibility for the three hospitals this is designed to improve good co-ordination between the hospitals and to improve clinical services for patients across the region.  It is in line with the ongoing process of achieving greater collaboration between Roscommon and Portiuncula in the provision of services, for example, in the re-configuration of the surgical and anaesthetic departments of the two hospitals into a Joint Department of Surgery and Anaesthesia, which is underway.</P>
        <P>The appointment of a General Manager with responsibility for the three hospitals concerned is also in line with the approach on the governance of acute hospitals recommended in the Health Information and Quality Authority&rsquo;s Report on Quality and Safety of Services at the Mid Western Regional Hospital Ennis, which was published in April 2009.  This report identified integrated governance across hospital networks as an important factor in ensuring higher quality services for patients.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 295 together.</P><Col N="330"/>
        <P>The Renewed Programme for Government re-affirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the current co-location programme.</P>
        <P>Preferred bidders have been selected for six co-located projects at Beaumont, Cork University, Limerick Regional, St James&rsquo;s, Sligo and Waterford Regional Hospitals.  Project agreements have been signed for the Beaumont, Cork, Limerick and St James&rsquo;s projects.  Planning permission has been granted for the first three of these projects.  Planning permission has been granted by the local authority for the St James&rsquo;s project but has been appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Two other projects are at earlier stages of the procurement process.</P>
        <P>The co-location programme is a complex public procurement process.  It is a matter for each successful bidder to arrange its finance under the terms of the relevant Project Agreement.  The co-location initiative, like other major projects, has to deal with the changed funding environment.  The HSE is continuing to work with the successful bidders to provide whatever assistance it can to help them advance the projects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE is required to undertake a rigorous value for money assessment of each co-location project. Projects, in order to proceed, must meet a value for money test which accords with a Public Sector Benchmark. This test is then verified by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) which acts as adviser to the Department of Health and Children. The HSE and NDFA have confirmed that the tenders received for the six projects where preferred bidders have been selected accorded with the Public Sector Benchmark.  As they proceed, the projects must continue to demonstrate value for money.</P>
        <P>There is a requirement on each of the preferred bidders to pay a non-refundable deposit to the HSE on the signing of the project agreement.   The intention of this requirement is to allow the HSE to recoup the expenses that it has incurred in this context.</P>
        <P>The Finance Act 2009 provides for the termination of the schemes of capital allowances for private hospitals and certain other health facilities, subject to transitional arrangements for projects already in development.  Provided that a hospital project conforms to the requirements of these transitional arrangements, and otherwise satisfies the general requirements of the scheme of capital allowances, the tax relief will apply.  This includes four of the co-location projects in respect of which planning permission had been approved by 31 December 2009, should they wish to arrange their financing on the basis of the capital allowances scheme.</P>
        <P>No tax expenditure has been incurred so far and none will be incurred until construction is completed and services are opened. The value of the tax relief in each case will depend on the level of qualifying capital expenditure.  I would add that additional revenues will accrue to the Exchequer from the extra activity generated by the construction of the hospitals, the employment arising and the related services provided on which taxes will be paid.</P>
        <P>Arrangements with health insurers will be a matter for the private hospital in each instance.</P>

	<P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted. </P>
        <P>Registration of domestic adoptions is governed by Section 22 of the Adoption Act 1952.  Under that provision, an tArd Chlaraitheoir (Registrar General) is required to maintain a register of domestic adoptions (i.e. adoptions effected in Ireland, regardless of where the adopted person was born).  The register is called the Adopted Children Register.  An index to the register is maintained and can be searched by any person.  Any person may obtain a copy of any entry in the register.  The legislation also provides for an index linking the birth entry in the register of births (in the case of an Irish-born adopted person) with the entry in the Adopted Children Register.  Information from this index may not be given to any person except by order of a court or the Adoption Board. The Adoption Bill 2009, which will consolidate existing adoption legislation, does not seek to make new proposals in this regard.</P>
        <P>Since 2003, when an adoption legislation consultation paper was published by the then Minister for Children, two pieces of legislation were envisaged. The first to provide for the ratification of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption and to make changes to the role and structure of the Adoption Board and the second to provide for a structured and regulated way of providing access to information and contact for those affected by adoption. I indicated during the Committee Stage of the Adoption Bill, 2009, at the Select Committee on Health and Children my intention to bring forward legislation specifically on the issue of information and tracing. The question of introducing these new legislative provisions is under consideration in the context of the complex legal, ethical and constitutional issues arising from the need to fairly balance the rights of all parties to the adoption process.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 95 together.</P>
        <P>The HSE has made significant progress on reconfiguring acute hospital and related services in the Mid West region informed by the Teamwork/Horwath Report and the Health Information and Quality Authority Report on Ennis, which was published in April 2009.  These Reports highlighted the need for changes to be made in the organisation and provision of acute hospital services across the Mid West region as they found services there to be too fragmented, to carry increased risks for patients and staff and to be unsustainable in their present form.</P>
        <P>The reconfiguration of services in the Mid-West Region has involved the cessation of 24-hour Accident and Emergency services at Ennis and Nenagh and the transfer of all planned and emergency in-patient surgery from the two hospitals to Limerick Regional Hospital.  Ambulance and Paramedic services in Clare and Tipperary have been enhanced.  Ennis and Nenagh hospitals now provide an urgent care/minor injuries service for 12 hours a day as part of a regional Accident and Emergency structure.  These hospitals also now undertake an expanded range of day case surgery and diagnostic work.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s draft capital plan is currently under consideration and details of capital projects will be made available when the plan has been approved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 94 and 237 together.</P>
        <P>A total of 1083 Parliamentary Questions were taken by my Department during the period from 3rd March 2010 to 13th May 2010. Of these, 767 (71%) have not been answered due to industrial action by certain staff both within my Department and in the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Responding to the information needs of the Oireachtas is a priority for my Department and I very much regret that in recent months it has not been possible to provide a substantive response to many Parliamentary Questions due to industrial action. All Parliamentary Questions affected by the action have been answered by my Department to the effect that the industrial dispute has prevented the supply of substantive answers, and Deputies have been consistently advised to raise the question again in due course should the matter remain of ongoing concern. This approach was designed to prevent a backlog of questions building up, particularly as a significant proportion of the questions related to cases where the information being sought by the Deputy through the Parliamentary process might, in the circumstances, be obtained by alternative means.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children will handle in the region of 6,000 Parliamentary Questions this year, approximately half of which will be referred to the Health Service Executive, either for the provision of information to the Department or for direct reply to the Deputy. A considerable proportion of these will concern personal inquiries on behalf of individuals seeking services from the HSE.  In such cases, the information can also be obtained by addressing the inquiry directly to the relevant service area of the Executive, and where members of the public do so on their own behalf, their inquiries are not affected by the current dispute.</P>
        <P>I fully appreciate the frustration of Deputies who are currently unable to obtain information through the usual Parliamentary channels.  While alternative access is available for individual cases, Deputies may wish to resubmit, on resolution of the dispute, any questions in respect of wider service, operational and policy issues that have not been answered and are still a cause of concern. My Department and the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive will, when the current industrial action is resolved, continue to assist Deputies as before.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 77, 79, 88 and 278 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE), which has responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement, is anticipating that there may be some difficulties in the filling of Non-Consultant Hospital Doctor (NCHD) posts in July when doctors begin their new training rotation.  Initial reports from the HSE indicate reductions in applications for these posts, especially in emergency medicine, anaesthesia, general medicine and in smaller hospitals. A range of proposals to address the situation, if there is a significant number of unfilled posts, are currently being worked on by the HSE.</P>
        <P>A number of factors determine the extent to which the HSE can fill the full cohort of NCHD posts:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the legal requirement under the Medical Practitioners Act &mdash; reflected in the NCHD Contract 2010 &mdash; to employ NCHDs in line with their training or non-training status and related medical registration status;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reductions in the levels of overtime available arising from the implementation of the European Working Time Directive;</P><Col N="335"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />and the ability of the HSE and HSE-funded agencies to compete in the international recruitment market for NCHDs.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I have asked the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the number of unfilled Non-Consultant Hospital Doctor posts in hospitals.  The HSE and the Government are determined that patients will continue to have hospital services that are accessible and responsive to their medical needs.</P>
        <P>With regard to the impact of the European Working Time Directive on services, attainment of compliance is good for patient safety.  It is agreed that it serves no good purpose to have over-stretched, over-tired junior doctors treating patients. The use of excessive levels of overtime is not in patients&rsquo; best interests.</P>
        <P>In relation to attracting doctors from outside the EEA, concerns have been expressed that the current visa and work permit obligations for non-EEA doctors may be hindering recruitment.  Discussions are in train between my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and the HSE.  The objective is to provide a framework that facilitates the entry of non-EEA doctors while ensuring effective and appropriate visa and work permit arrangements are in place.  My Department has been advised that visas are now being issued for 12 months duration and they can be renewed annually at a local Garda Station.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 70 together.</P>
        <P>I have been assured that Beaumont Hospital will meet its service plan targets for 2010. These involve treating the same number of patients this year as last but with less reliance on in-patient stays. In turn this will involve reducing inappropriate hospital admissions, more same day of surgery admissions, more day care cases, earlier discharges and reductions in waiting times for elective surgery.</P>
        <P>The planned changes announced by Beaumont are designed to allow it deliver its service plan targets while remaining within budget. For example, the increase in day case activity and the reduction in beds occupied by long-stay patients means the hospital can treat the same number of patients as previously with less in-patient beds. Beaumont has also assured my Department that neurosurgery, transplantation and cancer services will not be affected by the changes.</P>
        <P>Treating people in more efficient and effective ways like this, with no reduction in access to appropriate services, is obviously the right thing to do given the very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer. However, it is also the right thing for patients &mdash; people want to access quality care as quickly as possible and be allowed go home as soon as possible. It is also the way health services around the world are moving.</P><Col N="336"/>
        <P>There are constant calls inside and outside this House for a more efficient public service, changes in work practices and greater productivity.  Despite this, we still hear opposition to such changes with the focus being put instead on issues like the number of in-patient beds rather than the number of patients being treated, and the achievement of best outcomes for patients.</P>
        <P>Reforming the way services are provided, reducing costs and maintaining a clear focus on patient safety will allow us to treat people in more effective ways and protect access to appropriate services. I want to make it clear to this House that the implementation by Beaumont Hospital, and other hospitals, of this type of patient-centred reform will have my full support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 92 together.</P>
        <P>The Government has decided to introduce a system of reference pricing combined with generic substitution under the GMS and community drugs schemes. This will promote price competition and deliver ongoing savings for both the State and for patients. Achieving greater value for money in this area of expenditure will ensure that patients can continue to access innovative and affordable medicines.</P>
        <P>A working group, made up of officials and healthcare professionals from my Department and the HSE, has set out a proposed model for the implementation of this initiative. I received the report of this working group last week and it shall be published on my Department&rsquo;s website shortly. I expect to see significant progress on the recommendations of the report in 2010, including the identification of legislative and administrative changes required to give effect to them, where appropriate, in 2011.</P><Col N="337"/>
        <P>There are some categories of medicines that are not suitable for substitution. In addition, there are also certain circumstances where an individual patient should receive a particular product. With a system of generic substitution, it is important that all decisions about the interchangeability of medicines are evidence-based and take into account best practice elsewhere.  A key recommendation of the report is that an expert group should provide guidance on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 91 together. </P>
        <P>The most recent information on bed closures in the acute hospital system refers to the week ended 17 January 2010.  At that time, 689 inpatient beds and 37 day beds were closed for reasons of cost-containment, infection control, refurbishment and seasonal closure of facilities.</P>
        <P>While public debate tends to focus on bed numbers, it is much more meaningful to measure the actual number of patients treated.  In 2009, the combined number of inpatient and day case discharges was 3% greater than the equivalent figure in 2008, despite the difficult situation in relation to resources.</P>
        <P>The preparation of the HSE&rsquo;s 2010 National Service Plan, which I approved on 5 February, maintains the focus on increased efficiency and targets broadly the same level of overall hospital activity as in 2009.  This involves a shift from in-patient to day cases, a reduction in emergency admissions and a further increase in day cases.</P>
        <P>While there is no proposal in the Service Plan to close a specific number of beds, the reduction in in-patient treatments will mean that less capacity will be required in this area during 2010.  The exact number of beds available at any one time will fluctuate depending on such factors as planned activity levels, maintenance and refurbishment requirements and staff leave arrangements. Beds may also be closed from time to time in order to control expenditure, given the need for every hospital to operate within its allotted budget for the year.</P>
        <P>Meeting the agreed efficiency targets will require increased access to the specialist skills and senior clinical decision-making available in Medical Assessment Units, to diagnostics and to other ambulatory care services. The HSE will also focus on minimising length of stay, with a particular focus on reducing the current variation across different hospitals for similar procedures.  It will also work to increase same day of surgery admission and to protect inpatient beds for elective surgery in order to reduce waiting times.</P><Col N="338"/>
        <P>By reforming the manner in which services are provided, I am confident that the HSE can deliver the volumes of service provided for in the plan, while at the same time continuing to improve service quality and patient outcomes.</P>

        <Quest> if the VHI fulfilled its legal obligation to achieve solvency by the end of March 2010; if the EU Competition Commissioner has contacted her concerning possible legal action and sanctions if the VHI does not meet the requirements of the Financial Regulator regarding appropriate levels of solvency; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from a derogation under the Non-Life Insurance Directives, VHI continues to be exempt from prudential solvency requirements.  The Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2008 provided for the VHI to acquire sufficient funding in terms of its capital reserves to enable it to make an application to the Financial Regulator for authorisation.  The date originally fixed by that Act was 31 December 2008, but this was subject to the right of the Minister to appoint a later date by Order, if satisfied that there is good and sufficient reason for so doing.  At the time the original date was fixed, the Supreme Court had not yet ruled in relation to the risk equalisation scheme, which it struck down in July 2008. Since then I have extended the date by which the VHI must accrue the necessary reserves on five occasions.  The date is now 1 January 2012.  However, it remains my firm conviction that VHI should be properly authorised and that the derogation should be lifted.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission has commenced proceedings against the State in the European Court of Justice regarding the VHI&rsquo;s derogation.  The State has forwarded a comprehensive written defence to the Court.  The matter of sanctions would only arise in the event of an adverse judgment if nothing was then done to ameliorate the situation and further proceedings were then brought to seek financial penalties against the State.</P>
        <P>The capital position and authorisation of the VHI are only two of many inter-related and complex issues that need to be resolved in order to achieve a stable community-rated private health insurance market.</P>
        <P>I have been examining the broad range of issues involved with my officials, expert advisers and the Health Insurance Authority.  The matter has also been considered by the Government on a number of occasions since the Supreme Court Judgement.  I will make a full statement at the appropriate time on the measures required to support the Government&rsquo;s key policy goal of a community-rated health insurance market.</P>

	<P>I am conscious that the cancellation of a hospital procedure can be inconvenient and stressful for both patients and their families.  Every effort is made to avoid cancellations where possible.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately cancellations are a feature of hospital systems, in Ireland and internationally because priority must be given to emergency cases and patients in urgent need. It is important <Col N="339"/>to point out that all cancelled procedures are rescheduled. While data is not comprehensive the level of cancellations in the Irish public system appears to be broadly in line with other hospital systems internationally.  In 2009, for example, it is estimated that cancellations accounted for about 1.4% of all in-patient and day case activity.</P>
        <P>It should be noted not all cancellations are as a result of hospital capacity or availability. Cancellations also occur for clinical reasons, where a patient may not be deemed fit for surgery on a given day by the clinician. For example, the pre-admission assessment might indicate postponing a procedure for clinical reasons such as weight, immune system or blood pressure.</P>
        <P>While it is unfortunate that any patient would have a procedure cancelled, patients waiting over three months can be referred to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). The HSE works with the NTPF to ensure that, where appropriate, patients can avail of treatment under this scheme.</P>
        <P>In 2010, the HSE is focusing on improving the efficiency of acute hospital services by shifting to day case care where appropriate and by seeking performance improvements such as surgery on the day of admission and reducing inappropriate lengths of stay.  There will be a particular focus on reducing the variance between different hospitals for similar procedures.  By reducing costs and reforming the way services are provided, I am confident the HSE will maintain access to services and continue to improve health outcomes for the population.</P>

	<P><i>&lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; </i>outlines a comprehensive model for mental health service provision for Ireland.  It describes a framework for building and fostering positive mental health across the entire community and for providing accessible, community-based, specialist services for people with mental illness.  <i>&rsquo;Reach Out&rsquo; provides</i> a policy framework for suicide prevention activities in Ireland.   The strategy calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behav<Col N="340"/>iour in order to foster cooperation between health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies. Implementation of these Strategies are a matter for the HSE.  </P>
        <P>Initiatives which have been progressed by the HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) include developing and implementing national training programmes; the development of a training strategy under the direction of a Training and Development Officer; progressing the availability of self-harm services through Hospital Emergency departments; implementing recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services; dedicated suicide resource officers; the provision of funding to the National Suicide Research Foundation (NSRF); supporting voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention and  developing mental health awareness campaigns.  The NOSP also published an information leaflet and wallet card targeted at the general public entitled <i>&lsquo;looking after your mental health during tough economic times&rsquo;</i>.  The resources outline information on the impact unemployment and financial difficulties have on mental health and wellbeing, how people can look after their mental health, signs of common mental health problems and available support services.   An information booklet called <i>&lsquo;Suicide Prevention in the Workplace&rsquo;</i>  which provides organisations and workplaces with practical guidance on how staff can respond to and support persons who are at risk of suicidal behaviour has also been made available.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 118 together.</P>
        <P>In the light of the health risks associated with some of the products being sold in head shops, the Government made an Order on 11 May declaring a number of substances, commonly referred to as so-called &ldquo;legal highs&rdquo;, to be controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, with immediate effect.</P>
        <P>The substances controlled include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />synthetic cannabinoids (contained in SPICE products),</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />benzylpiperazine (BZP) and piperazine derivatives,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />mephedrone, methylone, methedrone, butylone, flephedrone, MDPV,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Gamma butyrolactone and 1,4 Butanediol.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Under this new legislation, it is now an offence for a person to import, export, produce, supply or possess these legal high substances.</P>
        <P>There have been reports in the media that Head Shop owners may seek to circumvent the new controls by importing other substances that are currently not subject to the Misuse of <Col N="341"/>Drugs Act. I will not hesitate to seek Government approval to ban additional substances if any of them pose a risk to public health.</P>
        <P>I should also mention that my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, is currently bringing forward urgent legislation that would make it a criminal offence generally to supply unregulated psychoactive substances for use by humans.</P>

	<P>I and my officials held a number of meetings with senior health officials and with the Minister for Health during my recent visit to New Zealand. In the course of those meetings we discussed the role of the Accident Compensation Corporation and the general no fault compensation scheme that operates there.  </P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, an advisory group was established in 2001, to examine the equity, effectiveness and appropriateness of existing arrangements for compensating persons who suffer cerebral damage at, or close to the time of birth, and to make such recommendations as the Group sees fit.  The Group has yet to complete its work. I will await the Group&rsquo;s report before giving further consideration to a wider no fault compensation scheme for the health services.</P>
        <P>In this country, compensation in many cases involving cerebral damage is dealt with under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme of enterprise liability.  Cerebral Palsy is a complex condition which can be caused by, inter alia, prematurity, developmental brain malformation, neurological damage to the developing brain, hypoxia or medical error.</P>
        <P>I understand that the average time from the institution of proceedings to the ultimate resolution of a typical CP case is now approximately 4 years as a result of the introduction of Enterprise Liability.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 98 and 126 together.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decision to limit the funding available to the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) was made in view of the current position of the public finances and the 60% increase in expenditure in the DTSS over the past five years. The Health Service Executive (HSE) has introduced measures to contain DTSS expenditure at the 2008 level of approximately &euro;63 million.</P>
        <P>Under the new measures, some treatments which had previously been available in the Scheme, for example, dental cleaning and polishing have been suspended.  Other treatments, such as oral examinations and fillings, will continue to be provided but will be limited in number or frequency. More complex, non-routine treatments, such as protracted periodontal treatments, will be available only in the case of clinical emergencies. These measures were introduced following consultation with my Department. The HSE will monitor the ongoing effect of these changes from a clinical and budgetary perspective. The dental and oral health services <Col N="343"/>currently provided through the HSE Public Dental Service will not be affected by these changes to the DTSS.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Approximately 77 million laboratory tests are undertaken annually across 44 public hospitals.  At present the annual cost of this service is approximately &euro;470 million.  The workload comprises both urgent and non-urgent tests and a significant proportion of the activity originates in the primary care setting. As with all other parts of the health service, and indeed the public service generally, it is essential that laboratory services are delivered as safely and as cost effectively as possible.  </P>
        <P>An external review of laboratory services was conducted for the HSE by Teamwork Management Services in 2007. The HSE has stated that Teamwork, in undertaking the review, consulted with the Association of Clinical Biochemists in Ireland amongst other stakeholders. The review highlighted limitations in the organisation of laboratories which had an adverse effect on quality, turnaround time and cost. It found at that time that &ldquo;the whole system quality&rdquo; of laboratories was not of a sufficiently high standard. The review also found that the overall proportion of individual laboratory medicine disciplines that had achieved accreditation status was low, &ldquo;end-to-end&rdquo; information systems were unsatisfactory and logistic services were inadequate. It found as well that the general condition of the laboratory estate typically was of traditional design and was outmoded.</P>
        <P>In light of the review, the HSE announced plans in the early part of 2009 to modernise laboratory services and to achieve significant efficiencies in the configuration and operation of these services.  The HSE has already had significant engagement with stakeholders in progressing this initiative.  Groups such as the Faculty of Pathology, the Medical Laboratory Scientists&rsquo; Association and the Association of Clinical Biochemists in Ireland will continue to have a significant input into the process.</P>
        <P>As part of this initiative, the HSE has commenced discussions with the National Development Finance Agency about the capital financing of a small number of dedicated &ldquo;cold&rdquo; laboratories to process the large volumes of routine patient tests generated from the primary and community care sector which are currently undertaken in hospital laboratories.  The HSE is also having a business case/cost-benefit analysis undertaken to assess a number of options which have been put forward for the processing of cold laboratory work.  Any new laboratory service arrangements will need to satisfy a range of service and quality requirements, including supporting the provision of integrated care to patients.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to acknowledge that a number of improvements in laboratory services have taken place since the completion of the Teamwork review. The number of individual accredited laboratory disciplines has increased significantly. In addition, some reconfiguration of laboratory services has been achieved by transferring work undertaken in a number of small laboratories to larger laboratories. This has allowed for a higher level of throughput. The HSE has indicated that improved processes, introduced in the past year, have achieved non pay savings in 2009 of some &euro;5m.</P><Col N="345"/>
        <P>I am satisfied that the measures being taken by the HSE, with ongoing input from stakeholders, to modernise laboratory services are necessary and appropriate for the reasons which have been outlined.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 109 together.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputies that, due to industrial action affecting the Health Service Executive, it is not possible for the Executive to supply current information in relation to the number of adults and children residing in residential centres for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, &ldquo;National Quality Standards: Residential Settings for People with Disabilities&rdquo;, which relate to adult services have been published by HIQA. These standards will provide a national framework for quality, safe services for persons with disabilities in a residential setting.</P>
        <P>Given the current economic situation, to move to full statutory implementation of the standards, including regulation and inspection, presents significant challenges at this time.  However, notwithstanding the difficulties of immediate statutory implementation, my Department, the HSE and HIQA have agreed that progressive non-statutory implementation of the standards will now commence, and that they will become the benchmark against which the HSE assesses both its own directly operated facilities and other facilities that the HSE funds.</P>
        <P>A number of preliminary processes are already in place within the HSE to facilitate this work. For example, compliance with the HIQA standards is included in the Service Level Arrangements being implemented between the HSE and service providers.  As part of the ongoing review of Service Level Arrangements, service providers will now be required to demonstrate compliance with the standards through the provision of audit outcomes.  I am informed by the HSE that the majority of service providers have already commenced a review of their services within the context of the HIQA standards and many service providers have also achieved external accreditation over the past number of years.</P>
        <P>In addition, arising from the Ryan Commission report, the Minister for Health and Children will shortly be bringing detailed proposals to Government with regard to the protection of vulnerable adults with disabilities who are currently in institutional care.</P>
        <P>Children with disabilities in generic residential centres under the Child Care Act 1991 are covered by the standards and inspection regimes already applying to those centres.  There are a number of other centres providing residential or respite care to children with disabilities. Children who reside in these centres are not in the care of the State, although they are cared for by the State. The majority of these centres are run by voluntary organisations funded by the HSE and are not included in the inspection regime under the Child Care Act 1991. In relation to the children with disabilities in these other residential centres, the Ryan Commission <Col N="346"/>report recommends that &ldquo;all services for children should be subject to regular inspections in respect of all aspects of their care&rdquo;.  The implementation plan for the recommendations of the Ryan Commission report contains a commitment that the Health Act 2007 will be commenced to allow the independent registration and inspection of all residential centres and respite services for children with a disability by December 2010.</P>
        <P>In addition, I am assured by the HSE that it has a robust system in place to deal with any complaints made in relation to the treatment of persons with disabilities in residential care. This includes ensuring that all HSE funded service providers of residential care have appropriate complaints procedures that are in line with HSE policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I approved the HSE National Service Plan 2010 on 5th February. In approving the Plan, I highlighted to the Executive the need to deliver, at a minimum, the levels of service set out in the Plan as well as operating within the limits of its Voted allocation of &euro;14.069bn. The Government made a series of decisions that will reduce HSE costs by some &euro;1bn, made up of savings of &euro;630m and non-pay savings of &euro;394m. The latter includes a target of &euro;106m in non-pay economies to be saved by the HSE in 2010, including substantial procurement savings. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that there has been considerable difficulties in monitoring the implementation of the Plan due to an industrial relations dispute which has resulted in no performance management information being made available to the management of the HSE. Arising from a Labour Court decision last month it has now been agreed that financial information will be exempted from the ban on information. However there continues to be difficulties in respect of other management information. I have fully supported the HSE in its efforts to resolve this issue.</P>
        <P>In the context of uncertainty regarding the financial position of the HSE the Executive indicated publicly that it was developing proposals to initiate cost reduction measures which might have the effect of reducing some of the service levels set out in the National Service <Col N="347"/>Plan, at least on a temporary basis. Any reduction in planned services would require an amendment to the approved Service Plan by the HSE Board and approved by me. No such amendment has been sought and in any event I believe that on the information currently available it would not be acceptable for patients/users to suffer service reductions in the current circumstances. I welcome the subsequent acceptance of the Labour Court recommendations by the HSE and IMPACT. This should assist in ensuring delivery of services in line with the original Service Plan and within the Executive&rsquo;s voted allocation.</P>
        <P>My Department is continuing to liaise closely with the HSE on this matter.</P>

	<P>At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances. Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused. </P>
        <P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependents who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of general practitioner services.  For medical card and GP visit card applications, the HSE considers an applicant&rsquo;s income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income. Allowances are also made for expenses on childcare, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group of patients with particular medical conditions as a whole.</P>

	<P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the recommendations on possible incentives for general practitioners and other health professionals in the development of Primary Care Centres, made by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in its Report on <i>Primary Medical Care in the Community </i>published in February 2010<i>.</i></P>
        <P>At present the HSE is offering to take 25 year leases at agreed rates in Primary Care Centres which have GP involvement.  GPs and health professionals entering such centres are doing so at very attractive rates which developers can only offer because of the security and value of <Col N="348"/>the HSE lease.  Given the current economic climate, the Government is unlikely to be in a position to make any further incentives available.</P>

	<P>The public pandemic vaccination campaign came to an end on 31st of March, 2010.  Following a full assessment of the current situation, the risks of a second wave, the availability of vaccine and other factors, the National Public Health Emergency Team decided, following advice received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, that those in the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; group will continue to be vaccinated.  This means that up to September 2010 the vaccine will continue to be available free of charge through GPs and Maternity Units to the following groups of people:</P>
        <P>Pregnant women &mdash; from 14 weeks pregnant to 6 weeks after giving birth All those newly diagnosed in the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; group i.e.  Anyone aged over 6 months and under 65 years who has:</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>&lsquo;<i>A Vision for Change</i>&rsquo; the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy recommended that a plan to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals should be drawn up and implemented, and that the resources released by these closures should be re-invested in the mental health service.  The Government has accepted this recommendation and accordingly the proceeds of the sale of psychiatric lands will be ringfenced to fund new mental health capital developments.  In this regard, &euro;25m of the proceeds of the sales of psychiatric lands was returned to the HSE through the Supplementary Estimate for 2009 and this funded developments, including the new child and adolescent units in Cork and Galway, a Community Nursing Unit in Ballinasloe and a day centre in Clonmel.   Budget 2010 provided for a multi-annual programme of capital investment which will provide high priority mental health projects across the spectrum of mental health facilities which will be funded from future disposals.  In 2010, the HSE may dispose of surplus assets and reinvest an initial sum of &euro;50m in the mental <Col N="350"/>health capital programme.  Provision for continued funding of the programme will be made in the 2011 Estimates and subsequent years, in the light of the previous year&rsquo;s programme of asset sales.  </P>
        <P>With regard to revenue funding, the position is that there are substantial resources already invested in mental health.  Implementation of a <i>&lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;</i> requires that these existing resources be remodelled and reallocated.  Thus, as the old institutions close, resources will be transferred to the community to facilitate the development of a dynamic and person centred community based mental health service.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE), with my full support, has decided to centralise the processing of all medical cards and GP visit card applications and renewals to its Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.  The process commenced in January 2009 when the PCRS took over the processing of all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices in Dublin. </P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, the initiative to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals will ensure:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Improved turnaround times for the processing of applications: under the new arrangements the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 working days or less, with provision for emergency applications to be dealt with immediately;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Consistent and equitable application of eligibility and service provision;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Clearer governance and accountability, as well as improved management information.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In a communication to all Oireachtas members on 19th January 2010, I provided a list with the names and telephone numbers of the local health office managers and, in each case, a contact name or names and telephone numbers and e-mail addresses for enquiries from Oireachtas Members about medical card and GP visit card applications being dealt with by local health offices.  The list also gave the contact details of a dedicated contact person in the PCRS for enquiries from Oireachtas Members about medical card and GP visit card applications and reviews being dealt with by the PCRS.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that ongoing industrial action by certain HSE staff is affecting some of the Executive&rsquo;s work.  Neither I nor officials in my Department have instructed HSE officials not to respond to queries from Oireachtas Members or other public representatives.</P>
        <P>In relation to the other issues raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I wish to advise that due to industrial action affecting the Health Service Executive it is not possible for the Executive to supply the information requested.  If these matters remain of continuing concern to you, however, I would invite you to raise them with me again in due course.</P>

	<P>I take it that the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the review of my Department that was carried out last year under the Organisational Review Programme (ORP). Following receipt of the report of the review in February last, the Department set about preparing an Action Plan setting out its response to the ORP conclusions. The report and action plan will be published in due course along with similar reports and action plans for other Government Offices, following submission to the Government. </P>
        <P>The ORP is a public service modernisation initiative under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach. It involves assessing the capacity of individual Government Departments and major Offices to meet their challenges over the coming years.  My Department has already made it clear that it welcomes this report and is satisfied that it provides a timely and helpful review.  The report acknowledges the Department&rsquo;s strengths and achievements including, in particular, the ability and commitment of its staff in dealing with a difficult agenda.</P>
        <P>It also identifies areas which require improvement, which include the Department&rsquo;s human resource capacities.  The drafting of the Action Plan is now at an advanced stage and I would anticipate that it will be sent forward to the Department of the Taoiseach shortly for submission to Government.</P>
        <P>The process of drafting the plan has involved extensive internal consultation and it will set out an agreed set of actions designed to address the issues raised in the report and provide a roadmap for the future development of the Department to meet the challenges over the coming years.</P><Col N="354"/>
        <P>I am confident that the Action Plan will be an effective response to the report  and my Department will use it to build on its undoubted strengths and to further improve its performance in these changing and challenging times.</P>

	<P>There is no statutory requirement for the Health Service Executive to meet with members of the Oireachtas in order to provide briefing on local issues. However, both my Department and the Executive regard the provision of information to Oireachtas members as a priority and there are a number of channels by which briefing material and other information is provided on a regular and ongoing basis. </P>
        <P>The Executive has arranged local area briefings for Oireachtas members on an ad hoc basis and it had been intended to hold such briefings earlier this year. However this had to be postponed due to the current industrial action by members of IMPACT. The Executive fully intends to resume this practice once the industrial action has been resolved. It should be noted that outside of such briefings it is open to Oireachtas members to contact their local Health Office Manager or Hospital Manager should they wish to discuss a particular issue. Contact details for local managers have been provided to Oireachtas members and the Executive&rsquo;s Parliamentary Affairs Division can also provide contact assistance if required.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004 (Dealings with members of either House of the Oireachtas) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 798 of 2005) sets out arrangements for enabling members of the Oireachtas to contact the Executive and specifies a wide range of documentation and information which the Executive must make available to Oireachtas members. This includes:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Executive&rsquo;s Corporate Plan as approved by the Minister for Health and Children under Section 29 of the Health Act 2004;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />any Service Plan as approved by the Minister pursuant to Section 31 of the Act;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Annual Report as prepared by the Executive and submitted to the Minister pursuant to Section 37 of the Act;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />any reports or statistical data made available to the public by the Executive.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Deputy will be aware that under Section 42 of the Health Act 2004, Regional Health Forums have been established in each of the Executive&rsquo;s administrative areas, the purpose of which is to enable city and county councillors to make representations to the Executive, as appropriate, on the range and operation of health and personal social services provided within its functional area. S.I. 798 of 2005 also provides that any record of proceedings of a Regional Health Forum, or of a committee established by a Regional Health Forum, must be made available to Oireachtas members.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that a vast amount of information on both local area issues and national policy issues is regularly provided to Oireachtas members by way of responses to Parliamentary Questions, Adjournment Debates and other Parliamentary business in the House. I regret that in recent months this channel of information has been curtailed due to <Col N="355"/>industrial action. However, members will again be at liberty to pursue this option once the current industrial action has been fully resolved.</P>

	<P>Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 commenced for children aged under 5 years with effect from 1st June 2007.  Significant work was undertaken by my Department and the HSE in preparation for the commencement of the Disability Act in respect of children under the age of 5 including: the development of standards for the assessment of need process; the publication of Regulations and the Commencement Order; the appointment of Assessment Officers responsible for the coordination of the Assessment of Need; and the appointment of Liaison Officers  responsible for the provision of Service Statements.</P>
        <P>Meeting the statutory deadlines on providing assessments and service statements has proved challenging to the HSE.

These are reported on a quarterly basis in the HSE&rsquo;s performance monitoring reports.</P>

        <Quest> the reason Ireland continues to be blacklisted by the Russian authorities in relation to adoptions from the Russian Federation arising from the failure of the authorities here to forward post placement reports of Russian children already adopted in this country; the number of post placement reports that are currently outstanding; the steps that are being taken to address the situation in order that Irish adoptive parents can again complete the adoption process. </Quest>

	<P>Regions from within more than a dozen countries, including Ireland, the United States, the United Kingdom and France were recently &ldquo;blacklisted&rdquo; by the Russian Ministry of Education, thus suspending referrals for adoption.  The issue as it pertains to Ireland relates to the provision of Post Placement Reports by adoptive parents. When adopting from Russia, adoptive parents agree to complete a series of post placement reports on the child. These reports are lodged by the adoptive parents with the Russian authorities. This is an administrative arrangement as part of the Russian adoption process and is not a legal requirement. While neither the Adoption Board nor the HSE have a statutory function in relation to the provision of the reports, they facilitate the preparation of same. </P><Col N="356"/>
        <P>The issue arose previously, in 2009, and was resolved to the satisfaction of the Russian authorities. I was surprised to learn of this latest problem as there had been recent positive feedback from the Russian authorities and there was no indication that there was to be a suspension of adoptions for Irish applicants.</P>
        <P>Once I became aware of the problem, contact was immediately made with the Russian Embassy in Dublin to confirm the suspension of adoption activity and to seek the Embassy&rsquo;s assistance in identifying all outstanding reports. A list of cases where reports were considered to be outstanding was supplied by the Russian Embassy and has since been examined in detail by the HSE and the Adoption Board. It was established, and accepted by the Russian Embassy, that more than half of the reports listed by the Russian authorities as outstanding had, in fact, been previously completed by the adoptive parents and forwarded to the Russian authorities. The majority of the remaining reports had previously been completed by the HSE and are currently with the adoptive parents. In a small number of cases, adoptive parents have not engaged with the HSE, thus preventing the completion of reports. I met with diplomats from the Russian Embassy recently in order to review the position and with a view to re-opening the adoption process for Irish applicants. I am awaiting a response from the Russian Embassy on the matter.</P>
        <P>I am very aware of the anxiety experienced by those who are waiting to adopt from Russia as a result of this issue. Parents who have already adopted from Russia are being encouraged by the health authorities to provide any outstanding information to the Russian Government in a timely fashion .</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I have read and noted the contents of the newspaper report referred to by the Deputy. </P>
        <P>The provision of foster care is central to child welfare and protection.  In the course of an inspection last year, HIQA identified  serious issues in the HSE Local Health Offices of Dublin North West and Dublin North Central.  Key concerns included gaps in the assessment of foster carers, a lack of contact between social workers and foster care children &amp; their families, and weaknesses in the management of records.  HIQA brought their concerns to the attention of the HSE.  The HSE developed an action plan to address any weaknesses identified and is in ongoing contact with HIQA in terms of addressing any deficits identified.</P>
        <P>I met with the HSE to discuss the issues identified by HIQA arising from the inspections.   I emphasised to the HSE the importance of ensuring that comprehensive plans are in place as a priority to address any weaknesses identified in the provision of foster care services, and the need to ensure that these plans are fully delivered upon in the shortest possible timeframe.  It is particularly important that the HSE take all necessary steps to deliver the approved increase <Col N="357"/>of 200 social workers in the current year in order to ensure, at a minimum, that every child in care has access to an allocated social worker.</P>
        <P>It is a positive development that inconsistencies in practice and identified problems are now being identified through the work of the HSE&rsquo;s own internal audit processes and through the inspection process of HIQA.  The challenge facing the HSE is the need to ensure that all necessary measures are taken as a priority to address any weaknesses identified.</P>
        <P>Any allegation of abuse of a child in the care of the State should be noted to the statutory authorities in accordance with Children First.  In addition Section 10 of the National Standards for Foster Care sets out good practice in relation to dealing with issues of alleged abuse of children in foster care.</P>

        <P>Since its establishment in 2000, the Council has worked in particular to ensure that pre-hospital personnel in the statutory, private and voluntary sectors are appropriately trained for the roles which they carry out.

	<P>Regions from within more than a dozen countries, including Ireland, the United States, the United Kingdom and France were recently &ldquo;blacklisted&rdquo; by the Russian Ministry of Education, thus suspending referrals for adoption.  The issue as it pertains to Ireland relates to the provision of Post Placement Reports by adoptive parents. When adopting from Russia, adoptive parents agree to complete a series of post placement reports on the child. These reports are lodged by the adoptive parents with the Russian authorities. This is an administrative arrangement as part of the Russian adoption process and is not a legal requirement. While neither the Adoption Board nor the HSE have a statutory function in relation to the provision of the reports, they facilitate the preparation of same. </P>
        <P>The issue arose previously, in 2009, and was resolved to the satisfaction of the Russian authorities. I was surprised to learn of this latest problem as there had been recent positive feedback from the Russian authorities and there was no indication that there was to be a suspension of adoptions for Irish applicants.</P>
        <P>Once I became aware of the problem, contact was immediately made with the Russian Embassy in Dublin to confirm the suspension of adoption activity and to seek the Embassy&rsquo;s assistance in identifying all outstanding reports. A list of cases where reports were considered to be outstanding was supplied by the Russian Embassy and has since been examined in detail by the HSE and the Adoption Board. It was established, and accepted by the Russian Embassy, that more than half of the reports listed by the Russian authorities as outstanding had, in fact, been previously completed by the adoptive parents and forwarded to the Russian authorities. The majority of the remaining reports had previously been completed by the HSE and are currently with the adoptive parents. In a small number of cases, adoptive parents have not engaged with the HSE, thus preventing the completion of reports. I met with diplomats from the Russian Embassy recently in order to review the position and with a view to re-opening the adoption process for Irish applicants. I am awaiting a response from the Russian Embassy on the matter.</P>
        <P>I am very aware of the anxiety experienced by those who are waiting to adopt from Russia as a result of this issue. Parents who have already adopted from Russia are being encouraged by the health authorities to provide any outstanding information to the Russian Government in a timely fashion .</P>

	<P>The <i>Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy</i>  document, published in December 2008, contained a commitment to publish a whole-of-Government response to recommendations contained in Competition Authority reports within nine months of their publication. The October 2009 review of the Programme for Government, <i>Renewed Programme for Government</i>, further strengthened this pledge.</P>
        <P>The recommendations made by the Competition Authority result from studies it carries out on various sectors or professions at regular intervals and usually contain a suite of recommendations, aimed at improving competition in the relevant area and are addressed to the responsible Government Department or body.</P>
        <P>Following the commitment given by the Government in December 2008, my Department drew up an initial prioritised list of 21 recommendations, based on their impact on competitiveness. These 21 recommendations related, directly or indirectly, to five Government Departments.</P>
        <P>The Government has reviewed the progress made by these Government Departments in responding to the 21 recommendations and a Government Statement to this effect issued in April 2010.  In the statement the Government also noted that 40% of the total number of recommendations made by the Competition Authority between 2000 and 2009 had been implemented, with a further 9% being progressed.  Since the review by Government earlier this year the Competition Authority has confirmed the following as the current position. Out of a total of 163 recommendations, 69 (42%) have been implemented with a further 13 (8%) recommendations currently being progressed.</P>
        <P>The remaining number of recommendations (81 in total; 50%) can be classed as either not implemented; currently being considered by the relevant department or body; no longer relevant; not requiring action; or status unclear.  An exercise is currently underway to clarify the precise status of all of these &lsquo;outstanding&rsquo; recommendations in order to facilitate decisions on whether to reject or pursue each remaining recommendation.  In line with a recent Government Decision, I intend to bring to Government twice-yearly updates on the implementation of these and any further recommendations made by the Competition Authority.</P>
        <P>My Department has prepared a detailed list of the 163 recommendations made to date by the Competition Authority. The list also indicates the current status of each recommendation. <Col N="362"/>I have arranged for this material to be sent to the Deputy directly.  The Deputy may also wish to visit the website of the Authority (www.tca.ie) on which can be found each of the market studies as well as the rationale for each recommendation.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide an update of the Irish legislative position regarding the implementation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005/29/EC which protects business to consumer relations and also the Misleading Advertising Directive 2006/114/EC which covers business to business transactions (details supplied). </Quest>

	<P>Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices has been given effect in Ireland by the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  The scope of the Directive, and of the provisions of the Act that give effect to it, is confined to commercial practices by a trader that are directly connected with the promotion, sale or supply of a product to consumers.  Section 8(6) of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 provides, however, that, while nothing in the Act imposes a duty on the National Consumer Agency to consider whether to investigate a matter referred to it by a trader, the Agency may consider whether to do so, and may accordingly proceed to investigate the matter, where it is satisfied that the matter may affect the interests and welfare of consumers.</P>
        <P>Directive 2006/114/EC on misleading and comparative advertising seeks to protect traders against misleading advertising and the unfair consequences thereof and to lay down the conditions under which comparative advertising is permitted.  It has been given effect in Ireland by the European Communities (Misleading and Comparative Marketing Communications) Regulations 2007 (S.I No. 774/2007).  Article 5 of the Regulations provides that a trader or other person may apply to the Circuit Court or the High Court for an order prohibiting a trader from engaging, or continuing to engage, in a misleading marketing communication or a prohibited comparative marketing communication, and sets out the rules governing such applications and orders.</P>
        <P>I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention also to the provisions of section 48 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 on directory entries.  This provides, among other things, that an order for an entry in a directory must be made by means of an order form or other stationery belonging to the person to whose business the directory entry is to relate, and that the note of a person&rsquo;s agreement to a charge for a directory entry must state the charge and various details relating to the directory.  A person is not liable for payment, or is entitled to recover any payment made by him, for a directory entry not made in compliance with the section.  It is also an offence for a person to demand payment, or assert a right to payment, for a charge for a directory entry without knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the entry was ordered in accordance with the section or that a proper note of agreement has been signed.</P>
        <P>It is not possible from the initial details supplied by the Deputy to establish if the practices by the business directory companies referred to there would come within the scope of Directive 2006/114/EC and the Regulations that give effect to it, or of section 48 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980.  If the Deputy is in a position to furnish additional information, I would be happy to have my Department consider the matter further.</P>

	<P>My Department condemns any practices by employers that may result in non-compliance with employment rights entitlements or any other mistreatment of employees including those on employment permits.  Ireland&rsquo;s Employment Rights Legislation establishes the statutory rights applicable to all people working in Ireland whether they are Irish citizens or otherwise.  I would urge all whose employment rights are being breached by an employer or those who know of such exploitation, to contact the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).</P>
        <P>The Employment Permits Act 2006 sets out in legislation the rules governing employment permits.  One of the main focuses of this Act was in increasing the rights and protections afforded to migrant workers and the means to ensure redress in the event of exploitative practices. The Act&rsquo;s provisions gave immigrants greater freedom, autonomy and control over their own employment choices by enabling workers for the first time to apply and re-apply for their own permit and allowing workers to change their employer after a period of a year and move to another employment in order to take advantage of better conditions or career options.  Last year, my Department issued almost 1,500 employment permits in respect of employees changing to new employers.</P>
        <P>A properly controlled employment permit system requires that permits be issued to a specific employee for a specific job with a specific employer.  To do otherwise would not only risk abuse of the employment permit system but would make it much more difficult to ensure that employers observed the employment rights of employees.  The Employment Permits Act 2006 allows for regular review of Ireland&rsquo;s economic migration policies and my Department keeps these policies under review, in line with the emerging needs of the labour market, on an on-going basis.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Enterprise Stabilisation Fund (ESF) was established by Government in 2009 as a 2-year scheme to support viable but vulnerable exporting companies experiencing difficulties because of the current economic climate.  Over the lifetime of the scheme to date, 4 Cavan companies have been approved <Col N="365"/>for support amounting to &euro;1,450,000 with the result that 356 jobs have been sustained in that County.  There have been no approvals for companies in Monaghan to date.</P>
        <P>At 30 April 2010, a total of 227 applications had been reviewed and 197 projects from 193 companies had been approved &euro;72m under the ESF, of which &euro;64m has been paid out to date.  The total number of jobs sustained as a result of this funding in 2009 was in the region of 7,500.</P>
        <P>The economic environment in which we are operating is evolving daily and the supports which government make available for company supports must change to reflect current priorities.  It is in this context that the overall funding allocated to Enterprise Ireland for company supports in 2010 amounts to &euro;278m, which represents an overall 26% increase on the outturn for 2009.</P>
        <P>While a smaller portion of this funding is being allocated to the ESF, the overall increase is a reflection of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting enterprise and the re-prioritisation of funding across the range of Enterprise Ireland programmes is taking account of the recovery phase which the Irish economy is now entering.</P>
        <P>To put this re-prioritisation of funding in context, all companies applying under the ESF are assessed to ascertain whether the Fund is a suitable support for them, in the event that it is not, then the company is re-directed to the most appropriate funding mechanism from EI&rsquo;s other suite of funding supports.</P>
        <P>The companies that Enterprise Ireland is now assisting includes those that are still vulnerable but just as importantly, those that have shown their potential for high growth and increased export sales.  This balance between supporting those companies which are still vulnerable and those, which are ready to grow, is the key to stabilising the position of some companies while facilitating others taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the recovery in global markets.</P>
        <P>Allocations to particular schemes are kept under constant review and adjusted to meet our economic needs at any given point in time.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department received a lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 28 May 2009.</P>
        <P>In instances such as this, where the employer does not formally wind the company up but goes into informal insolvency and is unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Department seeks from the employer evidence of inability to pay the entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company&rsquo;s Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% <Col N="366"/>liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.  If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.</P>
        <P>In the present instance, the necessary documentation has not been provided as yet. If it were, it should be possible to authorise the claim for payment shortly.   If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee&rsquo;s right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>At present the Industrial Development agencies under the aegis of my Department use a range of schemes to attract manufacturing or internationally-traded services operations to all parts of the country. The schemes available to all such companies in Dublin docklands are the same, and at the same aid rates, as those available elsewhere in Dublin. </P>
        <P>For the country as a whole, schemes fall into a number of categories. Regional aid is paid, in areas where it is allowed under EU State aid rules, in the form of capital or employment grants or in the form of preference shares, and the amount payable is linked to the level of investment or to the numbers to be employed in the operation. However, since 1 January, 2007, regional aid is no longer payable in Dublin, and therefore not in Dublin docklands. Other categories of aid are payable on a uniform basis across the country. These include grants to support Research Development and Innovation, Training grants, and SME supports such as towards the carrying out of market research or towards participation in trade fairs.</P>
        <P>Therefore, the category of schemes no longer available in Dublin docklands, or elsewhere in Dublin, is regional aid. The rate for regional aid in Dublin fell to 17.5% in 2000 and to 0% from 1 January, 2007.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The IDA Mid West region consists of Counties Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s regional strategy reflects the National Spatial Strategy, with an emphasis on the Limerick/Shannon Gateway and the hub town of Ennis. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for the Mid West Region is: to transition to a knowledge economy by winning new FDI in innovation driven, high value, high skills sectors; to work with the existing company base to expand their presence by increasing the number and scale of functions being carried out and by adding further strategic functions; to promote balanced regional development; to influence the provision of modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure; to work with local authorities and other partners to influence the creation of the right infrastructural environment to help win new FDI throughout the region; and to work closely with educational institutions in the region to develop the skill sets necessary to attract high value-added employment.</P>
        <P>The Agency cooperates with the existing base of employers to encourage additional investment, particularly in activities such as R&amp;D, customer support and back office functions. Over the past 2 years there have been 9 project announcements for the Mid-West Region of which 6 were for Limerick with a job potential of 1,173.  It should be noted however that jobs announced are typically created over a period of up to three to five years.  IDA works closely with Shannon Development in the provision of suitable property solutions for potential investors to the region, including Co Limerick.</P>

	<P>The role of the Waterford City Enterprise Board (CEB) is to provide support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level throughout Waterford City.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 to 160, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The provision of grant assistance to individual companies is a matter for the development agency or body concerned, and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that data in relation to funding is collated on a County only basis, so it is not possible to provide specific data in relation to Waterford City.</P>
        <P>The Propel Programme is a nationwide business development programme aimed at supporting the setting up of start up companies in the information technology and life science sectors that have significant export potential.  The initiative, the latest stage of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Propel Ideas into Business&rsquo; Programme&rsquo;, is geared towards providing a select number of entrepreneurs and early stage businesses with the skills and training required to take the next step in expanding their service offerings.  I understand from Enterprise Ireland that two applications have been received from companies in Waterford under this Programme and are currently at the evaluation stage.</P>
        <P>The Growth Fund, launched in 2008, is designed to assist SME clients of Enterprise Ireland to achieve greater competitiveness by improving their export potential.  This will be achieved by increasing both their gross output and gross productivity, while also providing new employment or maintaining existing employment levels. In 2009 and 2010, 3 companies from across Waterford, were approved funding totalling &euro;578,341 from the Growth Fund. Typically, this funding is paid out over a two-year period.</P>
        <P>Funding for company expansion is designed to assist companies achieve their growth plans. This includes support in the areas of capital equipment, training/management development, <Col N="371"/>job creation, recruitment of key managers and R&amp;D, with the focus on increasing exports.  In 2009 and 2010, 16 companies were approved a total of &euro;2,540,608 in Waterford with funding typically made available over a two to three year period.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland funding for investigating new ideas and markets is an essential aspect of business development. &ldquo;Funding for Exploring New Opportunities&rdquo; includes a range of different types of feasibility supports, assistance towards hiring a business mentor, attendance at trade fairs, and a range of consultancy supports.  In 2009 and 2010, under this initiative, 30 companies from Waterford were approved funding totalling &euro;523,416.</P>
        <P>In addition, Enterprise Ireland provides critical in-company R&amp;D funding designed to provide support for research, development and technological innovation relevant at all stages of company development, and which will enable companies to progress from undertaking an initial research project to high-level innovation and R&amp;D activity.  In 2009/10 there was one R&amp;D project approved for &euro;90,607 in Waterford. Innovation Vouchers give small companies access to the vast knowledge available in Irish Institutes of Technology, Universities and other public research bodies. The average Irish company can use these vouchers, worth &euro;5,000, to bring in knowledge that is new to the company.  In 2009, 10 Waterford City traders pooled their vouchers for a total of &euro;50,000 to develop a marketing strategy for local businesses.</P>
        <P>All EI&rsquo;s supports to companies work in a complementary manner, so it is not possible to say the number of jobs created individually by these various forms of funding. Enterprise Ireland is the lead government agency responsible for the development of Irish enterprise.  Its mission is to accelerate the development of world-class Irish companies to achieve strong positions in world markets.  Enterprise Ireland delivers a wide range of supports to Irish companies, targeted at the specific requirements of clients throughout all regions to ensure that they develop to their full potential in terms of employment, innovation and exports, which in turn, stimulates further job creation. Across the full range of supports, EI client companies had 3,640 full time employees in Waterford during 2009.</P>
        <P>Employment data in respect of companies supported by the Enterprise Agencies is collated by Forf&aacute;s on an annual basis and accordingly no data is available for 2010. This data is compiled on a county basis only so it is not possible to provide specific data for Waterford City. In 2009, 332 new full-time jobs were created in enterprise agency assisted firms (IDA Ireland 71 and Enterprise Ireland 322) in Waterford. At the end of 2009, the numbers in permanent employment in Enterprise Agency Assisted firms in Waterford stood at 9,247.</P>
        <P>The figures relating to net jobs existing in CEB-supported micro-enterprises are gathered in a CEB Job Survey each year. The net number of jobs existing in CEB-supported companies in Waterford (excluding jobs existing prior to CEB-support) as per the Survey for 2009 was 662. As figures are compiled on an annual basis, figures in respect of 2010 will not be available until early in 2011.</P>

	<P>I understand that the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to both persons in receipt of a State pension such as a Widow&rsquo;s <Col N="373"/>or Widower&rsquo;s Pension as well as to persons in receipt of a pension arising from public sector employment. Either way, the information requested by the Deputy is not held by my Department. </P>
        <P>The Deputy should be aware that Public Service pension entitlements may be carried from one Public Service employment to the next provided the employer is a member of the Public Service Transfer Network. Pensions are generally not payable until retirement age. Where they are being paid prior to retirement age, they will likely be subject to an actuarial reduction except in the case of the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement which was available to Civil and Public Servants in 2009.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> his plans to introduce new regulatory rules for the banking sector concerning risk management, compliance, liquidity management and general control processes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Most aspects of banking regulation are governed by the relevant EU directives, in particular the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), which implements the Basel II capital adequacy framework in the European Union.  A wide-ranging programme of reform has been mandated at international level by the G20, arising from analysis which highlighted areas where the existing Basel II framework was insufficiently prescriptive, including liquidity requirements; capital quality and capital buffers; large exposures; securitisation; supervisory coordination; and leverage ratios.  These reforms are being addressed in the EU through a series of amendments to the CRD, which will have to be transposed into national legislation. </P>
        <P>At a pan-European level, we are also seeing a change in the regulatory architecture through the implementation of the De Larosiere report which seeks to address structural &ldquo;systemic and inter-connected vulnerabilities&rdquo; highlighted in recent years.  Under proposals which are currently being finalised, a new EU function called the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) will be established under the ECB.  The ESRB&rsquo;s role will be to gather information on all macro-prudential risks in the EU.  At a micro level, a new European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) will also be established.  The current Level 3 Committees &mdash; CEBS (banking), CEIOPS (insurance), CESR (securities) &mdash; will be transformed into three new European Supervisory Authorities which will have a considerably expanded role compared to their current powers including issuing binding technical standards and having a strong coordinating role in crisis situations. There will be binding cooperation with the ESRB to provide adequate prudential supervision.  Ireland will be playing an active role at both a macro and micro level within this new framework.</P>
        <P>At national level, the Government is in the process of putting in place a domestic regulatory framework for financial services, including the banking sector, that: meets the Government&rsquo;s objective of maintaining the stability of the financial system; provides for the effective and efficient supervision of financial institutions and markets; and safeguards the interests of consumers and investors.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank Reform Bill 2010, which has just completed second stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, is the first of a three-stage legislative process to create a new fully-integrated structure for financial regulation.  It provides a statutory basis for a new structure which will replace the existing Central Bank and Financial Services Regulatory Authority.</P><Col N="374"/>
        <P>A second bill, to be brought before the House in the autumn, will enhance the powers and functions of the restructured Central Bank in relation to the: prudential supervision of individual financial institutions; conduct of business, including the protection of consumer interest; and overall stability of the financial system.</P>
        <P>Having regard to international developments, particularly at EU level, the second bill will provide an opportunity to consider what further provision might be made at that time with respect to financial institutions in national legislation in the areas mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>
        <P>A third bill will consolidate the statutory arrangements for the Central Bank and financial regulation in the State.</P>
        <P>I also understand that the Financial Regulator is developing an assertive risk-based system of regulation underpinned by the credible threat of enforcement.  This involves calibrating the intensity of its regulatory standards and day-to-day supervisory approach to the risk profile of the firms and sectors that are supervised.  In doing this, the Regulator will focus on risk mitigation, assessing business risk, and developing and using the risk model to assess firms systematically and to set the supervisory agenda.</P>
        <P>Where matters are not prescribed by EU legislation, the Financial Regulator will propose national standards.  The Financial Regulator has already published a package of proposals covering corporate governance standards and a consultation paper on Lending to Related Parties.  The proposals in both documents are expected to be implemented in autumn 2010.  The Financial Regulator also intends to issue further requirements, including tougher fitness and probity requirements and guidelines on remuneration and risk taking.  Many of these initiatives will extend beyond the banking sector to other categories of financial services firms but will be developed in a proportionate manner, in line with the Regulator&rsquo;s risk-based approach.</P>

	<P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) was established on 2 April 2001 with the objective of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 until at least 2055.</P>
        <P>No withdrawals have been made from the Fund. The Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009 amended the original legislation so as to allow the Minister for Finance to direct the NPRF Commission &mdash; who control and manage the Fund &mdash; to invest in a listed credit institution and to make payments into the Fund for the purposes of such an investment, such additional contributions to be offset against the contribution liability in future years. These amendments reflected the Government decision, announced on 11 February 2009, that the recapitalisation of Allied Irish Bank (AIB) and Bank of Ireland (BoI) through the purchase of preference shares by the NPRF would be funded by &euro;4 billion of the Fund&rsquo;s own resources and &euro;3 billion from the Exchequer through the frontloading of the 2009 and 2010 Exchequer contributions to the Fund.</P>
        <P>In March and May 2009, under the terms of this Act, the NPRF Commission invested, at my direction, a total of &euro;7 billion in preference shares issued by BoI and AIB (&euro;3.5 billion in each institution). I expect that this participation by the NPRF in the recapitalisation of AIB and BoI will yield a satisfactory return for the Fund over time and will assist the Fund in its purpose of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions from 2025.</P>
        <P>The NPRF Commission publishes annual reports as a statutory obligation and quarterly reports providing an update on the Fund&rsquo;s performance. Both the annual reports and the quarterly reports are available on the Commission&rsquo;s website<i> www.nprf.ie</i></P>
        <P>The market value of the Fund at the end of each year since 2001 was as follows:</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 168, 169 and 189 together. </P>
	<P Just="Left">The Financial Regulator has informed me that the solvency margin calculation set out under the EC Directives determines the minimum acceptable requirement. In practice, in common with the Financial Regulator in Ireland, most EU supervisory authorities insist on solvency being maintained above this minimum requirement, as this allows for supervisory authorities to intervene before a company breaches the minimum requirement of 100% and becomes technically insolvent.</P>
        <P>The application of higher solvency requirements than the minimum also reflects the fact that the existing Solvency regime (Solvency 1) is not sufficiently risk based. This explains why a new insurance directive on solvency requirements has been agreed (Solvency II) which will come into force from 1 January 2013. This regime will harmonise solvency requirements for all insurance companies across the EU.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has also advised my Department that it does not draw a distinction between health insurance and other types of general insurance as the solvency requirements for all non-life insurance companies are the same. Under the conditions of authorisation imposed by the Financial Regulator, all insurance companies must maintain a solvency margin of 200% of the EU minimum requirement for their first three years of operation due to the fact that the risk of financial difficulties arising is higher during this period. After three years they can apply to have the requirements reduced to 150% of the EU minimum requirement. This is the case for all Irish-authorised insurance undertakings.</P>
        <P>Finally, in relation to the specific solvency reserves of individual insurers, this information is not in the public domain due to its commercially sensitive nature.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The figures shown for 2002 relate to individuals only as rental income of companies was returned as excluding capital allowances on the corporation tax return for that year.</P>
        <P>The estimates are based on assuming that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 42% (up to 2006) and 41% (for 2007 and 2008) in respect of individuals and at the standard rate of 25% in respect of companies. The figures provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers.</P>
        <P>The figures for 2008 are subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return form 12 is not captured in the Revenue computer system. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete an income tax return form 11. This return is the source of the figures provided in this reply.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that the level at which interest repayments can be claimed against tax for residential rental properties was reduced from 100% to 75% in section 5 of the Finance Act 2009 at an estimated full year yield of &euro;95 million.</P>

	<P>The position is that an individual&rsquo;s entitlement to mortgage interest relief is based on a year of assessment, which is defined in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 as a calendar year i.e. from 1 January to 31 December.  The administration of the mortgage interest relief is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners in conjunction with the relevant financial institutions. </P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in this particular case the first year of assessment for which the mortgage qualified for mortgage interest relief was 2003 and that entitlement ended on 31 December 2009.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that contact is being made with the individual concerned to confirm that the full relief available was granted for the year 2009.  If there is any additional relief due for 2009, it will be paid by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> his views on whether a cohabiting couple are disadvantaged by the income tax system; his further views on amending the income tax system to provide more favourable tax treatment to cohabiting couples; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Generally speaking, members of cohabiting couples are treated as separate and unconnected individuals for the purpose of income tax.  Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes and credits and bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  The basis for the current taxation of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy v the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit was unaffected by the Murphy Judgement.  Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax credits and standard rate band appropriate to single persons.  </P>
        <P>To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage.  Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples would need to be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI) that the stress-testing exercise relevant to the Deputy&rsquo;s question was carried out by the CBFSAI on Irish credit institutions in 2006. The findings were reported by the CBFSAI in its Financial Stability Report published on 6 November 2006.  The results of this exercise were reported in a signed article in the Financial Stability Report.  </P>
        <P>The stress-testing exercise examined how Irish banks would perform as a result of simultaneous shifts in a number of economic variables. It was assumed that under the adverse scenario that house price inflation would be -13.0 per cent and -8.7 per cent in 2006 and 2007 respectively before growing by 1.1 per cent in 2008. The decline in house prices coupled with the other economic variables produced the broad findings by the banks involved that they could weather the hypothetical scenarios. In the section of the stress test examining the impact of a fall in prices in isolation the analysis found that a 25 per cent fall in house prices coupled with a 10 per cent default rate appeared to yield manageable losses in terms of banks reserves (i.e., the sum of provisions, profits and capital).</P>
        <P>The results of the exercise drew attention to the risks faced by the Irish banking system from an assumed decline in house prices but supported the CBFSAI&rsquo;s central expectation at that time, as reported in the Financial Stability Report, that the current shock-absorption capacity of the banking system left it well placed to withstand pressures from possible adverse economic and sectoral developments, although vulnerabilities and risks to the economic outlook posed continuing difficulties for the banking system.</P>

	<P>Report Stage of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008 is due to be taken in the D&aacute;il shortly.  Once enacted, the Bill will extend the powers of the Ombudsman to cover a significant number of new bodies which, at present, are outside the remit of the Ombudsman. This means that the administrative actions of many public bodies, that were previously not subject to investigation by the Ombudsman, will now be open to impartial and independent scrutiny.   The primary reason to expand the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit at this time is ensure that bodies that are appropriate for inclusion in the remit of the Ombudsman and that have been set up since the Office was established become reviewable.</P>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) was established in May 2007 as part of the government&rsquo;s health reform programme. HIQA is an independent Authority which is responsible for driving quality and safety in Ireland&rsquo;s health and social care services and its functions are based on establishing and regulating standards in health care.</P>
        <P>Bodies with regulatory type functions are being excluded from the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit, at this time, where they have little or no direct dealings with the public and where their interface is normally with commercial entities.</P>
        <P>Given the regulatory role of HIQA and ongoing rationalisation of a number of other bodies the Government will review the bodies included within the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit during the passage of the above mentioned legislation through the Oireachtas.</P>

In a letter to the taxpayer on 23 March 2010, the Revenue Commissioners sought further details in order to process the claim.  To date, no reply to this letter has been received.</P>
        <P>However, the position is that the person is taxed under joint assessment with their spouse for 2009.  Their joint tax affairs for 2009 have now been reviewed without including the claim for medical expenses.  An overpayment of &euro;499.65 arises in respect of the person&rsquo;s spouse.  This amount will transfer to their bank account within 5 working days.  This represents all the tax deducted in relation to both taxpayers in 2009.  Consequently, there is no need for the taxpayer to reply to the letter dated 23 March 2010 as there is no further refund due.</P>

	<P>Detailed information on bondholders of domestic credit institutions&rsquo; senior and subordinated debt is not available. Credit institutions, including Anglo Irish Bank, do not have access to comprehensive information on the holders of their senior and junior, or subordinated debt, because such debt is publicly traded and dealt through clearing house systems. Issuers do not have access to the records of those systems and the issuer has no means of establishing the underlying ownership of its bonds at any given time. Unlike in the case of shares, the holders of credit institutions&rsquo; senior and subordinated debt instruments are not subject to a disclosure regime.</P>

	<P>Exemptions from a broad range of taxes are already available to bodies that are established for charitable purposes only and which apply all of their income for such purposes. Sections 207 and 208 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 provide an exemption from Income Tax and this exemption is extended to cover Corporation Tax by sections 76 and 78 of the same Act.  Exemptions are also available in respect of Capital Gains Tax &mdash; section 609 TCA, Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) &mdash; section 266 TCA, Capital Acquisitions Tax &mdash; sections 17, 22 and 76 of the Capital Acquisitions Taxes Consolidation Act 2003, Stamp Duty &mdash; section 82, Stamp Duties Consolidation Act, 1999 and Dividend Withholding Tax &mdash; Chapter 8A, Part 6, TCA.</P>
        <P>Charities engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT insofar as that they are not required to charge VAT on their services and therefore generally cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services purchased.  However, there are various specific relieving provisions in respect of VAT on vehicles, fuel, aids, appliances, crafts and equipment used by organisations or individuals in connection with disabled people, humanitarian goods for export, rescue groups and donated medical and research equipment.</P>
        <P>Section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 also provides for a scheme of tax relief for donations of money or designated securities to eligible charities and other approved bodies. The precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on such donations varies, depending on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, a person who is subject to self-assessment or a com<Col N="387"/>pany.  Relief from Capital Gains Tax is also available under Section 611 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in relation to the donation of assets by taxpayers to charities.  A comprehensive list of the various tax exemptions available to charities and details of how these can be applied for is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.</P>

	<P>The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) has been established to remove the portfolio of risky assets from the balance sheets of relevant institutions.  It has not been established for the benefit of borrowers, whether their borrowings are above or below &euro;5 million.  Borrowers whose loans are transferred to NAMA will continue to owe the full amount borrowed and the conditions of their loans will generally remain the same. NAMA will manage these loans in the best interest of taxpayers and it will have a range of options to pursue the lender including the seizure of property or other assets which are the security to the loan.</P>
        <P>Of course, I am anxious that jobs and businesses are supported to the maximum extent possible.  In that regard, I have sought to ensure that the banks, which have been supported by the State, comply with their responsibilities.  In relation to small and medium enterprises, specific lending targets &mdash; not to include significant sums in respect of land development and property lending &mdash; were recently imposed by the Government on both AIB and Bank of Ireland.  They will make available for targeted lending not less than &euro;3 billion each in new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011.  This in particular must include funds for working capital for businesses.  This will help to sustain the economy and foster growth.   The lending targets will be reviewed as the needs of the economy change.  To ensure the proper management of these funds the two banks were required to submit SME lending plans both by geography and sector for 2010 and 2011.  Both banks have been informed that the plans must not include significant sums in respect of land development and property lending.   Mr. John Trethowan, as our new Credit Reviewer, will be reviewing bank lending policies as part of his remit.</P>

	<P>Transfers for grades represented by the Civil and Public Services union (mostly Clerical and Staff Officers) are arranged in accordance with formal procedures agreed with the Staff Side at General Council under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Civil Service. Officers in these grades seeking a transfer to another Department or location may apply to the Personnel Officer of the Department in which they wish to serve. The names of officers applying for transfer to a location are entered on the particular Department&rsquo;s transfer lists in the order in which they are received.  Vacancies which arise are then filled by the Department concerned by reference to these lists.</P>
        <P>Transfers for other grades can be arranged on an informal, head-to-head, basis. Such transfers are arranged between the officers seeking to move and the relevant Personnel Units and require the agreement of both Personnel Officers. In addition, a Central Applications Facility (CAF) was established in 2004 and remains open for all staff wishing to apply for posts included in the Decentralisation Programme. Its purpose is:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to give information about locations and posts;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to allow certain public servants to apply for transfer to posts at the same or equivalent level in decentralised  locations;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to rank preferences for different locations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">CAF Applications may be made online through:</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">http://www.publicjobs.ie/publicjobs/en/caf/default.do</P>
        <P>However, the Deputy should note that in light of the budgetary constraints and affordability issues at this time, I have decided to defer proceeding with permanent accommodation in respect of a number of locations.  All deferred locations will be considered as part of the overall review of the programme in 2011.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding a person who is employed in the UK but lives in Ireland with their family and who wishes to pay income tax in Ireland rather than to the UK authorities. </Quest>

<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not open to an individual to choose to pay income tax in any particular jurisdiction. Rather, the individual's income tax liabilities and obligations are governed by the domestic tax legislation of the particular jurisdiction.  Relevant factors in this regard include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />where the individual is resident for tax purposes;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />where the income arises; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />where the duties of a trade, profession or employment are exercised.  In the type of case described, there are generally two scenarios&mdash;</P>
        <P><i>Scenario A </i></P>
<P el="0">If the individual to whom the Question refers is not, under the rules of tax residency, resident in the State for tax purposes and exercises the duties of his or her employment in the UK, then the UK employment income is not taxable here.</P><Col N="390"/>
        <P><i>Scenario B </i></P>
<P el="0">If the individual to whom the Question refers is, under the rules of tax residency, resident in the State for tax purposes and exercises the duties of his or her employment in the UK, then he/she has an obligation to submit a tax return in the State and is liable to tax here on his or her UK employment income.  However, it is likely that the UK employment income will remain liable to UK tax.  Put simply, in this scenario, the individual&rsquo;s UK employment income is taxable both in the UK and here.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This &lsquo;double taxation&rsquo; of the same income may be relieved either under a relief found in Irish domestic tax legislation or under the terms of the Ireland / UK double taxation agreement.  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relief most likely under Irish domestic tax legislation to be relevant in such a case is the relief known as the &lsquo;transborder relief&rsquo; which is designed to give income tax relief to individuals who are resident in the State for tax purposes but who commute daily or weekly to their place of work abroad and who pay tax in the other country on the income from that employment.  Under the Ireland / UK double taxation agreement, in general, the double taxation is relieved by way of Revenue granting a credit against Irish tax due on the UK salary for final UK tax paid on the same salary.  The individual concerned may wish to consult with the Department of Social Protection as regards the PRSI implications of his or her situation.</P>

	<P>Budget 2010 announced that the Government would be considering using the Consumer Price Index as the basis for post-retirement increases for both existing and future public service pensioners. The CPI linkage would displace the linking of public service pensions to earnings, also known as &ldquo;pay parity&rdquo;. The Government is conscious of the substantial long-term saving for the Exchequer which would be expected to materialise were this change to proceed and that it demonstrates a significant level of administrative and fiscal reform.</P>
        <P>The draft Public Service Agreement provides that there will be discussions on the method of pension increases for serving staff and current pensioners in the context of discussions on the review of pay in Spring 2011.  The clarification of the Draft Public Service Agreement issued recently by the facilitators separately indicated that, while I announced in Budget 2010 that I am reviewing the arrangements around indexation of Public Service pensions and considering linking Public Service pensions increases to the cost of living, no change in the indexation arrangements for the indexation of Public Service pensions for serving public servants and current public service pensioners will be implemented during the period of the agreement.</P>

	<P>The Renewed Programme for Government provides for the taking on of 1,000 Third and Fourth level graduates to provide additional <Col N="392"/>capacity and skills across the Public Service and in Government Departments and to provide valuable work experience.  These are work placements as distinct from additional posts in the Public Service.</P>
        <P>My Department would be directly concerned with recruitment to the Civil Service and indirectly with recruitment to the wider public service.  Bearing in mind the Moratorium, Employment Control Frameworks and other factors such as reductions in programme expenditure the scope for graduate recruitment to permanent positions would be limited to small numbers in specialist areas such as taxation, audit, economic/financial skills and IT sections service wide and a few casual vacancies in other disciplines.</P>
        <P>Government Departments will be encouraged to support the F&Aacute;S Work Placement Programme.  The Work Placement Programme, under the auspices of F&Aacute;S, provides valuable work experience for nine months to 2,000 unemployed individuals of which 1,000 of the places are for graduates.

	<P>A gain accruing to an individual on the disposal of an interest in a private residence and grounds of up to one acre, which has been occupied by him/her throughout the period of ownership as his/her only or main residence, is fully relieved from Capital Gains Tax (CGT).  Certain periods of absence are treated as periods of occupation for the purposes of the relief.  For example, the last twelve months of ownership is counted as a period of occupation, which can facilitate an individual who has purchased another private residence and is in the process of selling the previous residence.</P>
        <P>Where an individual occupies a property as his/her principal private residence for part of the period of ownership, any gain made on the disposal of the premises is apportioned and the portion related to periods of occupation or deemed occupation is relieved from CGT.  For example, if an individual occupied a private residence for twenty years, moved to a new home and the old home was not sold for two years, the full period of occupation and the last twelve months of ownership are relieved from CGT and only 1/22 of any gain made on the disposal of the premises is taxable.</P>
        <P>This is already a generous relief and I have no plans at this time to make changes in line with the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion.</P>

I further understand the Deputy to refer to the full or part time employment of retired public servants as part of the staffing of the Department.  As I indicated in a reply to Parliamentary Question No. 149 on 5 May, 2010, records of past employments of new recruits are not captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling the information requested by the deputy.

        <P>Retired public servants are, however, engaged by the Department from time to time for specific tasks or projects.  Such engagements are normally remunerated on a fee basis (provision exists for fees to be abated, where appropriate, by reference to pension payments) but in some cases, indeed, retired public servants have provided their services without any additional remuneration.</P>

	<P>I have responsibility for implementing the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January of this year.</P>
        <P>Children will qualify for a free pre-school year place when they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September each year.  This means that children born between 2 February 2005 and 30 June 2006 qualified for the scheme in January 2010 and children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 will qualify in September 2010.  From the information provided by the Deputy, the child in question was not eligible for the scheme in January this year but will be eligible in September 2010.</P>
        <P>The objective of the ECCE scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to all children in the key developmental year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the pre-school year will be expected to provide appropriate age related activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  Targeting the pre-school year at a particular age cohort is clearly fundamental to the scheme and it is necessary, therefore, to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will participate in the scheme each year.</P>
        <P>In setting the minimum and maximum age limits, account was taken of a number of factors, including the fact that the majority of children commence primary school between the ages of 4 years 6 months and 5 years 6 months.  Notwithstanding this, the ECCE scheme provides for an eligibility range of almost 17 months.  The upper age limit does not apply where children are developmentally delayed and would benefit from participating in the pre-school year at a later age.</P><Col N="394"/>
        <P>As in the case of any scheme introduced, cases will arise where individuals fall outside the conditions which apply.  However, it is necessary that the scheme is delivered within a structure which supports the best delivery of pre-school education and it is considered therefore that the age range provided for is appropriate.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 208, 209 and 223 together.</P>
        <P>Arising from a derogation under the Non-Life Insurance Directives, VHI continues to be exempt from prudential solvency requirements.  The Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2008 provided for the VHI to acquire sufficient funding in terms of its capital reserves to enable it to make an application to the Financial Regulator for authorisation.  The date originally fixed by that Act was 31 December 2008, but this was subject to the right of the Minister to appoint a later date by Order, if satisfied that there is good and sufficient reason for so doing.  At the time the original date was fixed, the Supreme Court had not yet ruled in relation to the risk equalisation scheme, which it struck down in July 2008.  Since then I have extended the date by which the VHI must accrue the necessary reserves on five occasions.  The date is now 1 January 2012.  However, it remains my firm conviction that VHI should be properly authorised and that the derogation should be lifted.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission has commenced proceedings against the State in the European Court of Justice regarding the VHI&rsquo;s derogation.  The State has forwarded a comprehensive written defence to the Court.  The matter of sanctions would only arise in the event of an adverse judgment if nothing was then done to ameliorate the situation and further proceedings were then brought to seek financial penalties against the State.</P>
        <P>Quinn and Aviva both offer a broad range of insurance products across different areas and markets.  Private health insurance constitutes only one aspect of their business, unlike VHI which is restricted in the type and range of insurance it can offer.  Both companies are, quite rightly, subject to regulation by the Financial Regulator in the normal way.</P>
        <P>The capital position and authorisation of the VHI are only two of many inter-related and complex issues that need to be resolved in order to achieve a stable community-rated private health insurance market.</P>
        <P>I have been examining the broad range of issues involved with my officials, expert advisers and the Health Insurance Authority.  The matter has also been considered by the Government <Col N="395"/>on a number of occasions since the Supreme Court Judgement.  I will make a full statement at the appropriate time on the measures required to support the Government&rsquo;s key policy goal of a community-rated health insurance market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I and my officials held a number of meetings with senior health officials and with the Minister for Health during my recent visit to New Zealand.  In the course of those meetings we discussed the role of the Accident Compensation Corporation and the general no fault compensation scheme that operates there.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, an advisory group was established in 2001, to examine the equity, effectiveness and appropriateness of existing arrangements for compensating persons who suffer cerebral damage at, or close to the time of birth, and to make such recommendations as the Group sees fit.  The Group has yet to complete its work.  I will await the Group&rsquo;s report before giving further consideration to a wider no fault compensation scheme for the health services.</P>
        <P>In this country, compensation in many cases involving cerebral damage is dealt with under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme of enterprise liability.  Cerebral Palsy is a complex condition which can be caused by, inter alia, prematurity, developmental brain malformation, neurological damage to the developing brain, hypoxia or medical error.</P>
        <P>I understand that the average time from the institution of proceedings to the ultimate resolution of a typical CP case is now approximately 4 years as a result of the introduction of Enterprise Liability.</P>

	<P>I am conscious that the cancellation of a hospital procedure can be inconvenient and stressful for both patients and their families.  Every effort is made to avoid cancellations where possible.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately cancellations are a feature of hospital systems, in Ireland and internationally because priority must be given to emergency cases and patients in urgent need.  It is important to point out that all cancelled procedures are rescheduled.  While data is not comprehensive the level of cancellations in the Irish public system appears to be broadly in line with other hospital systems internationally.  In 2009, for example, it is estimated that cancellations accounted for about 1.4% of all in-patient and day case activity.</P>
        <P>It should be noted not all cancellations are as a result of hospital capacity or availability.  Cancellations also occur for clinical reasons, where a patient may not be deemed fit for surgery on a given day by the clinician.  For example, the pre-admission assessment might indicate postponing a procedure for clinical reasons such as weight, immune system or blood pressure.</P>
        <P>While it is unfortunate that any patient would have a procedure cancelled, patients waiting over three months can be referred to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  The HSE works with the NTPF to ensure that, where appropriate, patients can avail of treatment under this scheme.</P>
        <P>In 2010, the HSE is focusing on improving the efficiency of acute hospital services by shifting to day case care where appropriate and by seeking performance improvements such as surgery on the day of admission and reducing inappropriate lengths of stay.  There will be a particular focus on reducing the variance between different hospitals for similar procedures.  By reducing costs and reforming the way services are provided, I am confident the HSE will maintain access to services and continue to improve health outcomes for the population.</P>

	<P>As set out in the Health Service Executive National Service Plan 2010, anticipated income from the statutory in patient and out patient charge is budgeted at &euro;216m and &euro;32m respectively.  The out patient charge refers to the &euro;100 which is payable by people who attend A&amp;E departments without a referral letter from a GP.  Medical card holders do not pay this charge.</P>
        <P>The Executive has responsibility for collection of these charges and my Department does not routinely collect information on income raised to date. Accordingly my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE to have a reply issued directly to the <Col N="397"/>Deputy on this matter.  I wish to advise the Deputy that, due to an intensification of industrial action in the public service by members of IMPACT, the HSE may not be in a position to provide a response to this Parliamentary Question at this time.  However, if the issue remains of continuing concern you are invited to raise the matter again in due course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>A person&rsquo;s contribution to care under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is worked out based on 80% of their assessable income and 5% of the value of their assets per annum.  The first &euro;36,000 of a person&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not included at all in the assessment.</P>
        <P>A person&rsquo;s home is only included in the financial assessment for their first three years in long-term nursing home care.  Time spent in nursing home care prior to applying for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is taken into account in calculating the three years.  Assets other than a person&rsquo;s home are taken into account for the duration of their stay in nursing home care.</P>
        <P>Finally, evidence of all assets, e.g. valuations or bank statements, is required to be submitted with a person&rsquo;s application for the scheme.  If a person has previously disclosed assets in connec<Col N="398"/>tion with an application for subvention, they must still provide evidence of these assets when submitting an application under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  This enables the HSE to take account of money that has been spent since the application for subvention to ensure that the person&rsquo;s contribution towards their care is fair.</P>

	<P>It is not possible to disaggregate the amount spent on the quality of disability services from the overall total spent on disability services annually. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, &ldquo;National Quality Standards: Residential Settings for People with Disabilities&rdquo;, which relate to adult services have been published by HIQA. These standards will provide a national framework for quality, safe services for persons with disabilities in a residential setting.</P>
        <P>Given the current economic situation, to move to full statutory implementation of the standards, including regulation and inspection, presents significant challenges at this time.  However, notwithstanding the difficulties of immediate statutory implementation, the Department of Health and Children, the HSE and HIQA have agreed that progressive non-statutory implementation of the standards will now commence, and that they will become the benchmark against which the HSE assesses both its own directly operated facilities and other facilities that the HSE funds.  The Minister for Health and Children will shortly be bringing detailed proposals to Government with regard to the protection of vulnerable adults with disabilities who are currently in institutional care.</P>
        <P>Children with disabilities in generic residential centres under the Child Care Act 1991 are covered by the standards and inspection regimes already applying to those centres.  There are a number of other centres providing residential or respite care to children with disabilities. Children who reside in these centres are not in the care of the State, although they are cared for by the State. The majority of these centres are run by voluntary organisations funded by the HSE and are not included in the inspection regime under the Child Care Act 1991. In relation to the children with disabilities in these other residential centres, the Ryan Commission report recommends that &ldquo;all services for children should be subject to regular inspections in respect of all aspects of their care&rdquo;.  The implementation plan for the recommendations of the Ryan Commission report contains a commitment that the Health Act 2007 will be commenced to allow the independent registration and inspection of all residential centres and respite services for children with a disability by December 2010.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the agency in question is funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE) under section 38 of the Health Act 2004. Existing employment control arrangements for the health services include the HSE and section 38 agencies.</P>
        <P>The Government has made clear that a critical part of its strategy to restore the public finances is to achieve sustainability in the cost of delivering public services relative to State revenues. To help achieve this goal, it will be necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and to reduce public service numbers over the coming years. This requires that the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the health service will continue to apply until the numbers have fallen to the level set out in the Employment Control Framework for the health sector. The Framework for 2010-2012 gives effect to the Government decision on employment policy in the public sector and provides that there will be a net reduction in employment to 2012. This includes a target reduction in numbers in 2010 to achieve the overall reduction of 6,000 from March 2009 to the end 2012 and consequential pay roll savings. Based on numbers reductions already achieved in 2009, the net target reduction to end 2012 is 4,560 WTE (or 1,520 per annum). Similar to 2009, there are a number of grades exempted from the <Col N="401"/>moratorium to maintain key front line services and to support the development of policies in relation to disability, mental health, cancer, and child care.</P>

        <P>Grant aided agencies (funded under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004) are not directly affected by the pay adjustments provided for under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No 2) Act 2009. Section 39 agencies are not public service bodies as defined in that Act and their employees are not public servants. Therefore, the Employment Control Framework 2010-2012 (including the moratorium on recruitment) does not cover section 39 agencies.</P>
        <P>However, the grant funding of Section 39 Agencies is subject to the general efficiency savings for the health sector provided for in the Budget.   Accordingly, it is entirely appropriate that Section 39 Agencies and other HSE funded voluntary providers take appropriate measures to ensure that they continue to provide the same level of service in 2010 as previously, notwithstanding the reductions in their funding.  It is the responsibility of each individual employer to decide exactly what mix of actions should be taken to achieve this goal, to take appropriate legal and other advice, to consult and inform its employees/trade unions as necessary and to manage the HR and industrial relations implications of its decisions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 to 236, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers, the Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade, with effect from 27 March 2009. The Employment Control Framework for 2010-2012 gives effect to the Government decision on employment policy in the public sector. It provides that there will be a net reduction in employment to 2012. This includes a target reduction in numbers in 2010 to achieve the overall reduction of 6,000 from March 2009 to the end 2012 and consequential pay roll savings. Based on numbers reductions already achieved in 2009, the net target reduction to end 2012 is 4,560 WTE (or 1,520 per annum).</P>
        <P>Similar to 2009, there are a number of grades exempted from the moratorium to maintain key front line services and to support the development of policies in relation to disability, mental health, cancer, and child care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The numbers of relevant grades cited in the question are set out in the following table:</P>

	<P>As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have responsibility for a broad range of policies and services which impact directly on children and young people&rsquo;s well being.  In this context, I recently launched the research report by One Family on the Need for Child Contact Centres in Ireland. I understand that One Family was supported in carrying out this research with funding from the Family Support Agency.</P>
        <P>Child and Family Contact Centres are intended to provide safe and reliable environments for parents and children to maintain family contact, often where difficult circumstances or family breakdown apply.  I am strongly aware that the Ryan Report recommended that children in care should not, save in exceptional circumstances, be cut off from their families and priority should be given to supporting ongoing contact with family members for the benefit of the child.</P>
        <P>In giving consideration to the best way to meet the recommendations, I think it is important that the potential role in this regard of Child and Family Contact Centres is looked at.  For this reason, I have asked officials in my Office to bring forward a detailed proposal to establish a Child and Family Contact Centre on a pilot basis, with a view to considering the best model for future service provision on a wider scale.</P>

	<P>As this is a service matter, the question would in the normal course of events be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply. This is not possible due to industrial action.</P>
        <P>However, I can advise that waiting times for referrals to symptomatic breast services were set by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) in its 2007 National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services. The most recently-available performance indicator statistics for urgent and routine referrals showed the standards being exceeded across all cancer centres as a whole (standards are for 95% of urgent referrals to be seen within two weeks and 95% of routine referrals to be seen within 12 weeks).</P>
        <P>In relation to the greater Dublin area specifically, both cancer centres in the Dublin North East region exceeded the standard for urgent referrals and in Dublin Mid-Leinster, one of two centres exceeded the standard. For routine referrals, in Dublin North East one of two centres exceeded the standard while in Dublin Mid-Leinster, both centres exceeded the standard. In February 2010, HIQA published its Report into the Quality and Safety of Symptomatic Breast Disease Services in Ireland. It found that the centres were meeting the key requirements of the National Quality Assurance Standards.</P>

	<P>The Government has made clear that a critical part of its strategy to restore the public finances is to achieve sustainability in the cost of delivering public services relative to State revenues. To help achieve this goal, it will be necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and to reduce public service numbers over the coming years. This requires that the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the health service will continue to apply until the numbers have fallen to the level set out in the Employment Control Framework for the health sector.  The Employment Control Framework for 2010-2012 gives effect to the Government decision on employment policy in the public sector. It provides that there will be a net reduction in employment to 2012. This includes a target reduction in numbers in 2010 to achieve the overall reduction of 6,000 from March 2009 to the end 2012 and consequential pay roll savings. Based on numbers reductions already achieved in 2009, the net target reduction (for the Health Sector) to end 2012 is 4,560 WTE (or 1,520 per annum).</P><Col N="405"/>

        <P>Matters such as the staffing and funding of the HPV vaccination programme are, in the first instance, the responsibility of the HSE and I wish to advise the Deputy that, due to industrial action affecting the HSE, it is not possible for the Executive to supply the information requested.  If this matter remains of continuing concern to you, however, I would invite you to raise it with me again in due course.</P>
        <P>However, the HPV vaccine will be provided free to first year girls in secondary school rather than a specific age group.  The vaccination schedule requires three doses of the vaccination to be given over the course of a six month period.  Evidence from other countries (UK and Australia) has shown that the highest uptake rates are achieved when HPV vaccine is administered in schools (3rd dose uptakes of over 80% versus less than 65% for GP administration).  I am satisfied that the policy of delivering the vaccination programme mainly in school settings is the most appropriate one.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Below-cost selling of alcohol products was one of the areas examined by the Government Alcohol Advisory Group in 2008.  However, due to the complex pricing systems which it encountered during its examination of the issue, the Group was unable to establish any standard costs for the purposes of prohibiting below-cost sales of such products.  On 31st March, 2009 the Government agreed to include alcohol in a National Substance Misuse Strategy that would be co-ordinated jointly by the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs and my Department.  A Steering Group has been established to develop the alcohol element of the National Substance Misuse Strategy.  It will base its recommendations on evidence based <Col N="410"/>measures to deal with the significant public health issue of alcohol in areas such as supply, pricing, prevention, treatment, awareness and education.  The Steering Group is currently meeting on a monthly basis and it is expected that its Report will be submitted to Government by the end of this year.</P>

	<P>The Government recently published the third report of Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, Special Rapporteur on Child Protection.</P>
        <P>Mr. Shannon was appointed in the aftermath of the &lsquo;CC case&rsquo; (sometimes referred to as the &lsquo;A Case&rsquo;) and was required to review and audit national and international legislative developments for the protection of children, and to prepare, annually from 2007 to 2009, a report setting out the results of the previous year&rsquo;s work.</P><Col N="411"/>
        <P>In his 2009 report Mr. Shannon makes a number of recommendations and observations in relation to areas under the remit of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA), including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the <i>Children First</i> National Guidelines;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />HIQA inspections;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />evaluation of child care services;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the use of a &lsquo;Differential Response Model&rsquo; as an alternative model for the promotion of child welfare and protection;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />mandatory reporting;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />future inquiries into matters concerning children.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The OMCYA is actively engaged in all the aforementioned matters.  Mr. Shannon&rsquo;s report also considers issues of relevance to the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  Mr. Shannon&rsquo;s three reports have helped to inform the approach to strengthening the policy and legislative framework covering child welfare and protection.  The Government has re-appointed Mr. Shannon for a further term of three years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the Supreme Court decision of July 2008, which found the Irish Risk Equalisation Scheme to be <i>ultra vires,</i> the Government decided to introduce an interim scheme of loss compensation.  This was provided for under the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, covering the period 2009 to early 2012.</P>
        <P>In any community rated health insurance market, a comprehensive risk equalisation or loss compensation system is required in order for the market to operate in the best interests of all consumers.  Without a risk equalisation or loss compensation system, insuring older or ill people will be loss making.  As a result, insurers that cover a higher proportion of older people will be at a significant competitive disadvantage and insurers will seek to avoid insuring older people.  It follows that, without risk equalisation or loss compensation, competition will not function properly and the market will operate counter to the interests of ill and older people.  This is why it is the international norm for risk equalisation or loss compensation to apply in community rated markets.</P>
        <P>At my request, the Health Insurance Authority has started work on preparing a comprehensive risk equalisation scheme to replace the interim scheme of loss compensation when it expires.  Risk equalisation is one of a number of key elements in a community rated system.  I have raised this and the other key issues relating to the private health insurance market with Government and I will make a further statement on the matter at the appropriate time.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive engaged Counsel in 2007 to carry out the non-statutory inquiry referred to by the Deputy.   The Inquiry&rsquo;s Report was delivered to the HSE in October 2009.  Following receipt of the report two of the parties requested that they be allowed make further submissions and these requests were granted.  The submissions were made in early 2010 and were considered by the inquiry.  It is my clear understanding, from the HSE, that none of the parties are now being asked to sign a non disclosure agreement.  The question of dissemination of the Report is a matter for the Executive and I understand that it is considering a number of options for the release of the Report. </P>

	<P>It is estimated that 23,750 older people are in long term residential care with a total provision, public, private and voluntary, of approx 30,000 places altogether.  The overall place number includes long-stay, respite, convalescence and palliative care beds. These consist of over 10,000 public places in Health Service Executive (HSE) facilities and 20,000 places in private and voluntary settings nationally.</P>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority had registered 593 designated centres for older people in accordance with the Health Act 2007 (Registration of Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations, 2009 (S.I. no. 245 of 2009) on 31 December, 2009. These consisted of 450 private nursing homes, 124 nursing homes run by the Health Services Executive (HSE) and 19 nursing homes run by voluntary organisations.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is now the single system of financial support for individuals who require long-term nursing home care. The scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes.  The HSE is provided with a set level of funding for the scheme each year. While it is hoped that there would be sufficient funding to support everyone, there may be situation where a person&rsquo;s name must go onto a waiting list until funding becomes available. If this is the case, the HSE will notify the individual. There is no waiting list for funding at present.</P>

	<P>Under the National Plan for Radiation Oncology (NPRO), there will be a network of four radiotherapy centres and two satellite centres by 2014.  The four main centres will be located at Beaumont, St James&rsquo;s, Cork and Galway plus two satellite centres at Limerick and Waterford.  It is intended that services at the existing facility in St Luke&rsquo;s in Dublin will have transferred in full to Beaumont and St James&rsquo;s by the end of 2014.  This decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology is integrated with all other aspects of cancer care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.</P>
        <P>The Board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government&rsquo;s decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology and a Transition Team has been established to oversee developments.</P>
        <P>Phase 1 of the NPRO involves the construction of new facilities at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont Hospital and is currently under way and on target for completion by the end of this year. Some staff and resources will transfer from St Luke&rsquo;s to the new centres in the latter half of this year. St Luke&rsquo;s will continue to provide radiation oncology services for the period up to the completion of the NPRO in 2014. During this period St Luke&rsquo;s will, together with the new facilities, form a Radiation Oncology Network for Dublin and the East. To facilitate the operation of the Network, St Luke&rsquo;s will be incorporated into the HSE from July this year.</P>
        <P>These developments will ensure increased radiation oncology capacity in the Dublin and Eastern region from the end of this year. Additional linear accelerators were also provided at St Luke&rsquo;s in 2008 in order to provide sufficient capacity in the interim before completion of the NPRO in 2014.</P>
        <P>No decisions have yet been taken in relation to the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke&rsquo;s.  However, I am anxious to ensure that these resources are utilised in the best interest of the health services. I understand that the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s are preparing a report on possible future uses of the site and facilities and I hope to receive a copy of this report shortly.</P>

	<P>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants paid by my Department.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. </P>
        <P>On 22nd February, I announced the 2010 regional and local road grant allocations.  A total of &euro;411.409 million is being provided to local authorities this year for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads.</P><Col N="423"/>
        <P>In deciding on allocations for 2010 the first priority was to ensure the protection of the existing road network and, particularly the massive Exchequer investment of &euro;6 billion in regional and local road grants since 1997.  It is important that resources are therefore targeted to address, on a priority basis, the most urgently required repairs resulting from the extensive damage caused by the prolonged severe weather.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have been asked to carefully re-assess their planned road programmes for 2010 having regard to these priorities.</P>
        <P>In August 2009, Cork County Council submitted a proposal for funding the land acquisition and construction of this project in 2010 and beyond.  The estimated cost of this project is approximately &euro;18.5 million.</P>
        <P>Since then I have met with local representatives and Deputy Michael McGrath regarding this issue.  I recently wrote to Cork County Council (through local Deputy Michael McGrath) raising a number of issues and I am awaiting their response.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Delivery of aeronautical maritime search and rescue commenced in Ireland in September 1991 with the transfer of the Shannon base to civilian service delivery.  The entire national aeronautical maritime search and rescue service has been fully transferred to contract delivery since 2004.  The Air Corps provides support to the Coast Guard as the need arises and within their available capability, in accordance with the roles assigned by Government in the White Paper on Defence.  The Air Corps was withdrawn from maritime search and rescue in 2004 and there are no plans to reconsider this decision.  Current Air Corps helicopter assets are not configured for maritime search and rescue nor does it have pilots or winch men with the required training and experience to support such operations. </P>
        <P>Air Corps funding is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Defence. However I am advised that there are no specific funds allocated from the Defence Vote for the provision of search and rescue services by the Air Corps.</P>
        <P>The Government has recently approved a continuance of the current arrangements for provision of maritime search and rescue capability in Ireland using modern helicopters.  The new contract, which will run to 2023, will represent a stepped improvement in the capacity, range, speed and capability of the service. It is a major advancement for search and rescue in Ireland at a time of serious budgetary constraints.</P>

Large public service vehicles (buses) are permitted to use all bus lanes.  Several exemptions are provided in the regulations.  Pedal cyclists are regarded as being vulnerable road users and, on road safety grounds, are permitted to use with-flow bus lanes.  Taxis are available for hire on-street to the public at large and are regarded as being an element of the public transport service.  They are, accordingly, permitted to use with-flow bus lanes.  </P>

The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.

	<P>The case of the person concerned was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  On 23 March 2010, I refused the person concerned permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.</P>
        <P>If new information or circumstances have come to light, which have a direct bearing on his case and which have arisen since the original decision to deport was made, there remains the option of applying to me for revocation of his Deportation Order pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended.  However I wish to make clear that such an application would require substantial grounds to be successful.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is, and remains, an operational matter for the GNIB.</P>

	<P>This person&rsquo;s case falls under the Dublin II Regulation, (Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003).  The Dublin II Regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of &lsquo;asylum shopping&rsquo; across Europe and <Col N="427"/>sets out criteria for determining which Regulation State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one Regulation State or whereby an asylum seeker has been granted a visa to enter another Regulation State and has entered that other State before entering Ireland and making an asylum application here.  At the same time, it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of &lsquo;refugees in orbit&rsquo;, a situation which had previously pertained in Europe.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, (ORAC), determined on 27 February, 2009, in accordance with the terms of the Dublin II Regulation, that Spain is responsible for examining this person&rsquo;s asylum application.  A Transfer Order was signed in respect of this person on 10 March, 2009,  and they were requested to present themselves to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 16 March, 2009.  He failed to present as requested and is now recorded as having evaded his transfer.  He is currently illegally present in this State and is liable to be arrested and detained without further notice.  He should make himself known to the Garda National Immigration Bureau without further delay so that final arrangements can be made for his transfer to Spain.</P>

However, the person referred to can resubmit the correspondence to the Visa section to allow for any issues raised to be addressed.</P>
        <P>While officials of my Department regularly meet with representative bodies who act on behalf of groups of stakeholders in the area of immigration generally and visas in particular, resource constraints dictate that it is quite rare for meetings to take place with individual businesses, including individual schools or colleges.  Most routine issues raised in relation to visa matters are more appropriately and efficiently dealt with by way of written correspondence, e-mail or by telephone.  Exceptions to this general rule may occasionally be made if matters of unusual importance or urgency are raised.  It is open to the person referred to by the Deputy to write to the Visa section outlining any such exceptional or urgent issues and the reasons why they feel that a meeting is warranted.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that as at 6 May 2010, the number of cars within the Garda fleet is 2,014, of which 957 are over four years old.  Over the last number of years there has been a sustained programme of investment in Garda vehicles in terms of maintenance, running expenses and new purchases amounting to some &euro;72 million in the period 2007 to <Col N="429"/>2009.  This level of investment has resulted in both the expansion of the fleet and the lowering of its age profile with consequent benefits to Garda members in terms of health and safety and lower maintenance costs.</P>
        <P>I am further advised by the Garda authorities that they are developing a Request for Tender with a view to purchasing more new vehicles later this year.  The Garda Commissioner has stated that the benefits of these investments in the Garda fleet will be sustained into 2011 and beyond.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 11 February 2005.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 7 March 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>
        <P>Due to the high volume of cases on hand, it is not possible to expedite the case of the person concerned.  However, a commitment has been given to have his case finalised by 29 April 2011 at the latest with every effort being made to have it finalised in advance of that date.</P>

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in December 2007.</P>
        <P>All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee. In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is at an advanced stage and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 11 April 2007.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 21 August 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

	<P>The person concerned is the subject of a  Deportation Order following a comprehensive and thorough examination of his asylum claim and of his application to remain temporarily in the State. He has been evading his deportation since 19 May 2005 and should he come to the notice of the Garda&iacute;, he would be liable to arrest and detention. He should, therefore, present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau without any further delay.</P>
        <P>As a matter of policy, I do not intend to reward persons who have failed a very fair and comprehensive asylum process, and who have thereafter proceeded to evade their deportation for several years, by granting such persons residency in the State. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there has been a change in the circumstances of the person concerned, or new information has come to light which has a direct bearing on his case, there remains the option of applying to me for revocation of his Deportation Order pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended. However I wish to make clear that such an application would require substantial grounds to be successful.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has re-affirmed its commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin and also approved the launch of a new tendering process for the construction of a more affordable and better value prison campus at Thornton. The aim is to provide good quality, regime focussed prison accommodation with appropriate support and rehabilitative facilities for prisoners to prepare them for re-integration back into society. </P>
        <P>As previously stated, the new prison facility will provide accommodation for 1,400 cells with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 in a range of security settings and facilities. The Irish Prison Service is satisfied that the scope and scale of the project is appropriate given the current level of committals.</P>
        <P>The development of the new prison at Thornton Hall, County Dublin is proceeding on a phased basis. Phase one comprises essential enabling works required for the prison development. These works include the construction of the dedicated access road, perimeter security wall and various  off-site services. Phase two of the project comprises the various prisoner accommodation blocks, workshops, education facilities and administration buildings.</P>
        <P>Tenders for the design and construction of the access road to serve the prison development were issued in March of this year. The competition is still in progress and it is anticipated that contract award will take place in June with construction work commencing on site in July.</P>
        <P>It is intended that tender documents for various off-site works will be issued later this month with construction work expected to commence in September this year.  The tender documentation for the design and construction of the perimeter wall of the prison is currently at an advanced stage of preparation. It is intended to invite tenders for this phase of the project by the end of September with the construction work commencing immediately following the completion of the access road in January 2011. The construction of the perimeter wall is estimated to take about 12 months to complete.</P>
        <P>In relation to the main prison development, the National Development Finance Agency acting on behalf of the Irish Prison Service, has initiated an EU wide tender competition for the appointment of multi-disciplinary technical advisors for the project. The technical advisors will develop the output specification and other tender documents which will be the subject of a tender competition later this year. It is anticipated that the prison will be operational within 3 years from the commencement of the construction of the main prison campus.</P>
        <P>The detailed design of the new prison has not yet been finalised. When designing a new prison, the Irish Prison Service must take into consideration a wide range of factors. These include the need to provide sufficient accommodation to meet current and future committals from the courts, the need to provide safe, secure custody for offenders and, the provision of appropriate rehabilitation services in order to prepare offenders for re-integration back in to society on completion of their sentence.</P>

	<P>The family referred to by the Deputy comprise a husband and wife and their four children, all of whom are <Col N="436"/>Romanian citizens.  The first named person applied for asylum on 17 June 2002 and this application included two of the children.  The second named person applied for asylum on 22 July 2002 and this application included the couple&rsquo;s other two children.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of their respective asylum claims, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), they were separately notified, she by letter dated 14 July 2005 and he by letter dated 23 September 2005, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them and their children.  They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against them and their children.  Representations were received on their behalf at that time.</P>
        <P>As stated already, the persons concerned are Romanian citizens and, since the accession of Romania to the European Union (EU) on 1 January 2007, citizens of Romania are, in terms of immigration controls, covered by the provisions of the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations, 2006.  This means they have the same rights of access to the Republic of Ireland as a citizen of an existing EU Member State, with the exception of access to the labour market.  As a result, since that date no further consideration can be given to a Romanian citizen&rsquo;s case under the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). This position has been confirmed by the High Court in the Judgment of Mr. Justice Cooke in B &amp; Anor v MJELR [2009] IEHC 333, 16th July 2009.  In this case the High Court was satisfied that the Minister has no power since 1 January 2007 to make a decision under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) in relation to a Romanian national.  Therefore, no further consideration can or will be given to the cases of the persons concerned in the context of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 29 June 2005.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 7 November 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Commission&rsquo;s report on the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin was published last November.  The Commission is at present examining the Diocese of Cloyne, and the Government extended the Commission&rsquo;s term to 30 June to allow this work to be completed.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigations of the Assistant Commissioner appointed by the Garda Commissioner to examine the findings of the Dublin Archdiocese report relating to the handling of complaints and investigations by both Church and State authorities are ongoing.  He will complete his investigations expeditiously with a view to reporting to the Commissioner as early as possible.  When he reports to the Commissioner with his recommendations, the Commissioner will consult with the DPP as to what issues arise in the context of criminal liability.</P>
        <P>I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs that the Health Service Executive (HSE) is currently in the process of completing its audit of Catholic dioceses to ensure that it, as the statutorily responsible body, is fully aware of all cases of clerical child sex abuse known to the Church.  It is hoped that the HSE will submit its report to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in the near future.  Consideration of the results of all these investigations will include consideration of what further actions require to be taken, including a possible extension of the Commission&rsquo;s remit.</P>

My colleague, the Minister for Finance has responsibility for Betting under the Betting Acts 1931 and 1994, as amended and for the National Lottery under the National Lottery Act 1986.</P>
        <P>The current arrangements governing gaming and lotteries do not provide me with the facility to conduct the type of research &mdash; some of which could be of a clinical nature &mdash; envisaged by the Deputy.  However, as the Deputy is aware, I have initiated a major review of gambling from within my own Department.  The review will provide Government with options for a new and comprehensive legal and organisational framework governing the gambling architecture in the State.  Three important considerations which are the hallmark of most well-regulated gambling codes inform the review.  These are:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /> that young people and the vulnerable are protected</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /> that gambling should in all respects be fairly and openly conducted and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /> that gambling is kept free of crime.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The consultation phase of the review has now been completed.   Following the settling of policy in relation to a new gambling architecture for the State, the House can expect the publication of legislative proposals in the normal course.   I envisage that the costs associated with ensuring adherence to standards are met by the industry as part of the licensing arrangements, and that in that context the industry contributes the cost of properly commissioned and independently <Col N="441"/>undertaken research into aspects of gambling, particularly into problem and compulsive gambling.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 364 and 365 together.</P>
        <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that on 17 May 2010 there were 859 prisoners on temporary release. With the exception of certain categories of prisoner, most notably those serving life sentences, all prisoners are entitled to remission of their sentence at a rate of 25% of the term they have been sentenced to.  It is not possible to provide figures and a breakdown of offences to the Deputy as requested as this would require the manual examination of records going back over a considerable time period. Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that the Minister may approve the temporary release of a sentenced prisoner.  This discretionary instrument assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release, in administering short sentences, in addressing humanitarian issues and can be an incentive to well-behaved prisoners. It should be noted that a prisoner on temporary release is still subject to his or her sentence and may be returned to prison without any court intervention.</P>
        <P>Temporary release arrangements are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence. Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender&rsquo;s Garda Station. Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda&iacute;.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau that there is no requirement or obligation on Immigration Officers, nor is it common practice, to ensure that the attention of non visa required nationals is drawn to the requirements that can be asked of them by Immigration officers at a point of entry.  However, if a person has a specific enquiry regarding the immigration requirements of this State, it is open to them to visit the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website; www.inis.gov.ie.</P>

	<P>I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation (GBFI) is currently investigating a wide range of cases of what might be regarded as white collar crime and, where appropriate does so in collaboration with other statutory authorities.  I am further advised that the Bureau has sufficient resources available to it to investigate this type of criminality, and where additional personnel are required they have been made available to the appointed senior investigating officers. The GBFI has also recently trained additional personnel attached to divisions outside the Dublin Metropolitan Region in fraud investigation techniques to enable them to investigate less serious cases locally and support GBFI in its national responsibilities.</P>
        <P>I have informed the Garda Commissioner that I am prepared to bring forward any changes to the criminal law which would enhance the ability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate white collar crime, and, in this context, I have asked him to look at the law in this area and let me have any proposals he might consider desirable in the public interest.  The issue of white collar crime will also be addressed as part of the process of the preparation of a White Paper on Crime, which is taking place at present.</P>

	<P>A passport application for the named person was registered with the Passport Office in London on 12 April, 2010.  As a direct result of the industrial action, significant arrears of passport applications have arisen within the passport service.

It is presently taking up eight weeks to process Passport applications in London. However, I understand that <Col N="444"/>the application in question will be issued in time for travel.

	<P>As a direct result of ongoing industrial action by the Civil Public and Services Union (CPSU), significant arrears of passport applications have arisen within the Passport Service. There are currently approximately 66,000 passport applications waiting to be processed within the system and it is presently taking up to twenty two working days to process individual applications. Applications, other than those that are prioritised on the basis of demonstrable urgent humanitarian need, are being processed on a first come first served basis.  The dispute is having a severe impact on the travelling public. Unfortunately, there are citizens whose trips abroad have had to be cancelled and holiday and work plans severely disrupted.</P>
        <P>Every effort is being made to reduce the waiting time for applications, pending the resolution of the industrial action which is preventing the recruitment of temporary staff to address the seasonal surge in demand for passports. Staff have been working overtime for some weeks and this has kept the level of increase in the backlog to a minimum and in recent days seen a marginal reduction in this level.</P>
        <P>However, the backlog in passport applications can and will be overcome when the CPSU call off their industrial action and co-operate with the recruitment of temporary staff normally engaged at this time of year. My Department has obtained the necessary sanction to recruit the temporary staff and arrangements have been made for staff to commence work at short notice. I would once again call on the CPSU to withdraw this restriction and to allow a significant number of currently unemployed workers to take on paid employment and assist in reducing the sizeable backlog of passport applications.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s current advice to passport applicants is available on the website www.passport.ie:</P>
        <P el="5">1. Before making any overseas travel plans, customers should check passport expiry dates and submit any applications in sufficient time before the intended date of travel.</P>
       <P el="5">2. Photocopy the photograph page of any existing passport being renewed, include with the application form and retain the existing passport.</P>
        <P el="5">3. The recommended method for submitting passport applications is via the Passport Express service or Royal Mail NIPX service, available through local post offices.</P>
      <P el="5">4. Applications submitted through this service are currently being processed up to 22 working days from the date of receipt. The turnaround time for applications submitted through Irish Embassies abroad should in the 1st instance be checked on the relevant Embassy website.</P>
        <P el="5">5. Projected turnaround times for the issuing of passports are regularly updated and available at www.passport.ie</P><Col N="445"/>
        <P el="5">6. The public counters and out of hours services should only be used by those who have a necessity to travel for reasons of family emergency. i.e. travel is necessitated by the death, illness or welfare of a family member.</P>
      <P el="5">7. All other applications should be submitted through the Passport Express channel.</P>
       <P el="5">8. Customers should retain the barcode number on their passport application and use this number to check the status of their application on the Passport Service website: www.passport.ie . This should be the primary contact point for information and the site is updated several times a day.</P>
     <P el="5">9. Any queries on applications should be e-mailed using the contact details page on the website and should include the barcode number. These e-mails will be dealt with in order of receipt.</P>
        <P el="5">10. Customers who have made arrangements to collect their passport, should not call to the public counter until they have confirmed on the website that the relevant passport is ready for collection.</P>

	<P>Cooperation with development Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) represents a very important element of the Government&rsquo;s aid programme, administered by Irish Aid. We consistently channel a higher proportion of our overall assistance through the non-governmental sector than most other international donors, reflecting the strong support of the Irish people for the work of NGOs and missionaries. </P>
        <P>So far this year, Irish Aid has provided &euro;56 million in funding to Irish NGOs. I expect that total funding for 2010 will be over &euro;100 million. In 2009, over &euro;114 million was provided to Irish development NGOs, and in 2008 over &euro;145 million. This funding is provided to support the long term development work of NGOs, in accordance with the central objective of the Government&rsquo;s aid programme, to make an effective Irish contribution to the fight against global poverty and hunger. Funding is also provided to support emergency and humanitarian assistance, and work in the area of development education. Through Irish Aid, the Government provided funding to over 170 Irish NGOs last year.  The following is an outline of all funding to Irish NGOs in 2008 and 2009, and funding provided to date in 2010.</P>

        <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport in March this year, there was one formal meeting of the Education, Youth and Culture Council which I was entitled to attend on 10th May 2010.  I had planned to attend this meeting but unfortunately I was unable to do so due to pressing domestic tourism commitments relating to the volcanic ash disruption. <Col N="451"/> As set out above the Deputy Permanent Representative, Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union, Brussels deputised on my behalf at this meeting.</P>
        <P>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, I participated in an ad hoc video conference with EU Tourism Ministers on 28th April to discuss the impact on tourism business across the EU as a result of the volcanic ash disruption.</P>

        <P>The specific information requested is not available for all departmental staff as records of past employments of new recruits are not captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling the information requested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>However, I can confirm that none of my political staff or my special adviser are currently drawing down pension payments on foot of previous public sector employment.</P>
        <P>Retired public servants are occasionally engaged by the Department for specific tasks or projects.  Such engagements are normally remunerated on a fee basis where provision exists for the fees to be abated, where appropriate, by reference to pension payments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Dormant Accounts Fund Acts provide for an annual transfer by credit institutions and insurance undertakings of monies in accounts determined to be dormant into the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF).  Since its establishment in May 2003 to end-March 2010, the net transfers to the DAF have totalled some &euro;326m.</P>
        <P>The value of the DAF at end-March 2010, net of liabilities, was some &euro;42m.  This excludes the amount of some &euro;46m currently maintained in a Reserve Account to meet reclaims and to cover expenses.  The reserve is currently set at 15% of the total monies received by the Fund and not yet reclaimed.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to wind up the DAF but the Deputy may wish to note that the Government plans to publish legislation in the coming months dissolving the Dormant Accounts Board.</P>
        <P>Further details of the projects to which funding has been allocated to date and a summary of the status of the DAF are available on my Department&rsquo;s website</P>

	<P>The following table sets out the details requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of persons employed in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, An Foras Teanga, Waterways Ireland, the Western Development Commission and other agencies funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote Group.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding the target number at which point the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service will end, the precise ceilings in each area are subject to any future Government policy decisions and priorities in regard to public service provision. The Government will keep the application of the moratorium on recruitment and promotion under review and the matter will be revisited in each sector as the staffing levels in the Employment Control Frameworks for the sectors are achieved.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also requested details in relation to An Foras Teanga and Waterways Ireland, both of which are North/South Implementation Bodies that come under the remit of my Department. Details in relation to numbers employed in those Bodies are also reflected in the following table. However, I must stress to the Deputy that these bodies are exempt from the requirements of the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service and other public service number reducing measures. It should also be noted that neither of the Bodies have yet met their approved staffing complement and are in the process of recruiting staff, in line with approvals from the Departments of Finance in both jurisdictions and the North/South Ministerial Council.</P>

	<P>I am advised by Waterways Ireland that the requisite physical survey has been completed and that work on the necessary environmental assessments is due for completion in autumn 2010.  Following completion of these studies and final design estimates, it is anticipated that planning permission will be sought towards the end of the year.  Following a successful outcome to the planning process, it is anticipated that the land acquisition process could then commence and the contract for construction could be awarded in 2011.</P>

	<P>I understand the Deputy to refer to the employment of retired public servants as part of the staffing of my Department and Office, including offices under the aegis of my Department.   Records of past employments of new recruits are not captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling the information requested by the Deputy.  Accordingly, the specific information requested is not available.</P>
        <P>Retired public servants are, however, engaged by my Department and offices under the aegis of my Department, from time to time for specific tasks or projects.  Such engagements are normally remunerated on a fee basis (provision exists for fees to be abated, where appropriate, by reference to pension payments) but in some cases, indeed, retired public servants have provided their services without any additional remuneration.</P>

	<P>It was not possible to estimate the number of families who would be eligible but do not apply for family income supplement (FIS) entitlements.</P>
        <P>The department completed a research project in 2008 to examine factors behind the level of take up for the scheme. This research project included a survey of over 3,000 families which appeared to satisfy conditions for receipt of FIS.  From over 1,000 valid responses received the survey identified that 23% might be eligible for this scheme.</P>
        <P>The research also found that overall awareness of family income supplement<b> </b>among potential recipients is high with nearly three in four claiming to have heard of the scheme.  Despite high levels of awareness, there was a lack of awareness and understanding of the eligibility requirements with only one in three claiming to be aware of the qualifying criteria for FIS.</P>
        <P>The report recommends that the department needs to ensure that information about the scheme is advertised in a focused way with the eligibility and qualification criteria communicated as clearly as possible.  The department is addressing this by ensuring such information is highlighted as part of its ongoing information strategy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 393, 418 and 421 together.</P>
        <P>The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  In particular, the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population. There are currently six workers for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050.</P>
        <P>Increasing state pension age is one of the ways in which we can sustain the pensions system and also maintain the value of the State Pension at 35% of average earnings. People are living longer and healthier lives with average life expectancy set to rise even further in the future, up to 89 years for women and 83 for men. People will still, therefore, be spending at least the same amount of time in retirement as they are today, even with a later State pension age.</P>
        <P>Therefore, as announced as part of the National Pensions Framework, the State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the removal of the State pension (transition), thereby standardising State pension age at 66.  This means that the last group of people to receive the State pension (transition) will be those who reach 65 years of age in 2013.  State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</P>
        <P>The details and timeframes for these changes are set out in the National Pensions Framework, which was published on 3 March 2010. The Government&rsquo;s plan for future pension reform in Ireland encompasses all aspects of pensions, from social welfare to private occupational pensions and public sector pension reform.   The aim of the framework is to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State.  It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and to ensure that state support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.</P>
        <P>Implementation group chaired by my Department has been established to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the necessary reforms into operation.</P>

	<P>Payment of invalidity pension, to the person concerned, was disallowed by a Deciding Officer following an examination by a Medical Assessor of the Department who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work. An appeal was opened and in the context of that appeal, her case was reviewed by a second Medical Assessor who also expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, in the light of this second medical opinion, that office decided to afford her an opportunity of setting out the complete and up to date grounds of her appeal.  The person concerned has submitted additional medical evidence which has been forwarded to the Chief Medical Advisor for his opinion.</P>

	<P>The person concerned made a claim for medical appliance benefit under his own PPS Number. As he does not have sufficient reckonable PRSI contributions in his own right, his claim was rejected. Based on the PRSI qualifying conditions alone, he may still be eligible under the Dependent Spouse scheme.

As it is not clear from his original application that these conditions are met, the Department will contact him for further information in order to establish his eligibility for payment.  </P>

        <Quest> the assistance that is available to young persons who turn 18 years of age and who are still in full-time education but who have had the child benefit payment discontinued to them due to recent budget statements; and if he will outline the proposals he will make to assist such young persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Child Benefit assists parents in the cost associated with raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. Between 2000 and 2009, overall expenditure on Child Benefit grew from just &euro;638 million to approximately &euro;2.5 billion per year. However, with tax revenues having fallen dramatically, we cannot afford to maintain spending at this level. </P><Col N="460"/>
        <P>It was decided in Budget 2009 to limit spending on Child Benefit by lowering the upper age limit that currently applies from 19 years to 18 years.  The impact of this measure was phased in, with payment for existing children being halved from January 2009 and payment stopping from the 18th birthday from January 2010.</P>
        <P>Budget 2009 provided for a compensatory payment of &euro;15 to be made to people receiving a social welfare payment which included an increase in respect of an 18 year old child or a Family Income Supplement payment which includes payment in respect of that child.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the need to target limited available resources at persons on low incomes with children in full-time education a number of provisions have been introduced including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The extension of entitlement to Increase for Qualified Child, payable to social welfare recipients in respect of qualifying child dependants, to age 22 where the parent of a full-time student (including third level) is in receipt of either:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />A long-term social welfare payment, or</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />A short-term social welfare payment for six months or more (short-term schemes include such payments as Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and Assistance, Illness Benefit and Supplementary Welfare Allowance), and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The provision of a weekly payment to low paid employees with families, through the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme.  Under this scheme, a qualified child is any child under the age of 18 or aged 18 to 22 in full-time education.  This supplement is paid where a family&rsquo;s weekly  income is below a specified amount for the family size, and is calculated at 60% of the difference between the net family income (i.e. gross pay less tax, PRSI, health contribution, superannuation) and the relevant income limit.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Low income families may also be entitled to a Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance, which is administered by the Health Service Executive and operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 73 of 20 April 2010, the additional moneys and resources that will be put into employment and enabling services, that is, back to education and training schemes <Col N="461"/>and child care provision prior to the proposed cuts to the lone parent scheme due to be made in 2011. </Quest>
        <QRef>[20159/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is conscious that many lone parents will need access to education, training and enabling services such as childcare provision in order to acquire the skills they will need to gain employment.  My Department has been working closely with other Departments and Agencies to ensure that the broader needs of lone parent families are met and that the changes to the One-Parent Family Payment due to be introduced in the forthcoming Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010, will be progressed in that context.  </P>
        <P>My Department provides a wide range of education opportunities for disadvantaged and low-income groups such as lone parents to strengthen their qualifications and skills base and thus maximise their chances of meeting the requirements of the modern labour market and gaining employment.  The Back-to-Education Allowance Scheme currently assists some 3,220 people who are in receipt of the One-Parent Family Payment (out of a total of some 20,800 participants).  Expenditure on the Scheme amounted to &euro;107.3 million in 2009 and a further &euro;169.7 million has been allocated to it for this year.</P>
        <P>With regard to training opportunities, at present, all lone parents who present to F&Aacute;S Employment Services are automatically provided with a one-to-one guidance interview with an Employment Services Officer who either advises them on suitable labour market opportunities such as current work vacancies and suitable training/employment programme places or refers them to other F&Aacute;S supports.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, a new support approach, the Social Inclusion Model, to help people to overcome barriers and to increase their opportunities to access training, employment programmes and, ultimately the labour market, is currently being tested by F&Aacute;S with lone parents.</P>
        <P>The Social Inclusion Model is an inter-agency approach (involving F&Aacute;S, my Department, the Irish Vocational Education Association and lone parent organisations) that includes outreach information and recruitment and a part-time &ldquo;Paving Your Way to Work&rdquo; programme concerned with the provision of information supports regarding welfare to work, budgeting, personal coaching and training education and work options.  It also includes basic IT training.  The programme is aimed at individuals who are parenting alone who want to get a job or improve their job prospects and who need to access a wide range of information and/or learn new skills through training and/or to return to education in order to achieve this.</P>
        <P>An expanded range of opportunities is also available in the area of childcare provision.  The Government has invested some &euro;1 billion throughout the last decade in developing the national childcare infrastructure by creating an additional 65,000 childcare places under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP).  This investment has facilitated the recent introduction of the free Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) year for pre-school children &mdash; which will be particularly helpful to those parenting alone.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) funds a nationwide network of almost 1,000 community childcare facilities to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to disadvantaged and low-income families.  A revised CCSS is being introduced in September 2010, with a supplementary focus on labour activation.  The subvention rates for low-income working parents are being enhanced and the existing level of childcare supports that are specific to lone parents is being maintained.  Lone parents can avail of affordable childcare under the CCSS in the form of full or part-time day-care services and sessional<Col N="462"/>playschool services for younger children.  Equally importantly for lone parents, after-school services and homework clubs are included in the services provided.</P>

        <Quest> his plans to change the time from 12 months to six months waiting for persons who want to avail of the back-to-education allowance in view of the fact that there are 433,000 unemployed; his views on the fact that it is more realistic and for the long-term benefit of young persons to get their benefits through back to education allowance rather that through jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in view of the fact that it would be a transfer of funds from one section to another; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Back to Education allowance (BETA) scheme, the qualifying period for jobseekers is now three months for participation in a second level course.  A twelve month qualifying period applies to third level courses but this is reduced to nine months for those who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process or engaging with the Department&rsquo;s facilitator programme.  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
        <P>Conferring eligibility for access to the BTEA scheme on unemployed people is not simply a matter of a transfer of funds from Jobseeker schemes.  It is a condition of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance that a recipient must be available for employment and genuinely seeking work.  Participants in BTEA are exempted from these requirements.</P>
        <P>The maximum duration of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit is 12 months whereas participation in BTEA is not limited to any specific period.  A student who fulfils the qualifying conditions can avail of BTEA to progress through courses of education from second level to a third level postgraduate course.  In some cases this could extend payment cumulatively to five years or more.    In the case of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, payment can continue while a recipient is unemployed provided their means do not exceed the prescribed limit.  For both Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance and Job<Col N="466"/>seeker&rsquo;s Benefit, any change in the income of a recipient&rsquo;s spouse or partner may affect the rate payable for a qualified adult.  BTEA, however, is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate for the scheme from which the unemployed person transfers.  It is not means-tested and changes in a participant&rsquo;s personal or family financial circumstances do not affect entitlement.  In addition, an annual cost of education allowance of &euro;500 is payable.</P>
        <P>The potential for further changes in certain areas was identified by my predecessor to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  These concerned duration, access to post-graduate courses, appropriateness of courses and progression.  The final shape and scope of such changes are currently under consideration.</P>
        <P>The Back to Education Allowance scheme has an important role to play in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers.  The nature and structure of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding members of the Air Corps who may be considering retirement in 2010, 2011 or generally; their pension entitlements; their lump sum entitlements; the taxation position of both; his plans to change the position in view of his recent announcement; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Retirement benefits in the public service are usually calculated by reference to the rates and scales of pay applicable at the time of retirement.  However, in <i>Budget 2010</i>, the Minister for Finance announced that the pension entitlements of public servants &mdash; including members of the Permanent Defence Force &mdash; retiring in 2010 would not be affected by the cuts in public service pay implemented from 1 January 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The pay cuts were provided for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.  That legislation also provided that the pay cuts shall be disregarded when calculating the retirement benefits (pension and lump sum) of any person leaving the public service during 2010.  This was to prevent a destabilising level of retirements in the public service.  The legislation empowers the Minister to extend by order this arrangement to persons who retire later than 2010.</P>
        <P>Under the <i>Draft Public Service Agreement: 2010-2014</i>, detailed transformation programmes in the form of sectorial agreements have been drawn up for each area, including the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).  Paragraph 1.17 of the draft agreement provides that &ldquo;<i>There will be an extension of the period by a year within which the January 2010 pay reductions will be disregarded for the purposes of calculating public service pension entitlements</i>&rdquo;.  This would extend the period of disregard to the end of 2011.  Its actual implementation is dependent on the agreement being ratified.</P>
        <P>As also announced by the Minister for Finance in <i>Budget 2010</i>, existing public service pensioners were not affected by the pay cuts.  The recent clarification of the Draft Public Service Agreement indicated that, while the Minister for Finance is reviewing the arrangements around indexation of public service pensions and is considering linking public service pensions to increases in the cost of living, &ldquo;<i>no change in the current indexation arrangements for serving public servants and current public service pensioners will be implemented during the period of the agreemen</i>t&rdquo;.</P><Col N="468"/>
        <P>As regards the taxation position, the <i>Commission on Taxation</i> recommended that pension lump sums below &euro;200,000 should not be taxed.  As indicated in the <i>National Pensions Framework</i> published recently, the Government has accepted this recommendation and decided that arrangements for the tax treatment of lump sums above this level would be considered and developed during the implementation of the Framework.  Occupational pensions continue to be subject to income tax in the normal way.</P>

	<P>The Moratorium on Recruitment and Promotions in the Public Service was implemented by the Government on 27 March 2009 until the end of 2010.  It is a matter for Government to decide whether or not to extend the Moratorium beyond 2010.</P>
        <P>Strength returns for the Defence Forces are prepared on a monthly basis.  The strength of the Permanent Defence Force as at 31 March 2009, when the moratorium was introduced, was 10,325 full time personnel, comprising 8,433 Army, 833 Air Corps and 1,059 Naval Service.  The strength of the Reserve Defence Force was 7,513, comprising 7,218 Army and 295 Naval Service.</P>
        <P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force as at 30 April 2010, the latest date for which figures are available, was 9,856, comprising 8,036 Army, 797 Air Corps and 1,023 Naval Service.  The strength of the Reserve Defence Force on the same date was 6,304, comprising 6,035 Army and 269 Naval Service.</P>
        <P>I am acutely aware of the impact of the moratorium on the Permanent Defence Force, particularly in light of the very high turnover rate that is part of any military organisation.  Within the available resources, the Government is committed to maintaining the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at a level of 10,000 all ranks, for which Government approval <Col N="470"/>has been secured in the context of Budget 2010.  This figure reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.</P>
        <P>Targeted recruitment will be carried out in 2010 to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces.  In this regard, advertisements were recently placed for recruitment to the Naval Service and some further recruitment to the Defence Forces is also under consideration in the same context.  In addition, officials from the Department are continuing to engage with the Military Authorities in relation to the review of structures and posts required to meet the operational requirements of the Permanent Defence Force in light of the Government decision to maintain a complement of 10,000 serving personnel.</P>
        <P>Within the Reserve Defence Force, limited recruitment to fill vacancies arising due to existing members resigning, or being discharged in the normal manner, is continuing, subject to the overall strength level that existed at 1 January 2009 (7,671) not being exceeded.  This ongoing limited recruitment is being closely monitored and will be kept under review in the light of the future budgetary provision available to the Department of Defence.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the military authorities that the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government, both at home and overseas.</P>

	<P>While first-time buyers are a particular target group for affordable housing, current legislation provides that previous ownership of a house does not render an applicant ineligible for an affordable home.  It is a matter for the local authority concerned to consider the priority to be given to a person&rsquo;s application for affordable housing having regard to that person&rsquo;s housing need and to the availability of a suitable affordable home.  Detailed eligibility criteria for purchase of an affordable home are determined by each local authority in their priority schemes, and include housing need, income and financial circumstances of applicants.  A local authority must also take account of the ability of a prospective affordable purchaser to repay the relevant mortgage or local authority home loan.</P>

	<P>The primary role of my Department in electoral matters is to provide an appropriate policy and legislative framework for a modern and efficient electoral system.  Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referenda, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station and count staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law.  Section 31 of the Electoral Act 1992 sets out the general duty of returning officers including ascertaining and declaring the results of an election while section 95 of the Act contains the legislative provisions relating to the appointment of presiding officers and poll clerks.  Returning officers are independent in the performance of their duties.</P>
        <P>To assist returning officers, my Department issues guidance to them in advance of each election and referendum. The guidance emphasises that the smooth conduct of polls is dependant on maintaining a cadre of sufficiently skilled and experienced people. Having regard to that overall objective, returning officers are advised to employ competent and efficient persons as polling staff and asked to give consideration, where possible, to employing suitable persons who are unemployed. In addition, my Department issues guidance to presiding officers in advance of each election and referendum outlining the duties and functions presiding officers are expected to perform on polling day in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Drinking cans, disposable bottles and plastic bottles are covered by the scope of Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste (the Packaging Directive).  This Directive is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market.</P>
        <P>Under the Directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005.  Directive 2004/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, amending the Packaging Directive, introduces a new increased packaging waste recovery target of 60% (with 55% by way of recycling).</P>
        <P>The National Waste Report 2008 states that packaging waste recovery increased to 65% in that year, indicating that Ireland has met and exceeded the target recovery rate of 60% set by the Packaging Directive for 2011.</P>
        <P>At present, the arrangements for recovering packaging waste from consumers and householders consist principally of segregated collections for dry recyclables and an extensive network of bring banks and civic amenity sites.  Practical implementation of the Directive in Ireland is organised mainly through a collective industry-based compliance scheme operated by Repak Limited, which is operating successfully.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that despite progress on recycling we need to continue to improve our performance.  The 2007 Programme for Government contained a commitment to carry out an <Col N="476"/>international review of waste management plans, practices and procedures and act on its conclusions, and in November 2009 consultants delivered a major international report on waste management policy. I am utilising the report&rsquo;s recommendations, with a key focus on waste prevention, reuse and recycling, in developing a new policy statement on waste management, which I will bring to Government and publish for public consultation shortly.</P>

	<P>Development which is not carried out in compliance with the terms of the planning permission for the development is unauthorised development which is an offence under the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The Act provides that enforcement action may not be taken in respect of a development for which permission has been granted after seven years beginning on the expiration of the duration of the permission.  I am considering what further amendments of these provisions may be required, in relation to quarrying, in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009.  The Planning and Development Act also provides that proceedings may be commenced at any time in respect of any condition concerning the use of land to which the permission is subject.</P>

	<P>I notified County Councils of their block grant allocations under the Rural Water Programme last month, and &euro;0.820 million was allocated to Westmeath County Council.  These block grant allocations cover both funding for group water schemes and small public water and sewerage schemes.  The major part of the funding for the group water sector is directed at investment required under the Rural Water Action Plan developed in response to an adverse ruling against Ireland by the European Court of Justice.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the administration of the Rural Water Programme has been devolved to local authorities since 1997. The selection and approval of individual group water schemes for advancement under the programme, within the overall priorities set by my Department and subject to the block grant funding provided, is therefore a matter for the local authorities.  I have no proposals at present to increase these block grant allocations. However, the position will be kept under review during the course of the year.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The national Building Regulations, which are operative since 1992, set out the legal requirements for the construction of new buildings and the extension of, material alteration to, and certain changes of, use of existing buildings. The comprehensive set of related Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) provide detailed information on how to comply with the Regulations. The Regulations are subject to review and improvement in the light of ongoing technical progress and developments within the construction industry,  in consultation with the Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB).  BRAB  was established under the Building Control Act  1990 to advise me on matters relating to building regulations.</P>
        <P>Part A of the Building Regulations sets out the legal requirements for the structural performance of buildings. It covers issues such as loadings on buildings, ground movements and disproportionate collapse. TGD-A provides guidance on how to comply with Part A and calls up structural design standards, for example the Eurocodes (which includes EN 1990).  Designs carried out to these Standards and their accompanying National Annexes will, prima facie, indicate compliance with Part A.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A Fire Safety Certificate (FSC) is currently required before construction work commences on new non-domestic buildings and apartment blocks and extensions to or material alterations/changes of use of existing buildings.  The FSC is issued by the Building Control Authority and certifies that the building, if constructed in accordance with the plans and documentation submitted, will comply with the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations.</P>
        <P>Section 5 of the 2007 Act contains a new provision for the submission of a 7 Day Notice to a Building Control Authority, before grant of the relevant Fire Safety Certificate (FSC), where a person intends to commence work on the construction of a building, or an extension of, or a material alteration to, a building. It must be accompanied by a valid application for an FSC and by a Statutory Declaration stating that the application for the relevant FSC has been completed in all respects and complies with the requirements of the Building Regulations; that <Col N="478"/>any works commenced before the FSC is granted will comply with the Regulations; and that the person will carry out any modifications which may be required by the FSC, when granted, within such period as may be specified by the Building Control Authority.</P>
        <P>There is also a new provision for a Revised Fire Safety Certificate where an application for an FSC is made before the grant of planning permission, for any works required by the permission ultimately granted, or where significant revision has been made to the design or works of a building for which an FSC has been granted.</P>
        <P>In addition, there is provision for a Regularisation Certificate where a building has been commenced or completed without an application for an FSC, where such Certificate is required.  An application for a Regularisation Certificate must include a Statutory Declaration from the applicant that the works carried out are in compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations. The Building Control Authority may issue the Certificate having considered the application and carried out an inspection of the building. The Authority is empowered to specify that the Regularisation Certificate will not have effect unless any conditions/additional works required by the Authority are carried out within a period of 4 months after it is granted.</P>
        <P>Section 5 of the Act also provides for a prohibition on the opening, occupation or use of a building which has not been granted the necessary certificates by the Building Control Authority, as required, including the certificates referred to above.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations is a matter for the owner or builder of a building. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is the responsibility of individual Building Control Authorities which are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, where considered necessary.  The careful selection of competent building professionals and contractors should help to ensure that buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the Regulations. Where the construction of a building is the subject of a contract between the client and the builder compliance is also a contractual obligation.</P>
        <P>Compliance with the Building Regulations is kept under constant review by my Department. I understand that BRAB has completed a report on enforcement of the regulations and that this report is to be submitted to me shortly.  I expect this to be an important input to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing consideration of the building regulations regime.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 448, 451 and 454 together.  </P>
        <P>A comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure has been approved for County Limerick in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2010 -2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The total value of contracts underway and those proposed for commencement during the period of the Programme in County Limerick is &euro;23.186 million.  The Programme provides for the commencement of contracts relating to the Askeaton and Kilmallock Sewerage Schemes whereas the Adare Sewerage Scheme is not included in the new Programme.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently examining Limerick County Council&rsquo;s Design Build Operate contract documents for the wastewater treatment plant for the Kilmallock Sewerage scheme and a decision will be conveyed to the Council as soon as possible.  The Department is also examining a Preliminary Report for a bundle of five sewerage schemes, including Askeaton.   The other schemes included in the bundle, the Athea, Foynes, Glin and Shanagolden Sewerage Schemes, are not included among the contracts and schemes in County Limerick to be progressed under the new Programme. A decision on the Preliminary Report will be conveyed to the Council as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The new Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth as envisaged in the Government&rsquo;s policy document Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy &mdash; A Framework for Sustainable Economic Revival.</P>
        <P>A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Limerick County Council, in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time.</P>

	<P>Houses sold to first time buyers under the various affordable housing schemes at a significant discount from market value contain a clawback provision, in order to prevent short-term profit taking on the resale of the house to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes.  There are no plans to abolish the clawback arrangements under the existing affordable housing schemes.</P>
        <P>However, where a person is selling an affordable home and the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount of the clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>In December 2009, the Government re-affirmed its commitment to the regeneration programme for Limerick and endorsed the programme&rsquo;s overall vision for a ten-year transformation of the Limerick Regeneration areas.  The Government also requested that the Limerick Regeneration Agencies prepare a detailed plan for the first phase of the implementation process. A proposed Phase One Implementation Plan was completed and adopted by the Agencies&rsquo; Boards in April.  This has since been provided to my Department, and will be submitted to Government shortly.</P>
        <P>The Phase 1 plan provides a road map for, in particular, the physical, as well as the social and economic, regeneration of these communities for the period to December 2014, with a total estimated cost of public projects amounting to some &euro;337 million.  It proposes strategic <Col N="481"/>infrastructure projects of benefit to the wider Limerick region, and other key community facilities for the regeneration areas.  The Plan identifies a range of new housing projects for each of the areas, as well as refurbishment and infill projects to retain certain areas of existing good quality housing. The plan also notes the importance of delivering mixed tenure housing, and the clustering of projects in the various phases to deliver new communities, within the wider strategic planning context.</P>
        <P>In terms of enterprise development, the plan identifies an opportunity for the regeneration to act as a catalyst for economic development in the region.  It specifically proposes a focus on developing &ldquo;green industries&rdquo; in the areas. The Agencies have identified a range of funding and investment considerations and the Inter-Departmental Group, established to review options for the incentivisation of the essential private investment required to underpin the overall success of the regeneration programme, will work to advance a package of measures to deliver such investment.</P>
        <P>With investment of over &euro;50 million in Limerick regeneration to date, I am providing a further &euro;25 million from my Department&rsquo;s 2010 Vote for a programme of enabling works, including relocation, acquisitions, demolition and site clearances, community stabilisation, and social inclusion activities. Work is progressing on the detailed planning and design of two &ldquo;new build&rdquo; housing projects which will provide up to 100 new homes, primarily for older people living in the Moyross and Ballinacurra Weston areas, with a view to advancing these projects to tender in 2010.  Design work is also underway on two similar projects for Southill and St. Mary&rsquo;s Park.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s funding is supplemented by significant additional investment from other Departments and State Agencies, in terms of both Garda resources and other State interventions in the areas of education, youth, sport, health, training, childcare and community facilities. This whole of Government approach, essential for delivery of successful regeneration, will continue to be at the centre of our work on the implementation plan for the Limerick regeneration programme.</P>

Farmers will also have the alternative option of applying for the Agri-Environment Options Scheme implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which has significantly more funding resources available to it than are available to my Department&rsquo;s scheme.</P>
        <P>There will be no removal or relaxation of necessary restrictions arising from the designation of lands as Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protected Areas or Natural Heritage Areas.</P>

	<P>The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, published in June 2009,  provides an amendment to section 42 of the Planning and Development Acts, which currently provides that the duration of a planning permission must be extended, subject to certain conditions, where substantial works have been carried out before the expiration of the original permission.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment provides for the extension of permission (for a period of up to 5 years) in circumstances where substantial works have not been carried out, but there are commercial, economic or technical considerations, beyond the control of the applicant, which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works.</P>

	<P Just="Left">With effect from 24 March 2009 until the end of 2010, no public service post, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion, nor payment of an allowance for the performance of <Col N="484"/>duties at a higher grade. This general moratorium also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed-term basis and to the renewal of such contracts.</P>
        <P>My Department received a delegated sanction from the Department of Finance in August 2009 for implementation of this general moratorium on the filling of public sector posts across all local authorities. This is on condition that the overall staffing levels in the sector are reduced significantly by the end of 2010 in adherence with the Government&rsquo;s Policy on Staffing and Numbers in the Public Sector.</P>
        <P>Local Authorities are expected, where vacancies arise, to consider options for reorganisation and reallocation of work to meet requirements. Staffing sanctions are granted by my Department in exceptional circumstances including where posts are of a statutory nature or for posts associated with front line service delivery.</P>
        <P>In this context, in dealing with overall management of organisation and personnel, local authorities are expected to give priority to assuring compliance with statutory obligations and the delivery of front line services.</P>
        <P>Requests for staffing sanction of specific posts for work placement and training programmes operated by the Minister for Social Protection, received from South Dublin County Council and other local authorities, will be assessed on an individual basis by my Department.</P>

        <Quest> his plans to rectify an anomaly arising under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in relation to one off housing, whereby the owner is restricted for seven years regarding those to whom the property can be sold, whereas, if the owner defaults as a result of job loss and so on the financial institution which repossesses the house is unrestricted and may profit at the owner&rsquo;s expense; if he will consider a relaxation of this rule on a case by case basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 39 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that a condition may be attached to a grant of planning permission for a house, specifying that the house must be occupied by persons of a particular class or description, with provision to that effect to be incorporated in an agreement under section 47 of the Act. </P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s 2005 Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing state that such conditions are only appropriate in order to control development in rural areas close to cities and towns which are under considerable pressure for development and in areas which are under pressure for holiday home or second home development.  The Guidelines recommend that applicants demonstrate roots or links to such areas within the local need criteria set out in the development plan in order to facilitate a positive approach to applications from such persons in areas where an application might have to be ordinarily refused.</P>
        <P>The Guidelines recommend a seven-year occupancy condition period for a dwelling.  Nonetheless, within this period, it is open to the dwelling owner, with the consent of the planning authority, to sell the house to another person who would satisfy the local need criteria for the area.</P>
        <P>The Guidelines further recommend that lending institutions should not be bound by occupancy conditions if they foreclose on a mortgage and wish to sell the property.  As it would be questionable whether a lending institution would advance funding if in any way restricted in the event of foreclosure, exempting lending institutions from occupancy conditions is intended <Col N="485"/>not to put obstacles in the way of persons who wish to source funding to build a house because of a separate legal agreement they may have with the planning authority.</P>
        <P>While the enforcement of such planning conditions is a matter for each planning authority, having regard to national policy, I understand that planning authorities consider requests for non-enforcement of occupancy conditions on a case-by-case basis from dwelling owners who are in compelling situations for the sale of their dwelling.</P>

	<P>Under the 1999 affordable housing scheme houses are acquired by a local authority by means of borrowing through the Housing Finance Agency (HFA). In the five year period 2005 to 2009 &euro;1,507,000 was drawn down by Waterford City Council from the HFA in respect of the provision of affordable housing.</P>
        <P>Exchequer funding in respect of the affordable housing scheme is confined to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the payment of mortgage subsidy to local authorities to reduce the monthly outgoings of purchasers with household income below &euro;28,000 in the previous tax year; and,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the payment of a site subsidy to local authorities which enables them to provide housing under the 1999 scheme at an affordable price and at a discount from the market value of similar houses in their areas.  Site subsidy is demand led and depends particularly on the price paid by a local authority for land and on those authorities applying for subsidy in the first place. In the years 2005-2009 no site subsidy was paid to Waterford City Council.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">The table sets out the amount of mortgage subsidy paid to Waterford City Council from 2005 to 2009.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 467 to 469, inclusive, together</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grant schemes, introduced in November 2007, are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  The new suite of grants replaced the discontinued Disabled Persons Grant Scheme, the Essential Repairs Grant Scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme, administered by the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed to each of the various grant measures from within the allocations notified to them by my <Col N="489"/>Department and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within their allocation.</P>
        <P>Details of the annual Exchequer allocations to Waterford City Council and the number of grants paid under each scheme for the period 2005 to 2009 are set out in the table below. Data for 2005 and 2006 relate to the discontinued Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes.  Data for 2007 onwards include the new Housing Adaptation Grant Scheme for People with a Disability, the Housing Aid for Older People and the Mobility Aids Grant Schemes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 474 and 475 together.</P>
        <P>The Government created a salmon hardship fund for those affected by the cessation of mixed stock fishing in 2006.  The Salmon Hardship Scheme, which was administered by BIM, provided a measure of relief to individuals in line with the level of hardship likely to be experienced.  The scheme, participation in which was voluntary, is closed since the end of April 2007.  The Department is not the issuing authority for licences and does not have the details sought by the Deputy of those who did not participate in the scheme.</P>
        <P>The harvest of salmon by any means is permitted only in those rivers that are meeting their conservation limits and have an identified surplus following appropriate assessment.  The <Col N="490"/>Standing Scientific Committee has advised that stocks of salmon in the River Shannon are below conservation limits.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to relax the conservation measures other than where river stocks recover and it is established from the results of the scientific analysis that significant numbers of fish destined for other rivers are not intercepted.  It should be possible, in those circumstances, to exploit the identified surplus in rivers, bays and estuaries, within the constraints permitted by the Habitats Directive.</P>
        <P>Those salmon licence holders who did not avail of the Salmon Hardship Scheme will be able to apply for a licence to fish in the future, while those who did receive a payment under the scheme gave an undertaking not to apply for a licence in the future.</P>

	<P>The Greener Homes Scheme supports the installation by householders of renewable energy heating technologies including wood-pellet and chip stoves and boilers, gasification boilers, solar panels and geothermal heat pumps.  The grant is a fixed amount, based upon the particular technology selected, towards the cost of purchase and installation of the chosen scheme.  Products and installers must be selected from published Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) registered lists.  The net number of applications from 2006 to date under the Scheme is 29,000.  Nearly 25,000 installations have been completed under the Scheme.  Exchequer funding to date has amounted to just under &euro;62m.</P>
        <P>The Greener Homes Scheme has created a stable market in domestic renewable energy technologies and has supported the development of the renewable heating industry.</P>
        <P>The current phase of the scheme was launched in July 2008.  New homes ceased to be eligible with the introduction of the new building regulations under which it is now compulsory to include a component of renewable energy in new housing developments.</P>
        <P>The scheme is supporting a range of objectives, including more competitive offerings for the consumer, enhanced product standards, quality assurance and improved training standards and certainty for the renewable heating industry.</P>
        <P>The third phase of the Greener Homes Scheme is limited to existing houses defined as residences that are over one year.  This was introduced to align the scheme with the mandatory changes to Part L of the Building Regulations in 2008.</P>

	<P>My priority, in accordance with national policy, is to provide for the closure, in 2012, of the analogue &ldquo;free-to-view&rdquo; broadcasting service.</P><Col N="491"/>
        <P>In this regard I have recently signed an Order, Statutory Instrument 85 of 2010, under section 129 of the Broadcasting Act, 2009.  This Order requires RT&Eacute; to launch a &ldquo;free-to-view&rdquo; DTT service to approximately 90% of the population by 31st October 2010.</P>
        <P>The 2009 Act also requires RT&Eacute; to provide the full national &ldquo;free-to-view&rdquo; digital service, capable of carrying RT&Eacute; 1, RT&Eacute; 2, TG4 and TV3, by the end of 2011 or such date as I may specify.  In this regard I have informed RT&Eacute; that the date for the provision of a national service is 31st December 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The exact areas to be covered in each county, is dependent on a number of factors including transmitter location, signal strength and topography.  I have however, been informed by RT&Eacute; that the list of sites shown in appendix I, are the transmitter sites that will provide coverage on 31st October 2010 and that construction of two sites remain to be completed.  This will be dependent on weather conditions.</P>
        <P>RT&Eacute; and RT&Eacute;NL have informed me that they have comprehensive communications plans in preparation for the autumn and these will be published in due course. The information communications plan for DTT will be timely and appropriate, and will be made available to the Irish public through a variety of methods.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 478 and 483 together.</P>
        <P>The European Commission published a Commission Decision dated the 15th February 2007 entitled &ldquo;Reserving the national numbering range beginning with &ldquo;116&rdquo; for harmonised numbers for harmonised services of social value&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The allocation of specific numbers in the 116 number range in Ireland is managed by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which published (July 2007) and advertised (November 2007) the existence of the number range and invited suitable applicants to apply for the setting up of services.</P>
        <P>I am advised by ComReg that Childline commenced a service using the telephone number 116111 in April 2009 and that the number 116123 has been allocated to the Samaritans.</P>
        <P>It is open to other organisations to apply to ComReg for the allocation of additional numbers from this numbering range.  I am informed by ComReg that no organisation has yet applied for the missing children hotline number 116000.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 479 to 481, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Government has set the targets for the contribution from renewable energy sources to electricity at 40% by 2020.  The 40% electricity target is consistent with the new EU target <Col N="493"/>addressed to Ireland in the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC, which requires Ireland to increase the contribution from renewable sources to 16% of all energy consumed (encompassing electricity, transport and heating) by 2020.</P>
        <P>Reflecting the need to support the development of biomass, I announced in February 2008 a Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) for biomass of 12 cent per kilowatt hour.</P>
        <P>I have received representations on behalf of stakeholders in relation to the REFIT price for biomass.  Under the auspices of the Renewable Energy Development Group, which is chaired by my Department, the Bioenergy Working Group is currently finalising a Bioenergy Road Map to 2020, which will underpin the contribution of bioenergy, including biomass to Ireland&rsquo;s Renewable Energy target for 2020.  The Working Group is reviewing the current REFIT for the various categories of biomass Combined Heat and Power plants, having regard to the particular challenges for the sector and I expect that work to be finalised within the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>The provisional Energy Balance for 2009 indicates that biomass provided 165 ktoe to final energy consumption in 2009.  This includes the panel board mills, sawmills, and end users in the domestic and commercial sectors.</P>
        <P>Under the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) ReHeat Deployment Programme, 164 biomass boilers have been supported, with a total installed capacity of 72 MW, or an average size of about 400 kW per boiler.  Based on an average annual operation of 3500 hours these boilers provide about 22 ktoe of final energy.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Framework 2007 sets out a target for co-firing in peat stations of 30% by 2015.  Both ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na have been conducting a programme of research and development, including large scale co-firing trials with a variety of materials.  The trials have also encompassed laboratory tests on the chemical and physical properties of various materials.</P>
        <P>Decisions by ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na on what material to co-fire and the timing of the move to introduce large scale co-firing will be taken in light of the ongoing trials.</P>
        <P>Both companies have been in discussions with a number of market players around sourcing potential supplies for the co-firing material.  The companies themselves will be responsible for making the commercial decisions to award any such contracts.</P>
        <P>The objective is to utilise domestically produced biomass as much as possible, and my Department is working closely with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to ensure that its support schemes for energy crops and forestry are in alignment with the scale of demand that may ultimately arise as a result of the co-firing process.</P>
        <P>The Miscanthus Pilot Demonstration Programme is a newly launched programme funded under the Renewable Energy Research Development and Demonstration Programme, which provides assistance for the deployment of renewable heating systems fuelled by miscanthus in commercial, industrial, services and public sectors and also community organisations and Energy Supply Companies (ESCOs), in Ireland.  The programme, which was launched on 30th April 2010, is administered by SEAI.</P>
        <P>The use of miscanthus as a fuel to date is very limited in Ireland, due to a number of issues including limited experience with its use as a boiler fuel.  The Miscanthus Pilot Demonstration Programme is intended to support the establishment of a number of exemplar boiler sites, between five and 15 depending on the mix of size ranges and costs submitted.  These exemplar sites will serve to provide important information on the supply chain logistics and suitability of miscanthus as a boiler fuel in an Irish context, as well as providing a solid basis for creating market confidence.</P>

	<P>My Department entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) in late December 2008.  Since then, 3 has progressed its network rollout and NBS broadband services are now available in more than 60% of the 1,028 designated Electoral Divisions (ED) to be covered under the Scheme.</P>
        <P>The general area of Magheraroarty/Gortahork, County Donegal, will be covered by the NBS.  While it is not possible to predict at this stage when precisely broadband services under this Scheme will become available in this area, under the NBS contract, all EDs in the NBS Coverage Area are required to have broadband connectivity by the end of September 2010.  The current status of each area to be covered by the NBS is available at www.three.ie/nbs.</P>

        <P FLI="0">EU rules stipulate that food products of animal origin traded from an EU source must be from approved food business establishments and be accompanied to destination by a commercial document or a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the Member State of origin.  Imports from Third countries must be sourced from countries the EU regards as operating controls on production and processing that give equivalent guarantees to those in the EU. Such imports must be accompanied by the appropriate EU model health certification provided by the competent authorities of the country of origin. Following prior notification to the Border Inspection Post (BIP) of import, all consignments must be presented for veterinary examination which will include documentary, identity and physical <Col N="495"/>checks in accordance with EU requirements. The EU Food &amp; Veterinary Office (FVO) monitors and inspects each Member State&rsquo;s controls on Food Safety including the operation of BIPs to ensure the conditions for import and placing of animal products on to the market, as provided under the harmonized legislation, are being correctly applied.</P>
        <P>Any imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination.  Where non-compliance is established they may be returned to the exporting country or destroyed at the importers cost.</P>

        <P>Category B of the 2005 National Reserve catered for farmers, who made an investment between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 &mdash; 2002.  Investments included the purchase or long-term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments such as buildings.</P>
        <P>The application was in respect of the purchase of land and other investments.  The person named did not submit sufficient information to enable the processing of his application despite a number of requests for the required information.  His application was therefore rejected and he was notified of this decision on 20 April 2006.</P>

	<P>The person named has 15 animals for consideration under the 2009 Suckler Welfare Scheme. One of the conditions of the Scheme, as is set out in the Terms and Conditions, is that the calves must be introduced to concentrate (meal) feeding a minimum of 4 weeks before weaning. According to the information supplied to my Department by the applicant none of the animals were fed meal for the required four weeks before weaning. Consequently, as the required condition was not adhered to, no payment can issue. A letter has issued to the applicant advising her of the Department&rsquo;s decision on her application.</P>

	<P>It is clear from on-going liaison between officials of my Department and representatives of relevant stakeholders including Local Authorities, Animal Welfare Organisations and the Horse Industry that horse welfare problems continue to be reported including a risk of abandonment of horses.</P>
        <P>My Department provides annual funding in the region of &euro;2m to Local Authorities to assist in their work in implementing the Control of Horses Act.  Through the auspices of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council, my officials are continuing to work with the ISPCA in an effort to intervene in potential horse welfare situations before they become critical.  Mindful of the valuable work being done by the welfare organisations and as a contribution towards the cost of their activities, I provided funding of &euro;1.185 million in December 2009 towards their work in 2010.  Some &euro;100,000 was provided to Dublin SPCA to assist its work in 2010 including the valuable work it undertakes at the horse fair referred to by the Deputy.  In providing funding to welfare bodies I also urged those welfare organisations that have the capacity to deal with larger animals to consider placing greater resources in promoting horse welfare.</P>
        <P>As regards reducing the supply of horses at the horse fair referred to by the Deputy, this is an issue that is outside of my control.  The problems associated with the holding of this fair are only partly related to animal welfare, with public safety issues also featuring.  I have no legislative power in this matter.</P>

	<P>Before REPS was closed to new applications in July 2009, 31,264 applications had been received including some 1,800 which are eligible to begin their contracts this year.  The acceptance of REPS 4 applications is governed by EU Regulations which require exhaustive administrative checks and on-the-spot inspections.  In a significant number of the applications received, the administrative checks raised issues and queries which required further detailed examination. My Department&rsquo;s <Col N="498"/>staff have been working to resolve these as quickly as possible. Many of these cases required the applicants&rsquo; planners to amend the farm plans that were submitted originally.  The applicants concerned were made aware of the position and the applications are being further processed without delay on receipt of amended plans.  So far, 23,640 applicants have received full payment for 2009 and work is continuing to process the remainder as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>My officials have also been in contact with the 119 applicants whose plans had been rejected, to inform them of their right to appeal the decision. Alternatively, unless the application had been found to be fundamentally ineligible, applicants were given the opportunity to submit a new REPS 4 plan and application form on or before 17 May 2010.  The latter cases will be dealt with as a priority.</P>

	<P>The person named joined REPS 1 on 1 January 1997 and received three years payment. He did not lodge an application for payment for his fourth year.  Under the terms and conditions of REPS 1, this led to the termination of his contract and the recoupment of all the payments he had received.</P>
        <P>My officials have been in contact with the person named and have considered documentation which he submitted relating to his health.  However as the health issues he put forward had already existed when he joined the scheme, my officials concluded that there were no grounds <Col N="499"/>to allow him to terminate his contract without recoupment.  His Single Payment Scheme applications in respect of each year were processed for full payment, but payments were held against the REPS debt.</P>
        <P>It is open to the person named to seek a further review of his case.  If he wishes to do so, he should communicate directly with my Department&rsquo;s REPS Debt Recovery Section at Johnstown Castle Estate, Co Wexford.</P>

        <P>Discussions are ongoing with the relevant farming organizations in regard to the terms and conditions of the Schemes concerned.   These should be completed in the near future and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement regarding the new Schemes at that stage.  A sum of &euro;1 million has been made available in the 2010 Estimates for the new targeted on-farm investment schemes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 500 and 535 together.</P><Col N="501"/>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department&rsquo;s website. Where there is no psychologist available through NEPS, a school may access psychological assessments through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Under the SCPA, such schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that in common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.</P>
        <P>Your question does not state which school the child, concerned in this question, currently attends so I am unable to advise on whether the school is covered directly by NEPS. However it is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process described above. I would suggest that the parents of the child in question should discuss the matter with the school Principal who will advise them as to the appropriateness of a referral in this instance and the process for accessing same.  Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing I would suggest that they should contact the relevant local NEPS Regional Director, for whom contact details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>I wish to confirm for the Deputy that the qualifying criteria for pupil enrolment in specific learning disability (SLD) special classes has not changed. The enrolment of a child in such classes is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of the school concerned. Schools are required to observe Department policy in enrolling children in these classes. This includes having a professional assessment confirming that the child&rsquo;s attainment levels meets the Department&rsquo;s criteria and a recommendation for special class placement. Schools are eligible for resources for SLD classes when the pupils enrolled meet the Depart<Col N="505"/>ment&rsquo;s criteria. These classes operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio and pupils attending the classes attract a special increased rate of capitation grant. Schools are also required to liaise with the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) in the context of any proposed placements in such classes.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is aware that a key focus and priority of my Department is to provide for resources in schools to support pupils with special educational needs, including those with a SLD. I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department implemented a General Allocation System of learning support/resource teachers to mainstream primary schools in September 2005. This model ensures that mainstream primary schools have the additional teaching resources already in place to enable them cater for children with high-incidence special educational needs, including pupils with SLD. A comprehensive circular, SP ED 02/05, was issued to schools to provide guidelines and advice on the manner in which they should use the resources that have been allocated to them to best effect.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through the local SENOs, is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs support. The NCSE operates within the Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. The responsibility also includes identifying appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The general allocation model was introduced in primary schools in September 2005 to ensure that each school has learning support/resource teaching support available to meet the needs of children with high incidence special educational needs. The allocation system under the general allocation model was linked to the school&rsquo;s enrolment in 2005 and it was decided not to review this aspect until the model had been in operation for three years. The allocation to schools is however enhanced in the case of schools experiencing large increases in enrolment and which satisfy the conditions under my Department&rsquo;s Developing School Criteria. The review of the General Allocation is at an advanced stage and is being considered within my Department. Schools decide themselves how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils and how to adjust their support in line with the changing needs of pupils as they mature. The Department provided a circular SP ED 02/05 to schools to assist them in deploying the General Allocation Model resources.</P><Col N="506"/>
        <P>You will be aware that the Department&rsquo;s policy is to support the inclusive education of students with special educational needs across the schools system. In this context, a range of supports are provided to schools to enable them to cater for pupils with special educational needs. The supports available include additional teaching support, special needs assistant support, school transport and grants for the purchase of teaching materials and specialised equipment.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 514 and 513 together.</P>
        <P>Public service pay is a huge element of public expenditure and the total bill is determined by the number of public servants and the pay rates payable to them. The moratorium which was introduced in March 2009  is a key control measure aimed at reducing the number of public servants. The duration of the moratorium will be a matter for Government to decide in the context of budgetary savings to be achieved. In contrast to what is happening in other areas of the public service, the Government has already tapered application of the moratorium to schools by providing for a growth in teacher numbers and allowing from the outset the automatic filling of principal and deputy principal posts of responsibility.</P>
        <P>The public sector numbers for 31 March 2009 for primary teachers was 31,134 and for post-primary teachers was 28,262. The public sector numbers for 31 March 2010 for primary teachers <Col N="508"/>was 31,860 and for post-primary teachers was 27,860. The introduction in September 2009 of the part-time payroll for primary teachers facilitated the inclusion of those part-time teachers in public sector numbers from that date onwards.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 515 and 516 together.</P>
        <P>The total number of whole time equivalent staff employed in third level institutions at 31 December, 2008 was 21,149. It is estimated that at 31 March, 2010 the number employed was 20084 whole time equivalents. Disaggregated data on the number of lecturers that are included in these figures are not available in my Department. However the information has been sought and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available. The purpose of the Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector is to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the public sector and is intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer. In applying this moratorium generally, teaching and research activities in the education sector have been afforded significant exemptions relative to other areas of public expenditure. Nonetheless, the Deputy will appreciate that the sector has to contribute towards overall public sector numbers reductions.</P>
        <P>In the area of higher education, the Government agreed that an employment control framework be developed to provide for the application of the moratorium arrangements to higher education institutions, subject to the continued oversight and review by the HEA and both my Department and the Department of Finance. The Government is anxious to work with the publicly funded higher education institutions in achieving necessary reductions in public expenditure within the sector as an essential part of overall budgetary strategy. The employment control framework aims to enable this while providing a greater flexibility around recruitment in the filling of posts, on the basis of achieving a minimum 6% reduction in the number of overall core staff by end of 2010 as compared with the numbers in place at 31 December 2008. It is a matter for the individual higher education institutions to manage their staffing resources in the context of implementing the framework.</P>

	<P>Officials in my Department have had a series of meetings with the Trustees of the school to which the Deputy refers. The Trustees expressed some concern about the future of the school and it is my understanding that they are considering a number of options in this regard. The Department understands that the Trustees have met with the Board of Management, staff and representatives of parents from the school to inform them of their concerns on its viability. When the Trustees have formally notified the Department of their intentions in relation to the future of the school, the matter will be considered further.</P>

	<P>All schools with permanent recognition from my Department and in non-rented accommodation were eligible to apply to my Department for funding under the Summer Works Scheme for 2010. In my announcement of 19 April last, 1490 successful applicants under the scheme were announced. This included 19 fee-charging schools. This represents less than 1.3% of the total number of successful applicants. The Circular governing the operation of the scheme sets out in order of priority the nature of the works which are eligible for grant assistance under the scheme in order to ensure that works of most urgent need receive priority in the awarding of funding under the scheme.  </P>

Some 2,300 applications, in total, were received under the Scheme. I announced details of the 1,490 successful applicants under the mainstream Summer Works Scheme on 19 April last. It is intended that the applications for water conservation measures aspect of the Scheme will be processed separately and I hope to announce details of the successful applicants for those measures later this year.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Financial assistance is available to students under the maintenance grant schemes, which are administered by the local authorities and Vocational Education Committees on behalf of my Department. Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. Under the terms of the Higher Education Grant Scheme a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously. However, financial assistance is available to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course, at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained. The progression route at postgraduate level, for grant purposes, is as follows: Higher Diploma/Postgraduate Diploma/Masters/PhD/Doctorate. Candidates who hold a diploma qualification and are pursuing a second diploma qualification cannot be considered for funding.</P>

A final breakdown of the outcome of the review will be made available when all schools have been reviewed.</P>
        <P>I wish to confirm for the Deputy that my Department is very supportive of the SNA scheme. It has been a key factor in both ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes. The SNA scheme will continue to be supported and the NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and resources will continue to be allocated to schools to meet children&rsquo;s needs in line with my Department&rsquo;s policy.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the review of policies and procedures for the provision of temporary classroom accommodation is well underway.</P>
        <P>The review incorporates the development of standard specifications for temporary accommodation, the development of new contractual terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation options to cater for individual local circumstances and appropriately protect the interests of the Department and school authorities.  Another strand of the review is negotiations with prefab suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts or reductions in annual rent, as appropriate. An initial group of 46 schools with rented prefabricated accommodation has been identified for priority negotiations with suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts.</P>
        <P>The focus of this review is the development and adoption of practical measures and policies to achieve best value for money in the area of temporary accommodation in schools.  The selection criteria for buy-out options have identified schools where lengthy rental contracts exist.  However value for money is not achieved with this approach alone.  Schools have been identified for buy-out of prefabs where newer rental contracts exist in circumstances where the least value for money is evident.  Negotiations are on-going with a number of prefab suppliers and as soon as these negotiations are completed additional rental contracts will be bought out during 2010.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has issued child protection guidelines and procedures to all schools. The guidelines are based on Children First &mdash; the Department of Health &amp; Children&rsquo;s national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children.  The Children First guidelines make very clear the reporting and <Col N="514"/>investigation mechanisms to be followed in cases of suspected child abuse wherever they occur, and the lead role of the HSE. </P>
        <P>The guidelines for schools require each board of management to designate a senior member of staff, normally the principal, as the Designated Liaison Person (DLP) for the school.  The DLP acts as a liaison person with the health authorities and other agencies on child protection issues and as a resource person to any staff member who has concerns in this regard.</P>
        <P>In anticipation of the review and recent updating of Children First, my Department wrote to all the education partners last Autumn inviting submissions from them on potential changes that might be desirable to the Department&rsquo;s existing child protection guidelines to schools.  The education partners were also invited to participate in a working party to review the guidelines and the working party commenced its work last December. A series of meetings with the partners have since taken place and good progress has been made.</P>
        <P>In February 2007, the Department issued revised internal guidelines and procedures which have been circulated to all persons employed by the Department. The guidelines were based on Children First.  The purpose of these procedures is to provide direction and guidance to staff in dealing with any allegations or complaints of abuse which are made to the Department.  These guidelines will also be updated later this year, taking account of both the revised Children First and the child protection guidelines for schools.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  533 and 534 together. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network and a school placement is available for the child in question.</P>
        <P>Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.</P>
        <P>My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) and Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  The SESS facilitates a partnership approach involving support teams of practising teachers, Education Centres, the Inspectorate, the National Educational Psychological Service, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the National Council for Special Education, Third Level Colleges, Health Board Personnel, Teacher Unions and other relevant bodies and services.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENO) for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support students with autism.  The SENO will also consider applications from schools to establish special classes for students with autism.</P>
        <P>Another function of the NCSE is to disseminate to schools and parents, and such other persons as the NCSE considers appropriate, information relating to best practice concerning the education of children with special educational needs.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie</P>
        <P>The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 380 classes have now been approved around the country, including over 40 at post-primary level.</P>

	<P>I can confirm to the Deputy that the school to which he refers has applied to my Department for additional accommodation to meet their anticipated need in September 2010. </P>
        <P>The application is currently being assessed in my Department.  A decision will issue to the school in question once the assessment of its application has been completed.  In relation to staffing the primary staffing schedule is currently structured to ensure that, on average, 1 teacher is allocated to primary schools for every 28 pupils  &mdash; every 27 pupils in the case of <Col N="516"/>medium to larger schools.  While the staffing schedule allocates on the basis of an average number of pupils each individual school decides on how to arrange its classes.</P>

        <P>In relation to the pupil teacher ratio the overall position is that my Department publishes extensive statistical information on it&rsquo;s website including figures in respect of pupil teacher ratios.  The most recently published figures relate to the 2008/2009 school year and show that the pupil teacher ratio at national level was an average of 1 teacher for every 15.9 pupils at primary level.</P>
        <P>The corresponding figures for the 2004-2005 school year was a PTR of 17.1 for primary level and 13.4 for post primary level.  Work is well advanced on the statistics for the current school year and it is planned to publish the results in September.  The preliminary indications are that the pupil teacher ratio in the current school year will be broadly in line with previous years.</P>

	<P>The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools.  My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  The Deputy will be aware that a Common Application System (CAS) was agreed between the principals of the post-primary schools in Limerick City.  This system has been facilitated through the Limerick Education Centre (LEC) with support from my Department.  Whilst this administrative system ensures that a co-ordinated approach can be taken to enrolments in the area, each school authority, in accordance with the Education Act, 1998, retains autonomy in relation to its own enrolment policy. </P>
        <P>A Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</P>
        <P>Any review of the CAS would require consultation with the relevant stakeholders involved.  My Department, at local level, also maintains contact with the relevant stakeholders, including, where necessary, discussing any issues that arise in relation to its operation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 541 to 543, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years.  This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs with reference to recent schools&rsquo; enrolment data.  The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 identified locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas.</P>
        <P>Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out detailed analysis and reports for each of these locations in order to identify the school accommodation requirements for each area up to and including the school year 2014/2015.  School accommodation requirements within the area referred have been considered as part of this detailed study of the identified areas.  The progression of all large scale building projects arising from Forward Planning Section&rsquo;s analysis of accommodation needs will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools is currently being undertaken by the Commission on School Accommodation.  A Technical Working Group, under the direction of the Chairman of the Commission, was established for this purpose.  This group has almost completed its work and it is expected that it will make recommendations to me shortly.  Among the many issues being considered by the Technical Working Group is the issue of how best to measure or gauge the views of parents in relation to diversity of school provision in a locality.</P>
        <P>I attach for the Deputy a list of the initial areas identified for detailed analysis.</P></Speaker><Col N="519"/>

        <Quest> the reasons a college of further education (details supplied) in Dublin 18 is not recognised as being accredited to deliver courses to Higher Certificate Level Six and Honours Degree Level Eight, even though the awards currently granted by the college are from Edexcel in the UK; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the college has already met the quality assurance requirements of Higher Education and Training Awards Council, Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin City University and Dundee University, Scotland and that the college is recognised as delivering innovative courses which have contributed to the recent success in the Oscars; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The College referred to by the Deputy is operated by City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee (CDVEC) and funded by my Department under the Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) Scheme as an approved PLC centre.  Under the terms and conditions of the PLC Scheme, courses provided by approved PLC centres must be at FETAC Level 5 or 6 or equivalent.  </P>
        <P>In respect of this approved PLC centre, my Department has facilitated the running of a course which is accredited by Dundee University as the equivalent of a Level 8 award on the National Framework of Qualifications (Honours Bachelor Degree/Higher Diploma) for the last number of years and continues to do so as an exceptional measure.</P>
        <P>It is open to this PLC centre to offer courses certified by other awarding bodies but these courses will not be funded by my Department unless they fulfil the terms and conditions of the PLC scheme.</P>

	<P>Teacher allocations to all second-level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.  The deployment of teaching staff, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the Board of Management of the school. </P>
        <P>In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e. curricular concessions.  This concession is available as a short term support to enable essential curricular provision to continue.  An application for curricular concessions was received from the school in question and an additional allocation of 1.27 wholetime equivalent teacher posts was granted.</P>
        <P>The allocation processes also include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against their allocation of teachers.  The school in question has availed of this appeals mechanism and will be notified of the outcome shortly.  The Appeals Board operates independently of my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 547 and 551 together.</P>
        <P>At primary level, Physical Education is one of seven curriculum areas within  the revised Primary School Curriculum which was introduced in 1999.  A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils.  The curriculum has been structured so as to allow individual schools a high degree of flexibility and choice in the planning of a broad and balanced Physical Education programme for pupils, and includes six broad strands featuring Athletics, Dance, Gymnastics, Games, Outdoor and adventure activities and Aquatics.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum.  The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department&rsquo;s approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered on the school timetable.</P>
        <P>A revised Physical Education programme in Physical Education as a non examination subject was introduced on a phased basis in 2003.  The programme includes adventure activities, aquatics, athletics, dance, invasion games, net and fielding games, gymnastics and health related activity.  In senior cycle, the physical education programme includes dance among the options which can be taken.  It should also be noted that some 50% of the student cohort now takes the Transition Year Programme where planning and performing in a school musical, many of which include dance,  is a popular option offered in schools.</P>
        <P>In addition, students may choose Dance as one of the courses available within the Arts component of the Leaving Certificate Applied programme (LCA).  The LCA is taken by some 7% of the student cohort and a maximum of 4 credits from a total of 200 credits in the assessment of the LCA is available for the Dance component.  The LCA does not provide for direct entry into higher education, but students may progress to Post Leaving Certificate courses and from there to higher education.</P>
        <P>My Department is faced with an extensive range of competing needs for investment in education, ranging from addressing educational disadvantage, inclusion of pupils with special needs and newcomer students, meeting the demands of a growing population, strengthening the mathematical, science, and technology aspects of provision, enhancing the professional development of teachers, investing in research and development and promoting second chance learning.  Within that context, investment in mainstreaming of dance education as an option within Art in the established Leaving Certificate is not a priority at the current time.</P>

	<P>The position is that applications have been received from three higher education institutions for designation as Universities; Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology and Cork Institute of Technology.</P>
        <P>The issue of university designation does not just affect the institutions and the regions from which applications have been received; it also impacts on the future structure of the higher education system throughout the country.  The  Government wants to build on our strengths and to provide an environment where all our higher education institutions can develop in a way that best serves the country as a whole as well as the regions where they are based.</P>
        <P>A High Level Group is currently developing a new national strategy for higher education.  That Group is critically examining the roles and relationships of higher education institutions so that the system can deliver the levels of efficiency, performance, innovation and growth that will optimise Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;smart&rsquo; economic recovery and social development.  The Strategy Group are expected to finalise their report before the summer and there are no plans to advance any of the current applications for university status before the Group completes its work.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy on the number of special needs assistants employed in schools in Waterford city is not readily available in the requested format.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE)  is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs  Organisers (SENO) for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants  to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.</P>
        <P>The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on  a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs  leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any  surplus identified.  Furthermore, schools can make applications at any time with  the result that the individual situation of any school can change and allocations are not static.  The Deputy may wish to liaise directly with the NCSE in the context of his enquiry.</P>
        <P>I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that children with special  educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their  needs.  The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and  teachers and resources will continue to be allocated to schools to meet  children&rsquo;s needs in line with my Department&rsquo;s policy.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational  Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning  Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Schools that do not currently have NEPS  psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can  have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private  psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS.</P>
        <P>In common with many other psychological services and best international  practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school  takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial  intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist.  Only if  there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best  efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  This  system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and  also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It  also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological  intervention.</P>
        <P>I have made enquiries with my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological  Service in relation to the pupil referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question and can  confirm that while the NEPS psychologist assigned to the relevant school is  aware of the case, no approach has been made by school authorities in relation  to the current assessment or review of the child.  The NEPS service is available  to provide any relevant assistance requested by school authorities in this  instance and I would suggest that the child&rsquo;s parents raise the matter with the  school principal.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Martin Ferris</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> the number of persons in her Department and offices under her aegis employed in the civil and public service who are in receipt of a State pension. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>At the recruitment stage, once the Department becomes aware that an officer is in receipt of a public service pension, arrangements are put in place in order  that the pension is abated for the duration of their employment with this  Department.  Officers who join the Department with previous public service can  opt to preserve their benefits until pension age or if they so wish, they can  opt to transfer their service, if appropriate for inclusion in the civil service pension schemes.</P>
        <P>At present my Department has an educational psychologist who is a former  retired school teacher.  On his appointment to the National Educational  Psychological Service (NEPS) the payment of his teacher&rsquo;s pension ceased.</P>
        <P>In relation to bodies under the aegis of my Department the information sought  by the Deputy is not readily available.  I have requested officials at my  Department to compile the information and forward it to the Deputy when it is  to hand.</P>
