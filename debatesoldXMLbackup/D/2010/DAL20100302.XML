      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Was the Taoiseach contacted recently by members of the Green Party about appointments that were made of former or failed Green Party candidates to State boards?  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, appointed Mr. Vincent P. Martin and Ms Gene Feighery who lost their seats in local elections to serve on the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  Mr. Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in was appointed a Senator by the Taoiseach.  Ms Burrell, who lost her seat in the local elections, was appointed to the National Disability Authority.  The former Green Party secretary general, Mr. Nutty, was appointed to An Foras Org&aacute;nach, the new organic food group.  A further Green Party politician, Ms Davidson, who failed to win a seat in last year&rsquo;s Dublin South by-election, is a classifier with the IFCO.  There are also a number of assistant classifiers who are former Fianna F&aacute;il politicians, including Mr. Sheridan and three ex-Members of the Seanad, including former Senators Bennett, Fitzgerald and McGuinness.  I note that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, recently appointed a friend and well-known active Fianna F&aacute;il canvasser to the board of the National Transport Authority.  Did the Green Party consult the Taoiseach about those appointments?  In his capacity as Head of Government, does the Taoiseach think this is the way to conduct the nation&rsquo;s business?  Does he think it would be appropriate to advertise these positions?  Does he have any belief in Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal that the chairpersons of such organisations should at least be asked to appear before the appropriate Oireachtas committee to tell members what they have to offer in terms of their appointment?  Does the Taoiseach not think that would be a broad and more comprehensive response?  He is the Taoiseach and while there are many people who do not vote for him or his party, he is still their Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>He is the Taoiseach for all the people.  If I represent a half a million people who do not vote for him, he is still the Taoiseach.  If appointments are to be made to these boards, does he not think it would be appropriate that, in respect of the chairmanships, there should at least be a broader and more comprehensive strategy than merely appointing failed politicians or, in this case, members of the Green Party or Fianna F&aacute;il?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not contacted concerning every appointment to every board.  As regards appointments to the Seanad, I am obviously satisfied about Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in&rsquo;s suitability <Col N="675"/>for the post.  The fact that someone is a current or former public representative does not disqualify them from service. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Certainly not. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure there are many other occupations, including accountants, solicitors, farmers and doctors, which may be suitable depending on the tasks undertaken by a given board.  That should determine the suitability of any person to be a member of the board.  I have no reason to believe that, in respect of any of the organisations the Deputy mentioned, those people would not be qualified to do such a task.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Nor am I suggesting that former political, public representatives should not be appointed.  I am not suggesting that at all.  I am just naming ten or 12 who happen to be persons who either failed to hold their seats or belong to a particular political party.  We discussed this matter before with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor on many occasions.  It is difficult to get good people to serve on boards in many instances.  Would the Taoiseach not take into account what the Minister for Finance said about this in response to questions I asked him?  He said it would be useful for the Oireachtas to involve the appropriate Oireachtas committee at some stage in some of these appointments.</P>
        <P>When there is a vacancy on a State agency&rsquo;s board, one can go through a list of party supporters, or Green Party supporters.  However, there may well be others who might have something genuine to bring to that board but they never get a look in.  Such positions could be advertised, although one might get too many applications.  Alternatively, to get the best from the appointments to be made, one could say: &ldquo;These are important positions.  I&rsquo;d like you to go before the Oireachtas committee and tell the members what it is that you will bring to the job with your expertise and experience, be you a former public representative or not.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the bodies are probably quangos that are going to go anyway.  However, in the interests of having the very best people who want to participate, it should not just be confined to selected personnel.  Does the Taoiseach agree it is appropriate that the Minister for Finance, by accepting my recommendation following the publication of Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s Bill some time ago, should involve the relevant Oireachtas committee with regard to some of these appointments, perhaps not all of them, but certainly the more important ones?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I was making was that membership of the boards is not limited to specific personnel or people of a specific background, nor does it exclude people with a political background.  The majority of the people appointed to the boards are not known to me personally, but if they are vouched for by the relevant line Minister as people he believes suitable for appointment, I accept that the people with the line responsibility have made inquiries and appointed them on the basis of their skills, qualifications or general experience.  As the Deputy knows, dealing with the non-executive functions of a board and governance of an organisation does not require technical executive types.  It requires people with an overall understanding of the role and remit of the organisation who can bring something to the table to assist that organisation execute its remit.  Also, the person&rsquo;s own experience is part of the relevant criteria in being able to contribute to a board.</P>
        <P>It is open to any Oireachtas committee to invite a chairman and chief executive to appear before a committee at any time to discuss issues regarding general governance and the areas of expertise applicable to board structures or membership.  There is a provision under the Broadcasting Act for involvement.  Therefore, the remit and scope of these things varies from <Col N="676"/>Department to Department and board to board.  The overall criteria we need to apply is that people be appointed on the basis of relevant skills, qualifications and experience and that they are people whom one would trust in terms of their public service and the role they will play on the board.  It is open to any member of the public or any person at any time to represent himself or herself as suitable for a board appointment and it is a matter for the relevant Minister or deciding officer to decide in any particular case whether the people available are suitable for appointment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor admitted to me here that a number of the appointments he made were based on friendship, not ability.  For example, the chairman of the Dublin Port and Docks board was appointed on the basis of friendship, not ability.  I am glad to hear the Taoiseach say appointments should be on the basis of people&rsquo;s credentials and the quality of what they can bring to the board to which they are appointed.  It is open to any of the relevant committees to call in chairmen &mdash; who may refuse or consent to appear &mdash; but these chairmen have already been appointed.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in the case of important appointments the persons proposed should appear at the relevant Oireachtas committee before their appointment?  This would allow them put forward their assessment of what they can bring to the board to which they are to be appointed.  In the case of at least six of the people I mentioned who were appointed to various boards, did the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government consult with the Taoiseach to get his imprimatur for the appointments?  They are very confined and narrowly based.  I am not saying they are not good people, but Deputy Gormley has six of his either failed or current supporters appointed to boards.  He did not do that off his own bat and had to have the Taoiseach&rsquo;s consent.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether he gave that consent?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thought I made it clear that appointments to some boards do not require my consent.  I do not micro-manage board appointments by Ministers.  Certain appointments to statutory bodies must come before the Government, other appointments are dealt with by Ministers.  There may be some occasions when a board is being constituted where discussion takes place with me, but in the main I leave the decisions to the Ministers concerned.  Where appointments are to be made in which the Government has an interest, this will be brought to the attention of the Government as a matter of course.  However, for certain bodies, Government approval of appointments is required under legislation, although these are a minority.</P>
        <P>The general criteria for suitability are qualifications and experience.  The Deputy mentioned some names that, as far as I can recall, were not brought to my attention.  However, I will leave it to the Minister concerned to deal with those issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Renewed Programme for Government contains a commitment that the Government will introduce, on a legislative basis, a more open and transparent system for appointments to public bodies.  It states that this legislation will outline a procedure for the advertising of all vacancies and the inviting of applications from those interested in being appointed; it will also allow for the creation of a panel of suitable applicants and provide a mechanism for consideration of appointments by the appropriate Oireachtas committee.  When will we see that legislation?</P>
        <P Just="Left">If this is Government policy on appointments to public bodies &mdash; I presume it is, otherwise it would not be in the programme to Government &mdash; why can the Government not practise it now, rather than preaching it?  What is to prevent the Government from applying these principles immediately and on a continuing basis, rather than waiting for the legislation?  Why, for example, did the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources recently make <Col N="677"/>an appointment to a post at the Commission for Energy Regulation, with a salary of &euro;165,000, without any advertising?  I understand around a third of all Green Party councillors who lost their seats at the local elections last June have now been appointed to State bodies.  Why does the Government not apply its proposed policy now?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach responded to an earlier question by saying he did not want to micro-manage his Ministers.  It is widely expected that the Taoiseach will have an extensive Cabinet reshuffle and realignment of Departments.  What steps is he taking in anticipation of significant changes in the Cabinet?  Is he taking steps to ensure that those he does not intend to reappoint will not be appointing people all over the place before the reshuffle?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Especially the Green Party members.  They have learned a lot.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Deputy on his dexterous attempt to introduce a supplementary question that has nothing whatever to do with the question.  I cannot answer any speculation about that matter and I have no comment to make on it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question that was relevant, I stated previously in the House that the detail and scope of the legislation envisaged in the programme for Government has yet to be worked out; therefore, the commitment is to put the changes on a legislative basis.  In the meantime, as with all commitments, the existing arrangements apply until the new arrangements are put in place, which will be during the remainder of the period covered by the programme for Government &mdash; that is, the next couple of years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is preparing the legislation?  When I asked this before, the Taoiseach seemed to think it would come from the Department of Finance.  Which Minister will present the detailed proposals to the Government?</P>
        <P>The policy mentioned in the Renewed Programme for Government is very explicit.  It would provide for the publication of all vacancies likely to occur, the inviting of applications from the general public and, from the responses, the creation of a panel of suitable persons for consideration for appointment.  The legislation will also specify the number of persons to be appointed by Ministers and facilitate the appropriate Oireachtas committees in making nominations to the panel.</P>
        <P>Why is this practice not being followed?  I presume it is Government policy and although we will have to wait for the legislation to come forward, why is the Government not practising what it preaches?  The policy was put in the programme for Government so why are the appointments made by Ministers not subject to what is now meant to be Government policy?</P>
        <P>I understand the Cabinet handbook has an arrangement where when appointments are made, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and any other party leader in Government will be informed separately in advance of any such proposal.  Is that still the practice?  How many leaders of parties are there in Government?  At one stage this was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are drifting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to know who is consulted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are essentially meant to be talking about appointments to State boards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is consulted?  The Cabinet handbook mentions the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and any other party leader.  Do I understand from this that the consultation process is confined to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage <Col N="678"/>and Local Government or is any other Minister included in the arrangement for approving appointments to various State bodies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That relates to the two leaders of the Government and the T&aacute;naiste where appropriate.  Programme managers are put in place to deal with some of the mechanics of these issues.  To return to the Deputy&rsquo;s points on the legislative basis for systems of appointments to public bodies, that will have to be pursued and the scope will have to be worked out in the first instance.  It will then be ready for assignment and until that happens we will proceed with existing arrangements.  The programme for Government has a reference to the matter and we will work through it on that basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does this need legislation at all?  The only people who can make these appointments make up the Government, therefore, it must be asked if legislation is needed to govern what should be good practice.  If the practice that should apply has been agreed among the parties in Government, as is reflected  in the programme for Government, why is it not put in place?  Is legislation really needed to give effect to something already agreed in the programme for Government?  There is nothing to stop it being implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A commitment has been made to put it in legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Somebody got codded when this was being written.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  There is already a Broadcasting Act provision that relates to a reference to Oireachtas committees in respect of appointments to boards.  Some issues arose even when the committee dealt with that issue so there is a need to ensure the matter is handled properly and appropriately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to reflect on the revised programme for Government.  Deputy Gilmore quoted from the particular section of the programme which appears under the heading &ldquo;Enhancing our democracy and public services.&rdquo;  I agree that we should work towards legislation.  Out of a renegotiated programme for Government, do both Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party recognise that enhancing our democracy and public services could find a contribution from the proposals laid down in the section as already put on the record by Deputy Gilmore?  Surely in that recognition both parties could agree to practice what they have already negotiated and agreed?  That would be a contributory factor to, as the heading states, enhancing our democracy and public services.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach give an indication this afternoon that he will speed up the processing of the legislation?  At what stage is the preparatory process?  Has preparation of the legislation even begun?</P>
        <P>Concerns have often been expressed over many years by Members of the Opposition, including me, about the appointment of citizens to State bodies.  Will the Taoiseach speak to the leader of the Green Party to bring about the respective changes in advance of the legislation?  Will he ensure that the legislation is fast tracked to give legislative status to the specific areas such as the number of appointments to be made by Ministers, and the number who should appropriately be nominated by Oireachtas committees?  There are people out there who could bring a wealth of experience to many of these bodies, yet whose names do not appear on the short-lists that come into circulation from within a very closed shop <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the respective Departments.  In the renegotiated programme for Government, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party agreed that the process should be opened up significantly and that the conduct of this <Col N="679"/>business should be improved.  Will the Taoiseach undertake to initiate the practice and fast-track the legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have stated in previous replies that the scope and detail of this legislation have yet to be worked out.  To give any commitment before that is done would be rather speculative, so I will not do that.  I have already outlined the approach for the bodies provided under the Broadcasting Act 2009.  Different boards require different approaches, and each needs to be treated on an individual basis.  When bringing forward proposals on any future State boards, I am satisfied that each Minister will provide for the most appropriate bases from which to draw their membership.  We have to bring forward legislation on this, but we have had a tried and tested system in place.  From my ministerial experience, I have often acted on recommendations by people who I personally did not know.  Obviously, I knew the person in some cases, but in other cases I did not.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is all about finding people with the relevant qualifications and criteria that are needed to fill the vacancies.  We might need somebody with accountancy skills, somebody with proven business acumen, or somebody who has acted as some kind of public interest director.  It depends on the board we are talking about or the vacancy that has arisen.  All these criteria must be examined and a balance found when a board is being constituted.  I usually find that is the case.  There is often a problem in finding a suitably qualified person who would give his or her time to serve on a board.  There is an open invitation to all citizens who feel they could play a constructive role to contact the relevant Minister or Department concerned, and then they can be considered in the event of a vacancy arising.</P>
        <P>It is not my experience that there is a closed shop.  It is all about trying to find people who are eminent in taxation institutes, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Law Society and so on who might have something to contribute and whose skill sets are relevant to ensuring that the board discharges its governance duties and keeps executives to account.  That has to be continuously monitored.</P>

	<P>Having already acknowledged the importance of making these changes, one would feel there would be no resistance to moving ahead with some speed to implement them, either in practice now or following legislation.  However, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply did not indicate that there is any urgency on his part.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy put a question to the Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach provided an affirmation in respect of the good sense of making these changes.  Does he accept that, under the current system &mdash; and as Deputy Kenny highlighted in outlining a list of recent appointments to a number of State boards and agencies &mdash; the likelihood is that political parties will&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy ask a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked a question.  The only way to open the system up to the wider public is to place the relevant information in the public arena and invite applications.  Such applications could then be given due consideration and appointments could be made.  It is a fairly straightforward proposition.  Will the Taoiseach provide Members with a little more hope to the effect that the stated commitment in the programme for Government to enhance our democracy and public services is something which both parties in the current Administration intend to honour?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="680"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I indicated that there are many statutory duties which Ministers must fulfil.  One of these duties, which must be discharged, is to make appointments to State boards.  If there are those inside or outside the House who know people who might possess the relevant experience and who would be suitable for appointment to State boards, they should bring the matter to the attention of the relevant Ministers.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the commitment in the programme for Government to establish a more transparent system for appointments to public bodies that will facilitate the appropriate Oireachtas committees to make nominations for consideration for appointment.  Under this system, the relevant committees would simply put forward names for consideration.  I respectfully suggest that names can be put forward without the &ldquo;by your leave&rdquo; of Government.  It is possible to submit names at any time.  The argument that has been used with regard to the Government introducing legislation can also be used in this instance.  Committee members can put forward names for consideration.  The scope and remit of the new system must be developed in accordance with the experience relating to nominations under the Broadcasting Act.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Procedurally, requests for use of this service are made by Ministers&rsquo; private secretaries to my office and are dealt with, in the first instance, by the staff of my office.  Requests are examined by my staff with regard to the need for and purpose of travel, the destination and other logistical details.  Any necessary clarification or further information is sought at this point.  All screened requests are then submitted to me for consideration and approval, if deemed appropriate.  Once approved, all operational matters are settled directly between the office of the relevant Minister and the Department of Defence or the Air Corps.</P>
        <P>In 2009, I approved 105 requests for use by Ministers or Ministers of State of Air Corps aircraft.  I have considered the requests submitted to me since I became Taoiseach to be appropriate and have approved them.  All applications for use of such services are considered in the context of the demands of official duties with due regard to costs and efficiencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for clarifying that the Government jet moves on his authorisation.  Will he clarify the position with regard to what happened on Sunday, 3 February 2008, when the Government jet was in the United States as a result of a visit there by the Minister for Health and Children?  On that date the Minister and her husband had a private day, to which both are entitled.  The Minister attended the Super Bowl in Phoenix, Arizona, that evening and stayed in the city of Prescott, which is approximately 100 miles from Phoenix.  For some inexplicable reason &mdash; perhaps there is a reason &mdash; the Government jet flew from Phoenix to Las Vegas, Nevada, and remained there overnight.  We are informed that no <Col N="681"/>one other than Air Corps personnel were on board at the time.  On the following day, the jet flew back to Phoenix to collect the Minister and her party.  I understand a case was put forward that this was due to meteorological conditions.  Yet a map indicates that Tucson, Arizona and San Diego, California are closer than or as close as Las Vegas.  If a request for movement of the Government jet comes before the staff of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office and clarification must be sought by him, can the Taoiseach explain the reason the Government jet flew from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada and stayed overnight if there were no personnel on board?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is going into detail that may be more appropriate to the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is about authorisation for flying the Government jet at &euro;7,100 an hour.  Was clarification given to the Taoiseach for that movement of the jet and did he authorise it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My function is simply to approve the use of the service.  If Deputy Kenny wishes to have detailed records of any flights undertaken I understand they are maintained by the Department of Defence and that question should be tabled specifically to that Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comment that his function is to give authorisation for use of the service.  The service was used from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas.  If the Taoiseach&rsquo;s function is to give authorisation for the use of the service, was he asked for that authorisation and did he give it?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The meteorological records from the US National Agricultural Statistics Service provide a national weather summary for the period from 3 February to 9 February 2008.  It shows that in Arizona on 3 February and 4 February 2008 snowfall totals were as high as 27 inches in a place called Happy Jack &mdash; I do not know where that is.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In any event, I am anxious to find out from the Taoiseach whether he was asked for authorisation for the use of this service to move the Gulfstream jet from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas overnight.  What was the purpose of that movement?  Did the Taoiseach authorise it?  We know from records that the jet flew from Las Vegas to Phoenix the following day to pick up the Minister for Health and Children who had travelled from Prescott to Phoenix by limousine at a cost of more than &euro;500.  As I stated, the Minister was entitled to her private day with her husband.  Has the Taoiseach been informed of the reason for the movement of the jet from Phoenix to Las Vegas?  Why was it requested?  Was he told about it and did he authorise it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I authorise the provision of the aircraft for the purpose of ministerial visits to a country.  I do not deal with operational matters that occur when people get there.  If the Deputy has any questions on operational matters a phone call to the Department of Defence will get him the answer rather than looking up the Internet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question on operational matters.  In another incident, for some reason the same jet flew to Kingston, Jamaica with a previous Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is getting bogged down in detail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach stated in his reply that when a request for movement of the jet comes in it is dealt with initially by his staff.  Thereafter, the clearance is to be given <Col N="682"/>by the Taoiseach.  In answer to a supplementary question, he stated his job in this regard is to authorise use of the service.  He has now asked me whether I have a question on operational matters and I do.  What was the purpose of moving the Government jet from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada?  The newspaper reports from the time indicated that only Air Corp personnel were on board.  Why was it necessary to move the jet from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas?  Was the Taoiseach, as the person who must give authorisation for the use of the service, consulted about this and did he authorise it?  If he was not asked or did not authorise it, can we get from him or his office a follow up response as to why the jet travelled to Las Vegas and back to Phoenix?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to figure out where Deputy Kenny is coming from in all of this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was appointed Taoiseach on 7 May 2008.  Deputy Kenny referred to a flight that took place on 3 February 2008.  I had no involvement in the matter.  That is the first point.</P>
        <P>The second point is that in my reply to Deputy Kenny I said that any Taoiseach of the day provides the authorisation to use the Government jet for ministerial visits abroad.  As Deputy Kenny knows ministerial air transport services are needed for the proper conduct of Government business.  When the Deputy raised a query about a technical issue that arose while Air Corps personnel went from one airport to another, I made the point that operational matters and details have to be taken up with the Department of Defence.  The Taoiseach is not involved in any change of arrangements that take place for whatever technical reasons that arise on flights.  If Deputy Kenny does not know that, he should know it.  It is absurd to indicate that people would have to ring my office at 3 a.m. to find out whether they can move from one airport to another.  That does not happen.  Decisions and operational responsibilities are taken by the flight personnel themselves.  Answers to any queries on the matter can be directly obtained from the Department of Defence.  For the record, I did not hold the office of Taoiseach at the time but that is not to say any issue arises either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that point.  The Taoiseach is also now the acting Minister for Defence.  He can take it that I will ask him, as Minister for Defence, to find out how and why this happened.  I accept he was not Taoiseach at that stage but on an operational matter this jet did move from city to city.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I explained, nor would the Taoiseach of the day have been involved in that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but the Minister for Defence is the person who has the record.  As the Taoiseach is now the Minister for Defence, I ask him that question.  We will see how he responds to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No problem.  I will get the file.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply to Deputy Kenny and I understand from it that there was no request for approval of a flight from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas and that no such approval was granted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore cannot take that as being the case.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="683"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>But that is what I heard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore did not hear that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Which is it then?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I am saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Was it approved or not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very simple.  As I have explained and as Deputy Gilmore is aware, the Taoiseach of the day authorises the use of the jet.  When the jet takes off from Baldonnel on its ministerial visit or other trip, the decisions on whatever technical issues or operational details that arise are taken by the flight personnel themselves.  The Department of Defence holds the records and if people have any queries on those records they put the question to the Department of Defence.  No Taoiseach of the day is involved in clearance of the subsequent details that arose.  The question that arises in the first instance is the authorisation by the Taoiseach of the use of the Government jet for the trip to America.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>To Phoenix.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Thereafter, whatever arises is dealt with by the Department of Defence.  That is what I am saying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a case that when the jet is out of Irish airspace it is free to go where it likes.  Presumably, there is a procedure in place for when a Minister who has been approved for, let us say, a flight from Dublin to Madrid on Government business then decides he has to fly to Rome on Government business.  What is the procedure?  Is the Minister free to go on the flight from Madrid to Rome or is he required to seek additional approval from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office for the second flight?  It would be helpful if we knew that.</P>
        <P>I also wish to ask the Taoiseach about his visit to Copenhagen for the climate change summit.  There was a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> that the Government jet had to make two return trips to bring him to and from that event.  Apparently, when the Government jet got to Copenhagen to bring the Taoiseach to the climate change conference it could not find anywhere to park and it had to come home and go out again to bring him back.  That was a total of four flights when there otherwise might have been two.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, who is seated beside the Taoiseach, will be interested in this issue.  I understand it is Government policy that there will be a carbon off-set for the use of the Government jet.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether the jet had to do a double run to bring the Taoiseach to and from Copenhagen?  If so, has the carbon impact of that been calculated?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are getting far away from Arizona.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the impact of the use of the jet is to be made up by way of growing trees in urban areas.  In which town can we find the urban forest that compensates for the double trip to Copenhagen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore is in a facetious mood today whatever is wrong with him.  The decision to return to Baldonnel Aerodrome before travelling back to Copenhagen was made by the Air Corps for operational reasons.  The Copenhagen Airport authority advised the Air Corps that due the large number of aircraft expected for the summit, the GIV jet could not overnight in Copenhagen.  Having regard to this, the Air Corps received permission to <Col N="684"/>return to Baldonnel on 17 December and reposition to Copenhagen on 18 December to complete the mission.  This was done in order to facilitate essential pilot training and for reasons of operational expediency.</P>
        <P>All Government flights are taken into account in regard to carbon off-sets and I am sure this particular flight will be included in that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach respond to the first part of my question?  If, for example, a Minister has permission to go to Madrid by Government jet but then has to travel on to Rome, would he or she have to apply for a second clearance from the Department of the Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to check with my office what the technical arrangements would be in that case.  Ministers who have use of the jet are on official business and that is fine.  However, I will have to check the details of the hypothetical scenario set out by the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept there will be times where the schedules and responsibilities of the Taoiseach or a Minister will not coincide with the schedules of commercial flights.  Rather than going over what has already been said, I have a simple question.  Has any cost analysis been done in respect of the possibility of chartering a jet in order to meet the occasional need for travel beyond what the commercial schedules will accommodate?  Is there a cost saving involved in using commercial flights in the main and chartering a jet only when required rather than having to maintain a dedicated aircraft?  It is reasonable to assume there might be.  If such a cost analysis has not been carried out, will the Taoiseach undertake to ensure it is done so that we may be better informed as to what savings might be achieved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, there is a requirement for a ministerial air transport service.  There is an ongoing requirement for the Government and the President to maintain active economic, political and cultural relations with countries not only in Europe but across the globe.  We regularly have to participate in international discussions and negotiations with bodies such as the European Union and the United Nations.  Fulfilling those international obligations necessarily involves substantial air travel by members of Government and the President.  The travel arrangements required cannot always be met by commercial airline companies, which is why we need the service we have.  It provides the Government and the President with an independent, flexible and effective air transport service that helps us to meet our international obligations.</P>
        <P>Maintaining a dedicated aircraft has several advantages over a reliance on commercial air travel.  The service is more flexible in that it is not tied to set routes, timetables or schedules.  For example, where European Union meetings end up taking longer than expected, it is vital that departure times can be altered as required at short notice.  The service helps Ministers to fulfil all their duties both at home and abroad to the greatest extent possible and to carry out those duties with the maximum efficiency having regard to increasingly busy portfolios and the availability of the service for special tasks.  In times of crisis it ensures independence of movement for those who require it.  In short, it is a matter of recognising that the commercial airline industry does not provide sufficiently for the workings of modern government in any country.  This service is necessary to ensure people can attend to their duties and do their business on behalf of the country and can return as quickly as possible once those duties are fulfilled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach undertake to perform a cost analysis in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="685"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As for a cost analysis, one instance pertains to the loss of days and times, as well as the overnight stays that would be involved in being obliged to stay overnight in other locations, rather than getting back to fulfil duties at home.  The commercial airline industry does not fulfil all the requirements for a flexible and efficient service with which Ministers can do their jobs, both at home and abroad, as one would expect them to.</P>

        <Quest> his proposals to promote electric transport this year. </Quest>
        <QRef>[10455/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Government has ambitious plans for the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  A target has been set of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020, which would equate to approximately 225,000 cars on Irish roads.  Electric vehicles are an increasingly realistic solution to the challenge of reducing the transport sector&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions and reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels.  There is now significant global investment under way in research and development in this area.  The technology is maturing to a point where large-scale commercial deployment appears feasible in the short to medium term.  There is keen interest at EU level and internationally in Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to be an early mover in this field.  Ireland is seen as an excellent test bed, particularly in respect of its network infrastructure development.  The challenge now is to develop economically viable options for the establishment, cost-efficient operation and maintenance of an electric vehicle infrastructure network in Ireland, together with measures to develop a market for the vehicles themselves.</P>
        <P>ESB Networks is playing a central role in the research and development of the infrastructure network.  The ESB also is playing a leading role in work by European utilities and car manufacturers to further essential standardisation across Europe.  I have given my support to the current Spanish Presidency in highlighting electric vehicles as a key EU priority.  I also have welcomed the recent confirmation by the European Commission that it is to begin work on the standardisation agenda.  The interdepartmental-interagency task force has assessed the costed options and timeframes for putting in place the necessary infrastructure and other arrangements for the cost-effective deployment of electric vehicles on a national basis.  Initial estimates by ESB Networks for the roll-out of infrastructure are between six and 18 months, depending on the scale of initial deployment.  Global developments will be factored in as the technologies mature.</P>
        <P>The introduction of incentives to assist in the roll-out of electric vehicles, as set out in budget 2010, is being furthered by my Department and the Department of Finance.  As the Minister for Finance stated in his Budget Statement, it is intended that incentive systems will be in place to coincide with the arrival of the first electric vehicles later this year or at the same time as the agreed arrival of electric vehicles from a number of car manufacturers.</P>
        <P>My Department and the ESB have already agreed a memorandum of understanding with Renault-Nissan that provides for ongoing information exchange on developments.  Discussions also are under way with a number of other car manufacturers, with a view to developing memoranda of understanding with them.  I understand there are several promising prospects in this regard for later this year.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="686"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I welcome the commitment by the Spanish Presidency that this issue should be one of the key priorities for the European Union during its presidency.  I also welcome the initial moves by the EU towards standardisation in respect of plugs, charging and so on.  My concern is with the Government&rsquo;s lethargy in driving forward this agenda.  I acknowledge the Minister agrees with me that this is a technology which can transform the transport sector in Ireland, can deal in a highly impressive way with an emissions problem in that sector and can act as an exciting new development for the energy sector, particularly with regard to dealing with intermittency issues pertaining to wind generation.  Is the Minister satisfied that ESB Networks is doing enough in respect of its proposed pilot projects?  My understanding from the Minister&rsquo;s reply on 26 January last is that ESB Networks intends to put in place 20 charging points as a national pilot project.  How many charging points does the Minister envisage being installed during the six to 18 months timeframe in which ESB Networks is involved?  Second, a number of months have passed since a memorandum of understanding was put in place with Renault-Nissan.  What has been the result and how many cars can one expect will come into Ireland from that company?  Does Ireland have the infrastructure to be able to facilitate this?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have one or two other brief questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will revert to the Deputy but I wish to ensure that Members receive a full answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am satisfied the ESB is doing the right thing and is doing enough.  It is a staged roll-out and I understand it has already started.  There is a charging point outside my own office and a number of other locations but that is only the beginning.  It is intended to deal first with a number of our cities and then to consider connecting them.  I had an interesting meeting last week with officials from the British Government&rsquo;s Department that is involved in this area to ascertain whether work in Dublin and Belfast could be co-ordinated to develop a corridor.  Such a corridor, in which two systems are connected, would be highly progressive.  Consequently, I am fully confident that the ESB is performing the correct analysis and that Ireland is a good and proper test location for this technology because the distances are not insurmountable.  I am also confident that the roll-out of the charging points will be sufficient to meet the needs of approximately 6,000 vehicles initially over the first three years but with the objective of increasing this number to 200,000 vehicles by the end of this decade and thereafter to go on to transform the entire fleet.</P>
        <P>This is the opportunity that is open to us.  I agree with the Deputy that we share an ambition on this issue to the effect that our renewable variable supply and single distributed network give us a competitive advantage.  The United Kingdom has six different grids, which makes it difficult for it.  As one would not wish to be dependent on any single vehicle or company, I understand the memorandum of understanding with organisations such as Renault-Nissan might lead to one third, one quarter or a percentage of the vehicles that are needed, which is appropriate.  Were two or three car companies to deliver 2,000 vehicles each, it would set us up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask both the Minister and the Deputy to be more concise in their answers and questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify, the Minister has stated that over the next three years, we will deploy 6,000 vehicles and then, over the following six years, he intends to deliver 244,000 vehicles.  This is what Members are being told because the target for 2020, which is <Col N="687"/>only ten years away, is to have 250,000 such vehicles.  My concern is that although Ireland is engaged in pilot projects, it should propose itself as a pilot project for the European Union.  I am frustrated with this lack of ambition because I do not believe Ireland can ramp up from 3,000 vehicles to 250,000 vehicles in the space of six years.  I refer in the first instance to the requisite infrastructure to facilitate this.  I am highly concerned that we are progressing too cautiously in this regard and as a result will not receive the benefits associated with being a first mover in respect of technology, smart charging, software and everything else because we simply will be overtaken by other countries&rsquo; levels of ambition</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is exactly our ambition to be a test bed for the technology.  Our first requirement was to get any vehicles as there is a queue of countries who seeking to be in Ireland&rsquo;s position, having been able to have signed a memorandum of understanding with Renault-Nissan and hopefully with other companies such as Mitsubishi.  First, this will give us the opportunity of having some vehicles, because certain countries that will seek vehicles will not be able to have access to them, to turn Ireland into a test bed facility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Three thousand vehicles.  Is that it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have been informed by both the ESB and my Department that 6,000 vehicles is a sufficient number to provide us with a proper test bed location in which we can develop the software technology and data management technology that comprises the real economic opportunity for Ireland behind the development of electric vehicles, as well as managing our renewable electricity supply.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 33 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the making of a levy order by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for the purposes of meeting the expenses of the authority and its committees in undertaking the performance of its statutory functions.  As I have made clear in my replies to previous questions on this issue, the setting of the levy is a matter for the authority and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
        <P>In addition, in accordance with section 37 of the Act, the setting of the budget for the BAI for any particular year is a matter for the authority.  While the legislation makes provision for the Minister to be able to specify the form the estimates should take and any additional information as may be needed, it does not require the estimates to be submitted for specific ministerial approval.  The budget for 2010 was set by the BAI at &euro;7.6 million at its meeting in December 2009.</P>
        <P>As I also have previously stated, the BAI has indicated that the need for an increased budget over those previously provided for under the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is as a result of the increased role given by the Oireachtas to the BAI.  While the BAI has taken over the functions of the BCI and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, BCC, it has also been given a range of new functions in addition to those held by its predecessors, mainly in respect of public service broadcasting and the provision of digital broadcasting services.  The BAI has also indicated that the extent to which any budget is expended will depend on the level of activity of the organisation in any one year.</P><Col N="688"/>
        <P>The BAI has confirmed that it will discharge its functions in a cost effective manner and is conscious of not imposing an undue burden on the broadcasting sector.  In this context, section 32(4) of the Broadcasting Act requires the authority to ensure that regulation by it and the statutory committees does not involve the imposition or maintenance of unnecessary administrative burdens.</P>
        <P>I have made clear to the authority the need to be vigilant about keeping costs down, particularly in the current economic climate.  The authority has requested the chief executive to review the detail of the 2010 budget with a view to reducing it where possible and the chief executive will shortly report to the authority on this.</P>
        <P>In accordance with section 37(7) of the Act, any 2010 Revised Estimate of income and expenditure approved by the authority will be published on the BAI&rsquo;s website with my consent and that of the Minister for Finance.  The authority has also asked the chief executive to review its proposed expenditure throughout 2010 continuously with the aim of reducing it where possible.  In accordance with section 33 of the Act, any surplus of levy income over expenditure in a given year shall be offset against future levies or refunded, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>In addition, the chief executive met commercial radio broadcasters last week to discuss the levy and the 2010 budget and sought to address any issues and concerns that these stakeholders may have had on this issue.  I understand that the chief executive has undertaken to have a further meeting with the commercial radio broadcasters once the budget review mentioned has been completed to the satisfaction of the authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The name Pontius Pilate comes to mind.  Does the Minister not accept that he cannot hide behind the broadcasting authority as regards the undue burden that he is responsible for placing on the independent radio sector in particular and that he cannot walk away from it now, since it is a direct result of decisions and legislation he has introduced?  Secondary legislation will not come into force until Thursday, so I urge him again to ensure that this order is annulled to allow for a fresh start.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister received the types of submission I have received from independent and local radio stations from the south east, Munster, the midlands, Dublin and Connacht-Ulster?  People who are concerned about their jobs cannot believe that this system of levies will be imposed with no recognition of the impact on the budgets within which radio stations are struggling to survive.  Does the Minister not accept that, for example, the percentage of advertising revenue has mushroomed as regards the levy?  He must bear responsibility for what has occurred.  I urge him to come out from behind the BAI.  We are discussing secondary legislation, so he can still ensure that fairness comes into play.  He should do so because he promised in the House that an undue burden would not be placed on those who are struggling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that fairness has a part of play.  I have a similar concern to the Deputy&rsquo;s regarding the jobs of those in broadcasters across the State, particularly in the independent radio broadcasting sector, that are facing difficult times in terms of advertising revenue that has fallen dramatically and the change in the nature of the broadcasting market.  There is fairness in the sense that the public service broadcaster will bear the largest burden in the form of payment of a levy, as is right.</P>
        <P>A benefit of an industry-funded regulator is that one gets a proper, fair and independent regulation of the sector.  This is in the commercial and employment interests of everyone involved in the sector.  We knew this would be difficult.  It was flagged at various stages through<Col N="689"/>out the legislative process.  However, our experience of independent regulation funded by the industry is a positive one.</P>
        <P>I agree that this is a difficult time.  The authority has told the chief executive that there is a particular difficulty and asked him to examine the Estimate.  He is due to revert on the matter because everyone, including members of the authority, is aware of the difficult times people are facing.</P>

	<P>Deputy, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>He is responsible for taking this approach.  He set up a separate quango unnecessarily.  He could have been cost effective.  An bord snip nua pointed the way for him, but he insisted in a bull-headed way on setting up an expensive regulatory structure for which he is now penalising the independent radio sector in particular as well as others.  The Minister cannot walk away from his responsibilities.  I urge him to ensure that the secondary legislation is annulled so as that we can start again and try to put right the problem he has created.  He must bear some responsibility for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I flatly reject the Deputy&rsquo;s accusations.  I recognise that there are difficulties in the industry.  We must examine the regulatory system to ensure that it is cost effective and efficient as well as being a proper regulatory system.  There are different opinions as to how this should be done.  For example, should there be an amalgamated or separate content network regulator?  The experience of the UK, which took the combined route, is that there were no cost savings.  A single body would have the exact same functions, personnel and needs.  One cannot remove the need for proper content regulation.</P>

      </Qst><Col N="690"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Broadcasting Act 2009 requires the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, an independent regulatory authority, to provide for the development of commercial digital terrestrial television, DTT, services.  On foot of this requirement, the BAI&rsquo;s predecessor, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, launched a competition, which is still ongoing.  As the Deputy is aware, the highest placed consortium in the competition withdrew from the process last April.  Negotiations then commenced with the next placed bidder and this process is continuing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the same answer the Minister gave previously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated recently in response to a previous question on the issue, I am not prepared to speculate on the outcome of the commercial DTT process, which is a matter for the BAI.  Nor am I prepared to surmise on the ongoing negotiations between the BAI, RTE and the OneVision consortium.  I have, however, made clear my opinion that I would like to see this process concluded as soon as possible.  The conclusion of the process is essential to provide certainty for broadcasters, suppliers and the general public with regard to the development of commercial DTT services.</P>
        <P>Under section 129 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, RTE is required to ensure that free-to-air DTT is available to approximately 90% of the population on such date as may be specified by the Minister.  I signed an order last week specifying this date as being 31 October 2010.  The Act also requires RTE to provide a national free-to-air digital service with capacity to carry RTE 1, RTE 2, TG4 and TV3 by the end of 2011 or such later date as I may specify.  I have written to RTE informing it that the date for provision of a national service is 31 December 2011.</P>
        <P>My policy objective is the earliest possible switch-off of the analogue television system operated by RTENL and it is my intention that this will be no later than quarter four of 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>At least we now have some dates.  On 26 January, the House got the same answer from the Minister in terms of the process, in that he hoped it would conclude as soon as possible.  It is not encouraging for the myriad of industries that depend on a decision.  It will be almost impossible for RTE to pay for the roll-out of free-to-air DTT services unless it has a revenue stream from a commercial service using the infrastructure RTE has put in place.  Originally, they were to be paid for and used by Boxer, but that deal collapsed.  Since then, the Minister has backed a process whereby the next tender after Boxer, OneVision, would try to do a deal with RTE.  However, this has not occurred.</P>
        <P>As I asked in January, has the Minister set a timeframe with the BAI, RTE and OneVision to conclude their negotiations?  What will be the Minister&rsquo;s response if the relationship between RTE and OneVision breaks down to such an extent that a commercial proposition does not come from OneVision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are sensitivities here.  There would be difficulties if the Minister intervened in the awarding of licences.  We have learned the lesson that we should maintain a certain distance and have an independent regulatory system to organise such a competition.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not in a selection process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a contract negotiation arrangement, which is commercially sensitive.  I am dissatisfied at the long time it has taken and I want to see an outcome quickly.  We will be switching off our analogue system at the end of 2012 because the economic cost of using that spectrum for broadband is so significant that we cannot afford not to make that happen.  </P><Col N="691"/>
        <P>I agree that the preferred outcome is one where we combine a free-to-air service with a commercial platform which helps cover RTE&rsquo;s transmission costs.  This was set out in the legislation.  I do not have complete control of that process but I believe it must be decided within a maximum of three or four weeks because we are running into timelines where it starts to be difficult to meet the overall objective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We certainly are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is not possible for both parties to reach agreement we will have to look at other alternatives.  It will be up to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to do that.  If it cannot succeed the Department will work with the BAI to make it happen. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>For the first time the Minister has conceded that this process may not work out.  If that happens the Minister says the BAI will be responsible for finding a way forward.  I reject that.  This is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility.  It is his obligation to ensure that we can have analogue switch-off by the end of 2012.  He should not try to transfer responsibility to the BAI.  </P>
        <P>Is it realistic to set a date for RTE to provide free-to-air digital terrestrial television, DTT, services in the absence of an agreement on commercial DTT, given the significant funding implications of free-to-air television?  Why has the Minister decided to set a date for free-to-air DTT in the absence of an agreement, or even an understanding, of where we are in terms of commercial DTT?  He knows one is reliant on the other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do accept responsibility but my responsibility starts with letting the legislative process which has been put in place work.  That lies with the BAI.  I have supported the authority and will give it the room to do its work.  If it fails and the process cannot be worked through, it will be back to myself and the Department to find a solution; and we will find one.  While I understand Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s argument that we should try to wait for the commercial process, I wanted to make it clear and certain that, come what may, we are switching off our analogue system.  That was one of the reasons behind the decision to signal RTE to start switching on the transmission system, which is in place, at the end of October this year.  We have already spent the significant volumes needed to put in the mast and other equipment. </P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wanted to give a clear signal to the suppliers and all concerned of our determination in terms of switch-off and the move towards whichever alternative system evolves in the coming months.  </P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> if he has satisfied himself with the capacity to store gas here in the context of energy security concerns and an over reliance on imported gas from the UK. </Quest>
        <QRef>[10457/10]  </QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Security of gas supply is a fundamental priority for the Irish economy given its continued importance for power generation.  Given our high level of import dependence over the interconnectors with the UK, gas storage has an important role to play in contributing to enhanced gas security for the island of Ireland.  The report on an all-island common approach to gas storage and LNG reinforces the case for additional storage facilities.</P><Col N="692"/>
        <P>The existing commercial gas storage facility at Kinsale has the capacity to hold 198 million cubic metres.  Licensed for use by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, the facility can supply around 50% of residential and SME gas needs for up to 50 days in the event of a gas disruption.</P>
        <P>The short to medium term prognosis for the security of Ireland&rsquo;s gas supplies is relatively secure in light of the projected relative stability of the UK gas market.  Increased global gas supplies combined with reduced global demand has led to the International Energy Agency projecting a more benign world outlook for the next few years.  Nonetheless the risk of supply disruption should never be discounted and the continuing depletion of North Sea gas supplies means we will become reliant on gas supplies from more distant markets.  The impact of the Russia Ukraine dispute on a number of member states in early 2009 was a wake-up call for the EU on gas security of supply.  The key objective of the proposed EU regulation on security of gas supply is to ensure that the market meets the gas supply needs of member states including through commercial gas storage.</P>
        <P>I welcome the current market interest in developing further commercial gas storage, both in Ireland and in Northern Ireland.  My Department is working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and the energy regulators North and South on actions to enhance security of gas supply on the island including the scope for commercial gas storage.</P>
        <P>The development of the Corrib gas field would also provide a new source of gas supply which could meet up to 60% of our annual demand in its early years of operation.</P>
        <P>In addition, the interest in providing liquefied natural gas storage on a commercial basis is also an important development.  Shannon LNG has received planning permission to construct an LNG re-gasification terminal at a site located on the Shannon estuary.  This facility could potentially provide up to 40% of Ireland&rsquo;s gas.  LNG has the potential to improve Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity to the global gas market, which would be a critical factor in the event of a major supply disruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  Regardless of a number of planned projects to which the Minister has referred, Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on imported fossil fuels makes us extremely vulnerable at present.  More than 90% of the gas we use on this island is imported.  Let us not forget that 55% of all of the power generated in Ireland is now fuelled by gas.  Almost all of that comes from the UK market.</P>
        <P>At present, we have the capacity to store 11 days&rsquo; usage of gas.  This compares poorly with most European countries.  France can store 92 days&rsquo; gas needs, in Germany the figure is 84, in Italy 80 and in Denmark 58.  The average of the EU 15 member states is 52 days.  These countries are not reliant on two gas interconnectors, as we are.  Regardless of what is being developed by Shannon LNG and in the Corrib gas field, does the Minister intend to extend the remit of the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, to include gas storage and will he set a target of an increased number of days&rsquo; storage of our gas reserves?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns.  The statistics he highlights show that we need to increase our commercial storage.  The Commission for Energy Regulation has responsibility for managing storage licence conditions and it is the commission, in conjunction with the Department, which will look at the various options.  The National Oil Reserves Agency has a connection to this.  I recently had a meeting with NORA when we examined the potential for increasing storage facilities at our power plants in order to cover the risk the Deputy mentioned, that is, that in the event of a gas shortage the 55% of power generation would not <Col N="693"/>be possible.  That fuel back-up can be done in a liquefied distillate rather than gas.  The issue does not necessarily have to be one of gas storage.  This is a separate issue which largely relates to the salt deposits in Larne, the Kinsale field or some other storage facility.    We will have to look at that as part of our security system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with much of what the Minister said.  However, will he take action to require increased storage capacity rather than talk about the opportunities which exist in empty gas fields off Kinsale or in Northern Ireland or about potential storage of liquefied natural gas in places like Foynes?</P>
        <P>We need a Government decision.  We have the capacity to store 55 days of oil.  Some of this is stored outside the State, which is also a concern.  With regard to gas, we are particularly vulnerable to an accident or a shutting-off of supply, for whatever reason.  That is something for which we must prepare and on which the Government should take a stand in terms of Government policy.  Is the Minister willing to do that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  It will have to be within the confines of the European Union regulations in the area where there is a proposal for the regulation and security of gas supply.  As I said, it will be done largely with the Department and the CER working with the Commission to ensure we meet the European Union requirements as well as our own needs.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> if he will report to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the progress made regarding the creation of a one-stop-shop to market State-owned broadband infrastructure. </Quest>
        <QRef>[10458/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The establishment of a one-stop-shop is one of the commitments in the next generation broadband policy paper, Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland, which I published in June last year.  The concept of a one-stop-shop arose from a recognition that there is added value to be had from facilitating telecoms operators in gaining access to ducting in State-owned networks thereby ensuring optimal use of State assets and facilitating more cost-effective roll out of broadband.  The context of the proposal is the anticipated increase in demand for high speed broadband into the future.</P>
        <P>My Department has had consultations with the telecoms operators and has also engaged with the relevant State bodies which are generally supportive of the proposal.  My Department has also undertaken an initial survey of State-owned networks and has published a series of maps showing the routes of infrastructure such as roads, electricity, gas and rail.</P>
        <P>A further development in progressing the concept has been the publication of the Premium Rate Services Bill, which contains an amendment to the Communications (Regulation) Act 2002 whereby the National Roads Authority will provide a formal framework to make ducts on national roads and motorways accessible to telecommunications companies.  This Bill, which has cleared all Stages in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, will be back before this House tomorrow and I anticipate it will be quickly enacted.  The immediate objective is to have information on the availability of and access arrangements for all State-owned ducting via a single contact point later this year.</P>
        <P>At the same time we will evaluate and progress the best management system that will in the future provide co-ordinated access to such State-owned ducting.  Such a management system should facilitate our wider objective of promoting co-operation between different telecoms providers of backhaul and wholesale services while at the same time not undermining competition in the market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the three years I have been a Member of the House, I have heard the Minister pontificate about what he is doing in terms of broadband and set targets which he has consistently failed to meet.  To hear him say he anticipates a demand for high speed broadband is really maddening, especially if one comes from my region of the mid-west which has the highest unemployment figures in the country.</P>
        <P>When will we see developments because with almost 500,000 people unemployed, most of whom are in the mid-west, the IDA and Shannon Development have stated clearly that the most significant barrier to job creation in the mid-west is the lack of a high speed broadband system?  It is simply not there.  The networks have been in the ground for years and it is frustrating for people.  When will we see those networks connected and a one-stop-shop, the details of which have been published, so that companies can access information from a one-stop-shop?</P>
        <P>I would like a timeframe and for the Minister to state when this will happen.  He could have given this answer last September.  I do not want to listen to the same story from the Minister next September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Deputy Coonan mentioned the past three years because any independent analysis of what has happened in the past two and a half to three years since I have been in office is that broadband numbers have gone from 600,000 to 1.4 million or so.  That is a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not spin the numbers. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the reality.  However, it is not enough.  We need&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>People are buying mobile phones.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and want to go further.  We need higher speeds.  Again, it is a fact that the competition I am pursuing is delivering that.  The competition between the cable providers, the fixed line providers, the mobile providers, the WiMAX providers and the satellite providers is the best way to drive down prices and drive up speeds.  That has been shown in market after market and it is working here.</P>
        <P>The likes of the cable company investing in new cable networks will give 50 megabit download speeds.  WiMAX deployment here is ahead of any other European country.  We need those sorts of innovative solutions because of rural one-off housing levels.</P>
        <P>However, it is not enough and we need to go further.  One of the comparative advantages we have over other countries is our recently built State infrastructure where we can provide access to ducting, in particular on our road network, along our gas pipelines, along our rail tracks and along ESB wires, where it is already happening.</P>
        <P>This one-stop-shop will help progress that.  We must do it carefully and in a way that does not undermine the very competition which I have set out and which is delivering the higher speeds, lower prices and greater broadband.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not give us targets or dates and he spoke about Europe.  The National Competitiveness Council stated that broadband penetration in Ireland is the second worst in the EU for firms and small businesses.   When will the Minister start to deliver, in particular in the mid-west region and rural areas where broadband is simply not available and if it is available, it is of such poor quality that it is not able to operate next generation technology.  It is practically useless.  For the past three years, we have appealed to <Col N="695"/>the Minister time after time to do something about it.  When will we see action rather than words?  Actions speak louder than words.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In those rural areas, there is action.  There is a &euro;200 million plus scheme to provide in the best way we can to the very rural areas which, as the Deputy said, are most sensitive to this.  We have gone further than that.  We have gone to Europe where there is European Union funding available for a rural broadband scheme to get to the last 10,000 houses which will be covered by that scheme.  We deliberately set out to try to give universal coverage across this island in order that no one is left behind.</P>
        <P>At the same time, we must ramp up the speeds and let the technologies come here.  New satellite systems are being rapidly developed where speeds are a multiple of what they were a year ago.  That market-led competitive pressure is leading to new technologies and it is the best way to deliver those higher speeds.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the measures he is planning to introduce to promote bio-fuel production domestically in view of setting a bio-fuel content for petrol and diesel target of 4%. </Quest>
        <QRef>[10163/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 87 together.</P>
        <P>The national bio-fuel obligation will require suppliers of road transport fuels to ensure that 4% of their volumes sold on the Irish market is bio-fuel.  The legislative basis for the obligation is provided for in the Energy (Biofuels Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which has recently been introduced in the Oireachtas with a view to its enactment in the coming weeks and entry into force by July next.</P>
        <P>My Department calculates that in a full year, approximately 220 million litres of bio-fuels will be required to deliver the 4% target.  In 2008, the last year for which data are currently available, 85 million litres of bio-fuels entered the Irish market.  My Department currently compiles information on the origin of bio-fuels imported under the mineral oil tax relief schemes, MOTR.  Under the schemes, approximately 30% of eligible bio-fuels were produced in Ireland in 2008, with the remainder being imported.</P>
        <P>The production of bio-fuel in Ireland has been incentivised to date under the mineral oil tax relief schemes, which have resulted in 18 projects being awarded excise relief on specified volumes of bio-fuel they produce.  At least five bio-fuels plants have been constructed or redeveloped on foot of excise relief granted under the schemes.  A number of others are either at an advanced stage of planning, or have received planning permission.</P>
        <P>Prior to the introduction of the excise relief schemes in 2005, market penetration of bio-fuels in Ireland was almost non-existent.  While a figure for market penetration for 2009 is not yet available, it is expected to be in excess of 2%.  The steady growth in indigenous bio-fuel production is reflected in the fact that it represents over 50% of bio-fuel production to date.  The <Col N="696"/>excise relief schemes were designed as an interim measure to increase the level of bio-fuels in the fuel mix and to encourage the development of an indigenous bio-fuels industry in advance of the introduction of the national bio-fuel obligation.</P>
        <P>The national bio-fuel obligation will, by definition, incentivise the sustainable growth of the Irish bio-fuels market and will support indigenous bio-fuel producers and expand the sustainable indigenous production of bio-fuels.  The EU sustainability criteria will also provide competitive advantage for Irish and other EU producers by ensuring that non EU imports meet strict environmental guidelines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the forthcoming legislation.  It is common sense in terms of the percentage determined.  However, I am sure the Minister is aware there has been quite harsh criticism from the indigenous and developing bio-fuels industry that it is simply being left up to the market to determine how this will develop.  Will he accept that if he pursues the current policy, if it can be called a policy, we are in danger of simply replacing one imported fuel with another one?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Has the Minister a strategy to develop the indigenous enterprises in a coherent way?  I have no doubt the Minister, as is his wont, will make very flowery speeches about the bio-fuels sector as he does about the wind sector and other renewable sectors which are very often still stuck and underdeveloped because of a lack of a strategic approach by the Government.  I have several questions on the indigenous bio-fuels sector and sustainability.  How does the Minister intend to ensure Ireland exceeds the 30% target?  How does he propose to ensure rigorous sustainability criteria are applied to imported bio-fuels?  How will sustainability be tracked to create confidence that Ireland is not part of the problem in the developing world, particularly with regard to the effects of bio-fuel production on agriculture?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Bio-fuels are not an area in which the market can be left to its own devices as to do so would result in unsustainable fuels being imported from rainforest regions and other unsustainable sources.  This is the reason I was active and supportive of the European Union proposal for sustainability criteria to be the first requirement.  This means legislation set in Brussels rather than individual markets would be the deciding factor.  The crucial issue in this respect is that a carbon reduction requirement of 35% would exclude a whole market from exporting bio-fuels to this country.  The United States corn to ethanol market, which caused considerable damage and undermined domestic Irish production, has been stopped by the imposition of sustainability criteria. </P>
        <P>While I wish to pursue the development of an indigenous market, this must be done within the rules of the World Trade Organisation, particularly given that our agriculture sector lives by the rules of that organisation.  We cannot breach WTO rules in one area while seeking the protection of the WTO in other areas in which we may have commercial advantage.</P>
        <P>The first requirement for the development of an indigenous industry is to have a secure, stable market in Ireland.  Significant domestic supply sources, both in waste products and the agriculture sector, will have commercial viability in a more stable market.  The first requirement is to find out how this works under the European Union&rsquo;s sustainability criteria.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand Ireland can take three specific measures in conjunction with the legislation to promote the indigenous bio-fuels industry.  Different countries take different views on import tariffs, with Germany and Britain taking different approaches.  Which country&rsquo;s approach does the Minister favour?  The French have decided to ignore the issue of <Col N="697"/>import tariffs by requiring localised production of bio-fuels before they can be used in the blending process.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view of the French position?</P>
        <P>I understand it is possible to require that ethanol be of a certain quality before it can be blended.  I refer to ethanol rather than bio-diesel because the former has been the subject of more discussion.  Imposing such a quality standard would effectively preclude the use of sugar cane in the production of bioethanol.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on having such a requirement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>These are complex technical issues which are, I understand, related.  In the systems adopted by the countries to which the Deputy referred, a defining choice must be made about whether one discriminates against unrefined ethanol products versus refined products.  I understand that refined ethanol can be transported from Brazil to Europe, whereas unrefined ethanol would not survive such a long journey.  A number of European countries, of which Germany, I understand, is one, have introduced a requirement that bio-fuel imports must be non-refined.  In so doing, they have protected sources of domestic production.  My Department has met a number of those who are examining this complex and difficult issue.  A difficulty is that if a similar requirement was in place here, we would have to import bio-fuels from European sources, rather than Brazil and it is not certain that such circumstances would be better for Irish farming.</P>
        <P>While the Department is open to considering various regimes, I am reluctant to follow a particular course until the European Union publishes or establishes sustainability criteria.  It would be best to administer the system on the basis of continuing review to ensure it supports indigenous producers.  How one does this is not as clear or simple as following a German or British model.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister failed to answer my questions on two of the three issues I raised.  Irish farmers do not have a problem competing with other European countries in the area of ethanol production.  Competing with sugar cane plantations in Brazil is making life potentially impossible for them.  The Minister raised the prospect of importing unrefined ethanol from other European countries.  The Irish market is capable of competing with other European markets. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Such a scenario may not meet our common objective of giving Irish farmers a viable market supply.  If we were to go down this avenue and we ended up importing these products from Rotterdam or elsewhere, it would not be of any benefit to the Irish agricultural sector.  In that case, it would not be the correct course of action. </P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the position regarding the timeframe for setting up initiatives to analyse broadband speeds experienced by end users here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[10131/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support proposals to conduct an audit of the quality of service experienced by broadband service customers compared to the quality of service advertised by suppliers.  Ideally, this study would be conducted in a manner which would also permit international comparisons.</P>
        <P>In June 2009 the European Commission published an invitation to tender for a contract to conduct a study and prepare a report on the quality of broadband services available to <Col N="698"/>customers in the European Union.  The emphasis of this study, as proposed, was on measuring real time customer experience across the European Union compared to the speeds and other quality of service parameters advertised by broadband service providers.</P>
        <P>In January last, the European Commission announced that following a thorough assessment of the eight bids  it had received, it had decided that none provided sufficient guarantees that reliable robust data would be obtained.  The Commission therefore decided to close the tender process without awarding a contract.  In its announcement, the Commission also indicated it may recommence this procurement procedure.</P>
        <P>Following informal contacts between my Department and the European Commission on its likely plans to re-tender and the likely duration of the study after the award of any contract, which would be expected to be nine months or more, I have decided to commence a study of broadband speeds available to customers in Ireland independently of the proposed wider EU study.  My Department has commenced drafting an invitation to tender document.  The formal invitation to participate and the contract award process will accord with competitive public procurement arrangements.  I expect the tender document to be available to participating parties shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>My heart sank when I heard it would take at least nine months for the European Union to award a contract.  For this reason, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to proceed with a tender process.  The Minister indicated a tender document would be available shortly.  Will he specify exactly when he expects the proposed initiative to proceed?</P>
        <P>I presume the Minister is well aware of the serious problem we have with slow connections.  Numerous reports have pointed out that Ireland&rsquo;s broadband performance is dismal in comparison with that of other countries.  We have the highest percentage of slow Internet connections in Europe and rank fifth lowest for high speed connections.  Ireland will not be able to compete unless we get our act together on broadband speeds.</P>
        <P>The Minister should examine his own advice before developing an initiative.  Until recently, he advised Deputies to visit the website <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i> for information on operators.  If one were to do so, one would find that 75% of the listed suppliers no longer exist.  That is a shoddy performance.</P>
        <P>We must address the issue of broadband speed.  With regard to the assessment of the slow speed of broadband services in Ireland, how does the Minister propose to address this issue in parallel with ascertaining how bad the position is?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are addressing the issue through a range of measures, including investments in 100 megabit connectivity in schools, Project Kelvin, a high speed connection between North America and Ireland, and the exemplar network which creates potential to overcome the slow spot in the Internet, namely, the choke point at switching equipment.  We are making a number of investments which provide an opportunity to speed up the networks.  Before doing so, however, we must first find out what are current broadband speeds.  I expect the tendering process to award a contract for carrying out this task will take place within the next two or three weeks.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the publication of broadband speeds because I believe it will confirm recent OECD findings that Ireland is one of the fastest improving countries in the area of broadband.  I acknowledge that we are coming from behind and need to do more, but Ireland is in the top three or four OECD countries as regards catching up and becoming faster on the Internet.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="699"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>At least we finally have some acknowledgement from the Minister that there is a problem with speeds.  Every time he is questioned about broadband, he starts reeling off penetration figures.  They are impressive but all they suggest is that people want broadband.  Unfortunately, however, they have to use second-rate broadband by and large.  Deputy Kathleen Lynch&rsquo;s question concerns how we measure progress in terms of doing what is most important in broadband, which is to provide lots of bandwidth quickly so that Ireland can try to catch up with other countries that are moving ahead in this area.  As regards the State&rsquo;s broadband infrastructure, can the Minister give us a date for the one-stop-shop?  That question was already asked by Deputy Coonan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The first thing we have to do is pass the legislation tomorrow.  That is the first crucial date and, as I said in my reply, we must proceed with the one-stop-shop this year.  While I acknowledge that we have been behind, one of the primary reasons was that we had a series of ownerships in Eircom that took a short-term position, which was not investing in the networks.  It seems to me that over a number of years it was extracting as much value out of the company as possible.  I have high expectations that the new ownership, STT &mdash; which comes from a country where they have invested in very high-speed broadband and which has a telecoms company with the latest network technology there &mdash; will transfer some of that expertise and know-how into the network here to get value back on its investment.  That is a crucial development I am looking at this year in order to increase speeds.  What will incentivise it is the development by the cable network of DOCSIS 3 technology on that cable network, which will bring quicker broadband speeds to tens of thousands of houses this year and next year.  It is that competition, as well as the prospect of fourth generation mobile, Wymex, new satellite technology or evolving fixed-wireless technology, which will allow speeds to double.  They are doing so.  It is a key requirement for us to keep pushing various companies to make investments, which will see customers getting the benefit of faster speeds.  That can and will happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister ensure that companies do not get away with making misleading claims?  Companies often promise speeds up to a certain level, which is pretty meaningless because most of the time they are way below that.  The website, which is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility, is currently under construction.  Will he acknowledge, however, that it does not look good for such a website not to be up to date?  I know we are concentrating on speed, but even with a national broadband scheme 12,000 households will still not have broadband services at all.  The Minister must deal with this, so has he come up with a solution to provide those households with broadband?  If not, they will be at a great disadvantage.  It is not as if they can wait a while and expect to get broadband, because even after that scheme is completed they will not have broadband.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised the issue of open access to ducting with the Minister before and he said he was considering it.  What conclusion has he drawn as to whether we should be regulating to require open access to ductings so that people can lay fibre to deliver high bandwidth, high-speed broadband into people&rsquo;s homes and businesses?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said to Deputy Coonan earlier, that is why we went to Brussels and got EU state aid approval for a new, additional rural scheme which will require us to provide alternatives for those 12,000 houses.  </P>
        <P>We were dissatisfied with the quality of information on the website and that is why I took it down.  Companies were not providing sufficiently up-to-date information.  ComReg does <Col N="700"/>provide a website which has the same or similar information, so I am satisfied to direct people to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That is hardly open access. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Open access is the concept with the one-stop-shop.  That ducting is to provide it on an open access basis.  It is up to the regulator to try to pursue and promote open access in other key network infrastructure and that is happening.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulator needs policy guidance from the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave very clear policy guidance and in the last few weeks the outcome has been &mdash; as was raised in the last session of oral questions &mdash; that the arrangement saw a drop in line-share costs of approximately 80% to 90%.  Further decisions are being made about unbundling the network, which is happening.  The reality therefore is that companies are starting to see the wisdom of a more open access policy.  It is the way to get an economic return on difficult investments, which is what we must now see happening.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Today saw the publication of the worst ever results from Allied Irish Banks with losses of &euro;3.5 billion.  When the guarantee scheme went though the House, the <Col N="701"/>Minister for Finance said that we were now deeply embedded in the banking sector.  Conditions were laid out for recapitalisation and what its consequences might be.  It is coincidental that the amount of recapitalisation put in by the Irish taxpayer is also &euro;3.5 billion.  In the intervening period we have had no credit being loaned, no return for the taxpayer and no dividend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand this, Allied Irish Banks will come cap-in-hand to the Government for a further recapitalisation sum of between &euro;3 billion and &euro;5 billion.  When the banking crisis started, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response was to say that we would write whatever cheque was necessary.  When Allied Irish Banks come to the Government for more money, on top of what taxpayers will have to pay for toxic loans transferred to NAMA, what conditions will the Taoiseach lay down to protect Irish taxpayers?  Will he tell Allied Irish Banks that there will be no more money unless they dispose of assets that are of no value to the Irish taxpayer or will he bail out the banks and drown the next generation of taxpayers in debt?  What conditions will he lay down before he considers giving any further money to Allied Irish Banks? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister for Finance has pointed out, we are preparing a comprehensive response to all of those issues.  Today&rsquo;s issue, however, relates to the results that have arisen in AIB.  Those results show that NAMA is forcing the banks to face up to the reality of their bad loans.  Everybody knows that the banks loaned far too much to speculative property development.  NAMA is making the banks take the losses on these property loans up front.  That is what is reflected in the large losses that AIB is reporting.  Without NAMA the banks would have inevitably tried to do what Japanese banks did in the 1990s, which was to spread out the losses over the next decade to the detriment of lending to viable small businesses and households.</P>
        <P>I am glad to note that when he addressed the Committee on Finance and the Public Service earlier today, the Governor of the Central Bank said he believes NAMA and the recapitalisation of the banks will create the foundations for the recovery of banking.  It is important to point out that from the Government&rsquo;s point of view, we stand ready if necessary to provide recapitalisation to the banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Under what conditions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The indication that they are seeking to raise private capital, in the first instance through the disposal of assets or a rights issue, is an option that is available to the banking sector.  We have made it clear in our recapitalisation statements that we will be prepared, if necessary, in the interest of a viable banking sector to proceed on that basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach did not answer my question.  I asked what conditions the Government was prepared to lay down before it considered giving any further taxpayers money to Allied Irish Banks.  Is the Government prepared to make AIB dispose of overseas assets that are not of any interest to the Irish economy?  The Exchequer figures for February will be issued at 4.30 p.m. today and these will, more than likely, indicate that the Government will have to borrow a further &euro;20 billion this year.  Whatever case can be made for Allied Irish Banks, no case can be made for giving another &euro;6 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money to Anglo Irish Bank.  It is, effectively, a dead bank which will not lend any further moneys.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has said he will write whatever cheque is necessary.  Postbank is being let go although it has been providing services in every community for 200,000 customers and consumers.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the Taoiseach will come in here and say we need a further &euro;6 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money for Anglo Irish Bank.  There will be revolution on the streets if the Taoiseach does that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael Party put forward a credible and workable solution for Anglo Irish Bank.  We suggested it should be broken up into a good bank and a bad bank.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to tell the D&aacute;il and the country that he will not put one further cent of taxpayers&rsquo; money into Anglo Irish Bank unless it comes to him with a proposal to break the bank up into a good bank and bad bank?  He must do this so that those who invested in speculative fashion for return can share some of the pain and so that the Government can see to it that good loans that are prepared to work and where there is a possibility of future jobs can be protected.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The management plan from Anglo Irish Bank, which has been submitted to the European Commission, suggests, in the aftermath of the relevant loans being transferred to NAMA, setting up a self-contained bad bank within Anglo Irish Bank and providing for a new good bank.  This plan has already been submitted to the European Commission, but it remains to be seen whether it will be approved.  There is ongoing interaction on that.  Therefore, this is not a Fine Gael idea.  It is an idea that has come from the executive management of the board of Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael put forward that idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government dismissed it out of hand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been in the public domain since well before Christmas.  On the other matter, the issue then was that the bank would be nationalised, long before we nationalised it.  That would have meant plugging a large hole in the bank&rsquo;s balance sheet at that time, but the funding position for the State and the banks was very challenging at the time.  The State was paying an interest rate of more than 6% on its borrowings then, compared to 4.5% today.  That approach would have forced the State to try to borrow huge amounts of additional money at the worst possible time.  At best, that would have been a very expensive mistake for the taxpayers.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael claims it has a credible banking policy alternative.  As I said last week, Fine Gael&rsquo;s banking policy is to threaten to default.  We are somehow led to believe that threatening to default on those who provide funds to the banks will reduce the cost of funding the banks.  In other words, we say will not pay, but we want more money at a lower interest.  That is how credible Fine Gael policy is.  Its other idea is to set up a national recovery bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about paying another &euro;6 billion?  I asked what ideas the Government has.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael claims the ECB will fund the national recovery bank idea, but there is no basis upon which a bank will be funded solely from ECB funds.  Were one to seek to obtain funds and chase deposits from other banks in the system, that would clearly increase the demand on funding and increase interest rates.  Therefore, the Fine Gael proposals would create an even more difficult situation.  </P><Col N="703"/>
        <P>The Governor of the Central Bank and others have confirmed that the approach we are taking is the best possible approach.  NAMA is forcing the banks to face up to their losses and take those losses up-front.  The policy of the bank has been to indicate that asset disposal and rights issue is a possible means of raising private capital, if it is possible to do so, but obviously the State must stand ready, if necessary, to provide capital as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Some &euro;6 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Government policy on the banks is not working.  Even in the short time since we met last week, Postbank has announced it will cease operations, with a possible loss of 160 jobs, Hughes &amp; Hughes bookseller has gone into receivership, with 225 jobs lost, clothing retailers Vero Moda and associated retailers are losing 80 jobs, SIAC Butler&rsquo;s Steel is losing 55 jobs, and we do not know how many more jobs have gone from various small businesses around the country.  However, we will probably get some indication when the Government leaks the live register figures later this evening in anticipation of their publication tomorrow morning.  Meanwhile, we hear from businesses &mdash; the ICC monitor companies &mdash;  that 952 companies became insolvent last year and ISME has informed us that more than half of companies that apply for loans or overdraft facilities are refused.  What is happening is that the banks are not lending to businesses.  They are not lending.  The Government policy on banking is not working and because of that many people in the country are no longer working. </P>
        <P>We are now in the third calendar year of this recession.  It is a year since the Government announced its policy to establish NAMA.  To date, as I understand, not a single loan has been transferred to NAMA.  The Government banking policy is not working.  Last year, the Government rejected the Labour Party proposal for a temporary nationalisation of the banks.  Now it looks as though the Government will gradually nationalise the banks by default.  Does the Taoiseach have any plans to change Government policy on the banks or will we have a continuation of a policy which has resulted in little or no credit being made available to businesses and consequences for the survival of those businesses and for jobs?  Will he continue with a policy that requires taxpayers to dig deeper and deeper into their pockets to pay over thousands of millions of euros to Anglo Irish Bank, Allied Irish Banks and the other covered institutions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with Deputy Gilmore.  With regard to the job losses he mentioned, there were also 250 jobs lost in Athlone and 200 lost in Dundalk within the past week.  That aside, the core of the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to banking policy.  The Labour Party idea was to proceed with nationalisation of the banks 12 months ago and order a huge write-down of the value of the banks&rsquo; property loans.  The scale of the write-down would have been arbitrary, as the loans would not have been individually valued.  That action would have forced the State to immediately recapitalise the banks to plug the large hole that proposal would have created in the banks&rsquo; balance sheets.  The funding position for the State and banks last year was far worse than it is currently; therefore, the costs of plugging that hole would have been greater.  That would have been an expensive mistake for the country to make.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Who wrote that note?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true.  Throwing jibes is not a policy.  The cost of plugging the hole that nationalisation policy would have made, would have been significant, far greater than the interest rates we are paying now.</P>
        <P>On the question of trying to provide credit into the economy, the issue is that the purchase price of the assets, through the loans under the NAMA process, will determine the level of <Col N="704"/>losses incurred by the banks.  That loss, combined with other variables such as existing capital, profitable operations and other assets will determine the level of capital required by the financial institutions.  We have made it clear from the first recapitalisation statement that if additional capital is required, our preference is that it should be raised from private sources in the first instance; if this is not possible, the State will provide the capital.  If the State provides capital to a financial institution it will take ordinary equity in that institution.  We stand ready to provide capital if necessary, as it is essential to have a financial system that can provide credit to protect and create jobs.  That is the reason we have had recapitalisation &mdash; to protect and create jobs.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not working.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I remember the first time I raised the issue of banks with the Taoiseach.  On 25 June 2008, I stated: &ldquo;[T]he banks are closed to new businesses&rdquo;.  I said the banks appeared to be squeezing the life out of many businesses because they would not lend to them.  That was before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the introduction of the bank guarantee.  The Taoiseach stated in his reply: &ldquo;It is important to point out ... that, as the Central Bank has confirmed, the Irish banking system is well capitalised and is in a healthy state in terms of its own financial situation&rdquo;.  Three months later, we discovered that was not the case.</P>
        <P>At that time, when the Labour Party challenged the introduction of the blanket guarantee, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;[I]t is my intention to ensure the Irish taxpayer will not be held liable in any way for any deficit that might occur in the event of there being a problem in the future&rdquo;.  We have paid &euro;11 billion to the banks since the Taoiseach told us it would not cost anything, and now, apparently, we will have to pay more.  AIB and Anglo Irish Bank have lined up with the l&aacute;mh amach ar&iacute;s.  They are coming again for more capitalisation, and the Taoiseach tells us he stands ready to provide capital.  How many more times will he get it wrong before he realises the Government will need to change its position on the banks?  How many more people will lose their jobs?  How many more businesses will go to the wall?  For how much more money does the Taoiseach intend to beggar those who are at work today, their children and possibly their grandchildren to pay for a failed banking system?</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s banking policy is not working and because of this, people are out of work.  It is about time it changed tack on the banking system instead of maintaining its dogged approach and saying it was always right.  The Taoiseach told the Labour Party a year ago in the House that he would not accept the policy we were advocating at the time, which was temporary nationalisation.  That is fair enough; we can differ over policy.  However, even as recently as this morning, some fairly cautious commentators on the radio were telling us it was now inevitable that nationalisation would take place.  How much does the State have to own before one can say a bank is nationalised?</P>
        <P>It is time the Taoiseach woke up to the reality that the Government&rsquo;s banking policy is not working.  It is not working in the interests of the taxpayer, of businesses, or those who are losing their jobs, and it is time to change it.  If the Taoiseach is not prepared to accept the alternatives proposed by the Labour Party, Fine Gael or anybody else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Yes, Deputy Higgins.  The difference between our policy and that of the Labour Party is that it would have nationalised the banks 12 months ago.  The cost to the State and to banking at that time was greater than it is now and therefore the exposure to the taxpayer would have been greater.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We put forward a position &mdash; that is, the establishment of NAMA &mdash; that was not supported by the other parties.  NAMA puts banks in a better position to access funds <Col N="706"/>and provide credit to viable businesses and households because it will increase investor confidence in the banks through the removal of risky assets and improve liquidity through the exchange of illiquid assets &mdash; that is, the loans &mdash; for more liquid assets, namely bonds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not achieving that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not yet operational.  We received approval from the European Commission last Friday.</P>
        <P>There is an idea that recapitalisation is somehow unique to this country.  However, more than &euro;300 billion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Liquidity is the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will come to that, if that is the point the Deputy wishes to make.  More than &euro;300 billion has been offered in recapitalisation schemes of different types by various EU countries.</P>
        <P>The means by which we obtain liquidity is to take the illiquid assets &mdash; that is, the billions of euro worth of property and development loans &mdash; off the balance sheets of the banks, put them into NAMA and trade them for Government bonds.  This will provide the reserve liquidity that is required so that people can go on to the wholesale markets and obtain funds in the sure knowledge that the difficulties with the banks&rsquo; balance sheets have been properly priced in.  NAMA is proceeding with this and ensuring that banks face up to their losses.  The losses announced today by AIB and those of other banks are precisely because the NAMA vehicle is involved.  Were it not involved, banks would be seeking to protect their interests by spreading those losses over a longer period in order to protect shareholder interests only.  That was the experience in Japan in the 1990s.</P>
        <P>NAMA is bringing things forward.  It is providing, through the exchange of Government bonds for illiquid assets &mdash; that is, the loans &mdash; the means for banks to access funding at an affordable cost.  At the moment, banking institutions are chasing deposits.  The interest rate they are paying on those deposits is greater than the amount they are lending out.  That is not a sustainable position in the long term.  We have implemented a policy which has the support of those independent commentators who are not partisan on the issue, such as the Governor of the Central Bank.</P>
        <P>The question Deputies opposite need to answer is this: how do they propose to ensure credit is released?  We all know the banks have curtailed lending, mainly because they are finding it a challenge to obtain funds, and the reason for this is that providers of funds are reluctant to deposit their money in banks with balance sheets of questionable quality.  NAMA will remove that uncertainty and allow the banks to attract sufficient funding again.  None of the parties opposite has come up with a workable proposal to achieve that end.</P>

        <P>Justin Keating was a major public figure who, over a long life stretching from 1930 to January of this year, served the State and society in a wide variety of roles with distinction and devotion.  Educated as a veterinary scientist he first became a distinguished academic, lecturing in both Trinity College and University College Dublin, where he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Science and in later life becoming the first professor of equine science at the University of Limerick.</P>
        <P>He began a second career in 1965 when he joined the infant RT&Eacute;, where he devised and fronted the pioneering agricultural education programme &ldquo;Teilif&iacute;s Feirme&rdquo; which, due to his superb communications skills, quickly became one of the most popular programmes on television, even among urban audiences.  He in turn became the sort of national figure we now call celebrity.  This eclectic background prepared him well for his next and most distinguished career, that of a parliamentarian.</P>
        <P>A man of deep political conviction, he was a democratic socialist who in the best traditions of the Labour movement was both Irish and internationalist.  In response to an invitation to enter public life from the then leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Brendan Corish, he stood as a candidate for the Labour Party in the 1969 general election and was returned to this House from a Dublin constituency.</P>
        <P>His arrival coincided with the outbreak of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland and shortly afterwards with that of the arms crisis here in the Republic of Ireland.  During the many ensuing debates in this Chamber on Northern Ireland he immediately made his mark for the clarity of his contributions in dissecting the sectarian nature of the conflict and the force of his arguments in upholding the rule of law, a necessary requirement here at that time.</P>
        <P>In 1972 he was personally chosen by Brendan Corish to lead the Labour Party campaign in opposing Ireland&rsquo;s entry into the then European Economic Community.  He brought an intellectual robustness to the referendum debate which would otherwise have been absent and which also served this country well by refining the analysis of our vital national interests, such as agriculture.  As a direct result, our negotiating stance on the terms of entry was toughened to the benefit of Irish farmers and workers.</P>
        <P>He was returned in the 1973 general election and embarked on his fourth career, this time as a member of the national coalition Government, being appointed as Minister for Industry and Commerce and serving in that post for four years.  Nine months after his appointment the world economy was plunged into depression by the first oil shock and its disastrous social and economic effects set the political agenda for his remaining period in office.  He devised and <Col N="708"/>implemented policies to counter unprecedented inflation and to stem the flow of massive job losses arising from the collapse of international trade.  In that regard, he worked tirelessly with the IDA to attract new industry to Ireland and, despite the world depression, succeeded in securing significant quantities of inward investment.</P>
        <P>His greatest legacy, however, is undoubtedly the policy he developed on the exploitation of our oil and mineral resources whereby he succeeded in protecting the national interest while encouraging private sector engagement.  The policy framework agreed by this House on his recommendation serves as a template for the development of our national resources to this day.  His career as a Deputy ended in 1977 when he was not re-elected but he continued his parliamentary career by winning a seat in the Seanad, which he held until 1981 and by then returning to the European Parliament where, a decade earlier, he had been one of our first MEPs, a role for which he was particularly well equipped.</P>
        <P>His career as a parliamentarian ended in 1984 and he devoted the remainder of his life to a rich mix of careers which covered teaching, writing, science, the arts, crafts, agriculture, broadcasting, horse breeding, European affairs and environmental politics.  As a scientist he was one of the first to recognise the environmental threats posed by unbridled industrialisation and he again served society well via his trenchant warnings of the consequences of climate change.</P>
        <P>He had contracted a debilitating disease in mid life, which he fought with quiet courage and despite its physical effects, he remained active in public life up to his death, just one week short of his 80th birthday.  Surrounded by his wife, children, grandchildren, extended family and comrades, he was laid to rest in the snow to the strains of the &ldquo;Internationale&rdquo;.  Justin was a man of great conviction who remained loyal to his values and beliefs right up to the end, as his humanist funeral demonstrated.</P>
        <P>Justin Keating put his formidable intellect, erudition as a political philosopher, deep learning as a scientist and his unmatched skills as a communicator at the disposal of his country throughout a long life of unselfish devotion to the public good.  This House was fortunate that at a time of unparalleled crises, both nationally and internationally, economically and politically, it had such a renaissance man to serve the Irish public as a national parliamentarian, a Cabinet Minister and international statesman.  It is fitting that we pay tribute to him today and acknowledge with gratitude the singular and unique contribution he made to this State, the body politic and to our society.  On my behalf and that of the Labour Party, I extend to Barbara, David, Carla, Eilis and their families our sincerest sympathy on the death of Justin Keating.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was saddened to learn of the death of Mr. Justin Keating on New Year&rsquo;s Eve.  I welcome his family to the D&aacute;il and I am pleased to have this opportunity to say a few words about a person who made a strong and meaningful contribution to the development of our country in a variety of roles.</P>
        <P>Justin Keating passed away just a week short of his 80th birthday.  His life was full of activity and achievement in a wide variety of disciplines.  An obituary written about Mr. Keating made the point that he was a man who never really retired and he was certainly enthusiastic and active for the causes he espoused right up to his death.</P>
        <P>As a young man Justin Keating studied in University College Dublin and the University of London.  He became a respected academic and a gifted teacher, and in the 1950s he lectured in the UCD veterinary college.  In 1960 he was appointed as a senior lecturer in Trinity College.  I note from Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn&rsquo;s memoir that Mr. Keating was a voice for progressive reform in our universities in the late 1960s and inspired many people in student politics.</P><Col N="709"/>
        <P>Justin Keating had a lifelong love of learning and the values and benefit of education were to be a consistent theme throughout his public and political careers.  Much later, in the 1980s, he would serve with distinction as chairman of the National Council for Educational Awards, and he was a committed educationalist.  He had a great love of learning and this especially focused on his significant interest in our natural heritage and environment.</P>
        <P>His knowledge in this regard and his articulate nature served him well in his career as a distinguished broadcaster.  Justin served as RTE&rsquo;s head of agricultural programmes from 1965 to 1967.  This was a time when the country was experiencing significant advances in industrial policy and international investment but Ireland was still a predominantly agrarian society.  He was an award-winning broadcaster who kept people informed and was at the cutting edge of debate in a changing Ireland.  His passion for our natural environment infused his programmes and his whole philosophy on life.</P>
        <P>In preparing for these tributes I had the pleasure of reading Deputy Michael D. Higgins&rsquo;s typically eloquent and passionate remarks at Mr. Keating&rsquo;s funeral.  Deputy Higgins captured this aspect of Mr. Keating&rsquo;s life and this facet of his personality best when he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">His work as a broadcaster revealed a view of nature, of land and animals, that was one of wonder, and above all showed a respect for the symmetry of nature.  He understood the warm intimacy of life that flowed from being close to animals.  His view of nature was the very antithesis to the false rationalism of Francis Bacon who wrote &ldquo;I lead to you Nature and all Her children in bondage for your use&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As a prominent broadcaster and someone with strong and sincerely held convictions about how our country could progress, Mr. Keating was never going to be one to solely offer advice from the sidelines.  He took the decision to enter politics and was one of a number of prominent academics who joined the Labour Party at that time.  He was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the first time in 1969 and served two terms in this House.  He served a subsequent term in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and an earlier stint in the European Parliament.  He was a politician with strong ideas and definite views and he was also a man of great courtesy and integrity.</P>
        <P>Writing about Mr. Keating in the days following his death, Senator Eoghan Harris said that he was serious about politics but &ldquo;could have a royal row with you while observing the decencies of public discourse.&rdquo;  For Justin Keating, politics was never personal and he immersed himself in the cut and thrust of politics.  He debated issues to great effect and with a particular gift for oration.</P>
        <P>It is important and only fair to say he also had an abiding respect for the views of others.  He was a prominent member of Liam Cosgrave&rsquo;s Government and Justin Keating did his duty as a Minister at a difficult time for Ireland. He served as Minister for Industry and Commerce at a time when Ireland contended with problems provoked by the oil crisis.  He was a reformer and not one to be deterred by the slings and arrows of political life.  He was a strong advocate at the Cabinet table for protecting and developing our natural and national resources.  He also made a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s industrial development and expansion.</P>
        <P>Former Taoiseach John Bruton, who served as his parliamentary secretary in that Government, said that Justin Keating&rsquo;s work as Minister for Industry and Commerce laid the foundation in difficult times for Ireland&rsquo;s subsequent modernisation through overseas investment.  It must be said that Justin Keating did play his part.  He rolled up his sleeves during tough times for our country and got on with his job.  Despite the economic difficulties of the day, he persevered with the policies of pursuing foreign investment and free trade, which in time reaped a significant benefit to our national life.  As Minister, he led numerous trade delegations and put this vital work for the country above his own political interests.  In the month before the <Col N="710"/>1977 general election, he undertook a 19 day world tour promoting Irish businesses, which entailed 30,000 miles of travel.  He came home and went straight into the demands of a difficult and competitive election campaign.</P>
        <P>Beyond politics, Justin&rsquo;s life was no less productive and active.  He was prominent in the National Union of Journalists and wrote a column in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  He returned to broadcasting and remained in tune with academic and scientific developments.  He farmed in his beloved Kildare and he remained immersed in culture and the arts.  He was never far from the public sphere and he chaired the Crafts Council of Ireland and in later years, the Irish Humanist Association.</P>
        <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express my condolences to our colleagues in the Labour Party, and especially to those who knew Justin best and loved him most; his wife Barbara, his children Carla, Eilis and David, his grandchildren Wendy, Danielle, Jonah, Jonathan and Se&aacute;n, his great-grandchildren and all of his family.  Each of you can take great pride in Justin&rsquo;s life, which was one of service and achievement, and was fulfilled with great energy.  He was an inspiration to many, and he is fondly remembered by people throughout Ireland.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom cuidi&uacute; leis an r&uacute;n comhbhr&oacute;n ar bh&aacute;s Justin Keating.  He was a man of presence, influence, intellectual capacity and understanding.  I served with him in this House from 1975 until 1977.  I saw him on many days when he walked down those stairs and sat in the seat occupied by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  In fact, he was in this Chamber for month after month dealing with the issue of Bula and Tara Mines.  Question Time lasted for weeks in those days because Ministers dealt with all questions.</P>
        <P>Justin Keating had a power, a presence and a communications capacity that few have ever equalled in this Chamber since.  Anybody going on deputations to that Minister had better be informed, because they were dealing with a scientist, with somebody who lectured in veterinary anatomy, who knew his brief and who was not prepared to hide behind the counter or the newspaper when defending his beliefs.</P>
        <P>I saw him canvassing in the wilds of the west as a member of the national coalition for my own by-election, along with Conor Cruise O&rsquo;Brien, Brendan Corish and all the other members of the Labour Party.  In Belmullet or in Ballinrobe, he held farmers enthralled because they expected that somebody of the academic brilliance of a newly acquired member of the Labour Party would not understand the difficulties with which small farmers in the west had to contend.  As somebody who lectured veterinary anatomy, he knew the changing face of nature, or as Deputy Higgins pointed out, the changing colours of the fields and the hedgerows.  It was an election in which the party had little chance of making it, as Deputy Higgins admitted, even though it put up a great fight at the time.</P>
        <P>Justin Keating&rsquo;s life and his philosophy was crystallised by Barbara when she said that he used to say, &ldquo;If you show me better, then I must change&rdquo;.  He was never afraid to change, but he always defended his deep rooted belief in his principles.  It was a privilege to have known Justin Keating.  I remember going on the odd delegation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to speak about industrial expansion or whatever, and I remember him behind the desk dealing in an understanding way with people whose case might not be that clear, always pointing out a way forward.</P>
        <P>He was the son of Se&aacute;n Keating, and the Taoiseach and Deputy Gilmore outlined his history.  I remember him as a person of big presence and influence, but as a person who understood the ways of human nature and who translated that into politics.  It was difficult for a person of academic stature to do that in the way he did.  It was a privilege to have known him and despite <Col N="711"/>a difference with many of his political beliefs, it was wonderful to see him in action.  He had a particular belief in the payment of royalties to the people for the nation&rsquo;s natural resources, which should be used for their benefit.</P>
        <P>Here was a man who made a difference.  Here was a man who stood out and was proud to make that difference.  Here was a man who defended what politics was all about.  We often listen to commentators today who say it should be all about legislators, and the late Justin Keating made it all about legislators.  He paid the price for that, but he made no bones about standing for his duty and responsibility to put legislation through this House.  It may have been to the detriment of some of his constituents, but they make their own choice in any event.  He was quite fixed on his responsibility as an elected Member and as a Cabinet Minister to ensure that legislation was dealt with fully, comprehensively and thoroughly.  If I recall correctly, that Bula Bill was before this House for two years, and he was in here week after week doggedly pursuing his own agenda for the Bill.</P>
        <P>For me, &ldquo;If you show me better, I must change&rdquo; was the philosophy of Justin Keating.  He was a person, a citizen and a politician who made a difference, and I was proud to have known him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a great pleasure to add my voice to these tributes to a very special man, Justin Keating.  He was an idealist and an activist for all of his almost 80 years, which took him through a great variety of careers and interests.  He was a distinguished Member of this House and the Seanad.  He was a veterinarian, an enthusiastic academic and educator, a talented Minister, a courageous campaigner for many causes, a ground-breaking journalist, a farmer, a cook, an artist and much more besides.  It is no surprise at all that he never retired, and many people were astonished to learn that he battled serious illness for much of his adult life.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On behalf of the Green Party, I salute Justin Keating today as an environmentalist who gloried in the natural world and was always very passionate about the need to respect and protect the environment.  He saw no contradiction between industrial development or efficient farming and respect for the world around us.  He was keen to keep his footprint on this earth as light as possible, yet he enjoyed life to the full, in good company whenever he could find it.  Justin Keating championed what was then called the electronic cottage, and was among the first to support the idea of people being able to live in rural places and work from their own homes.  In this and many other areas, he was indeed ahead of his time.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">I wish to offer my heartfelt sympathy, and that of all members of the Green Party, to Justin Keating&rsquo;s family, relatives and friends, both here and across the globe.

	<P>On my behalf and on behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad I extend deepest sympathy to the family and friends of the late Justin Keating.  I also extend sympathy to the Labour Party, of which he was a leading member and for which he served as Minister for Industry and Commerce between 1973 and 1977.  In that role, he set out terms for oil and gas exploration off our coasts that were far more favourable for the Irish people than the sell-outs which occurred subsequently and the negative consequences of which still reverberate.</P>
        <P>During the Oireachtas hearings on the Barron report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of May 1974, Justin Keating spoke frankly of the role of the then coalition Government and supported the call for a judicial inquiry.  It is correct that we should also recall at this time the recent passing of Mr. Justice Henry Barron, the author of that report.</P><Col N="712"/>
        <P>When his book <i>The God Squad</i> was published in 1988, abuse survivor and author Paddy Doyle praised Justin Keating as the only politician who wrote and spoke about child abuse.  I never had the privilege to meet Justin Keating, who was a Deputy from a previous era.  However, his reputation and legacy have carried on.  He was independent minded and challenged preconceived ideas.  Justin Keating was widely recognised as a man of keen intellect and sincere commitment to public service.

Yesterday, 50 elderly patients who attend the day-care facility at the Plunkett Home in Boyle were informed that the services on offer there would not be continued due to a lack of staff and budgetary cutbacks.  This facility provided hope, friendship and respect for elderly citizens who made huge sacrifices for this country.  The decision that has been made is a crime against elderly citizens who rely on the service to ease their burdens and add some joy to their lives.

	<P>Does the Government propose to allocate time for a debate on the implications of Statutory Instrument No. 7 of 2010?  Deputies McManus and Coveney have an interest in this matter.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has submitted a claim for an increased levy and this will have a devastating effect and impact on employment in local radio stations.  There is no objection to such stations paying a levy.  However, there is serious controversy regarding the extent of what is proposed, namely, an increase of approximately &euro;7.6 million this year.  It would be appropriate if the implications of this statutory instrument, which has been published, were discussed on Government time.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Government Chief Whip to give consideration to this matter.</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned about the difficulties experienced by public representatives and members of the public as a result of the go-slow involving elements within the public service?  I am not raising this matter in the context of the elected representatives in this House.  Rather, I am concerned with regard to people who may, for example, want to report children who may be vulnerable or at risk but who cannot do so in certain circumstances because there is no response available from the HSE.  Will the Taoiseach report to the House on the arrangements he is making or on the efforts that are being made to restore the public services which people have a right to demand and which they have come to expect?</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to an issue that has been raised by Deputy Creed on a number of occasions.  Statements were taken in the House on the lost at sea scheme.  However, it is necessary to send this matter back to the relevant committee for further analysis.  The Ombudsman has made the point that the Government weighed her report against the rights of Deputy Fahey.  Obviously, the Government came out in the Deputy&rsquo;s favour.  Will the Taoiseach instruct the Government Chief Whip to ensure that the relevant committee engages in a further analysis of the implications of the lost at sea scheme?  It would be in everyone&rsquo;s interests, including those of Deputy Fahey, that those involved should be given the opportunity to pose questions and provide answers before the relevant committee.  I ask that the Taoiseach make arrangements in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first issue to which Deputy Kenny referred, there is a motion in my name on the Order Paper which relates to secondary legislation.  There is time for the secondary legislation &mdash; that is, the statutory instrument &mdash; to which Deputy Kenny referred to be annulled.  The reason there has been such a significant increase in the budget of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is as a result of Government policy, which ran contrary to the proposal contained in the bord snip nua report to the effect that there should be one regulator for the broadcasting and communications industries.  However, the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, insisted on establishing a new quango, namely, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  The budget for that authority has now climbed to &euro;7.6 million.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach is aware of this, although I am sure, like every other representative in the House, he has a certain dependence on local radio to transmit his views and opinions.  Local radio stations throughout the country are extremely concerned and angry at the fact that an undue burden is being levied on them.  This will lead to job losses in an essential part of our broadcasting sector.  I am sure the Minister received the same type of submissions as I did from every part of Ireland, including the south-east, Munster, Dublin, the midlands and Connaught-Ulster.</P>

        <P>With regard to the industrial relations issue, I stated to the House last week that there are well-established channels of communication with representatives of the trade unions in the public service that can be used to establish whether a basis for engagement can be identified.  We have always stood ready and available to engage.  There is a shared view on the changes throughout the public service that would produce greater efficiency, better services for the public and more satisfactory working conditions for public servants.  It is through engagement on that agenda rather than industrial action that the issues of concern to public servants can be addressed.  We have asked people to reflect on the extent to which conflict will get in the way of our shared ambitions for the public service and the well-being of individual public servants.  We are available in that respect to do that.</P>

What she does in those circumstances is to refer the issue to the Oireachtas, effectively for us to adjudicate on it.  The House has not adjudicated on it; a set of statements were made.  We need to bring it to a conclusion.

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the whereabouts of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  We spent 18 days on Committee Stage with it.  If I understand it correctly from something that was said at a recent Whips meeting, which might be inaccurate, the Minister is contemplating some 700 amendments.  I do not know if that is true, but if it is the case and it is contemplated that we would have 700 amendments on Report Stage then we would be better off having an immigration (No. 2) Bill.  We have already spent 18 days in committee and that is not the way to go about things.  I am willing to let the Minister brief the Taoiseach rather than to ask him more questions on it but that is hardly the way to enact legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Rabbitte indicated, this is a complex area.  A significant number of amendments are envisaged on Report Stage.  I presume they arise from the debate on Second Stage and Committee Stage in terms of ensuring the legislation is robust enough to achieve its objectives.  I understand the preparation of those amendments is close to finality.  I acknowledge there may well be a significant number of amendments involved but sometimes when a valid point is raised it can have the effect of requiring ten similar repeat-type amendments to a Bill.  The amendments arise from the debate on the Bill.  It is good to see that the Minister intends to respond in kind to the points that were raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do know what the Taoiseach means but I wonder whether he has ever been involved with a Bill that had 700 amendments on Report Stage.  It is not the way to make law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the amendments is to improve the Bill.  I cannot give any more detail to the Deputy than that.  The Bill needs to be enacted.  Points were raised during the debate and it is right that they have to be responded to by ensuring that the legislative framework reflects the validity of the arguments raised by both sides.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, you might perhaps give me some guidance on the matter I wish to raise.  The Irish Thalidomide Association has been in contact with the Minister for Health and Children and, through her, referral to the State Claims Agency for three years trying to get some redress similar to what has occurred in Northern Ireland, the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and in the House of Commons at Westminster. </P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, came to the House on Thursday last &mdash; she might not necessarily have been aware of the background to this situation &mdash; and she read into the record of the House the following: &ldquo;The State Claims Agency met with representatives of the association on 25 June last year and listened carefully to its position&rdquo;.  That is simply not true.  I seek your guidance, a Cheann Comhairle, and that of the Taoiseach, in terms of offering an opportunity for the record to be set straight.  That has not been the experience of the association.  It has been met with marked silence from various Government agencies in total contrast to what has happened across the water and in the North.</P>
        <P>We are talking about 32 survivors, most of whom are now in their 50s and who have long since exceeded their original expected lifespan.  Can the record of this House be corrected and can we avoid further shame on this Administration and on this Republic in terms of how we deal with those 32 citizens who have been ignored by the self-same State Claims Agency?  Up to 12 e-mails have been sent to the chief executive of that body since 25 June and they have not been responded to.  The only contact the association has received has been since this matter went public in other administrations.  We are being shamed into living up to our responsibilities.  I ask the Taoiseach to take this matter in hand, as his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children is incapable of dealing with it.</P>

	<P>The recently enacted Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 provided for a change to the upward-only rent reviews that were in place until that time.  The Taoiseach is well aware that the legislation is not retrospective on the basis of legal advice which I believe came from the Attorney General.  A letter in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> by Professor David Gwynn Morgan, who is one of two of the foremost constitutional lawyers in the country, questions that legal advice.  He says it is not unconstitutional to retrospectively address the issue of upward-only rent reviews.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that the Grafton Street Tenants&rsquo; Association met yesterday morning and it is pleading with the Government to address this issue.

    <Title>Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 <?oasys _cf1- ?>[<?oasys _cf2- ?>Seanad<?oasys _cf1- ?>]<?oasys _cf3- ?>: Second Stage (Resumed). </Title>
        <P>Question again proposed:  &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with reluctance that I feel obliged to begin on a slightly critical note, but I believe the legislation, especially in light of its source, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, is a sham.  I do not wish to personalise this but the introduction of a Bill such as this is pathetic emanating from a Deputy who spent all of his time in opposition criticising and highlighting the democratic deficit, lamenting the progressive <Col N="719"/>centralisation of power with Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers and pleading for a meaningful devolved form of local government.  It speaks volumes about the ineptitude of the Green Party in Government and its inability to influence any sort of meaningful change in terms of local government, in particular, planning.</P>
        <P>The Bill flies in the face of subsidiarity.  The word &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo; came up a lot in recent campaigns on European referenda.  It does not mean much to people but it does mean a great deal in terms of its practical application.  Subsidiarity is a commendable and worthwhile principle which we should apply to local government.  It is about governing at the very lowest level closest to the people.  Surely that is what local government should be about.  Instead, what the Bill promotes is more of a top-down approach and even further centralisation of power in terms of planning than we have seen to date.  As a former member of a local authority, I consider this lamentable.</P>
        <P>The Bill essentially amounts to watering down the powers afforded to councillors in regard to planning.  Local authority members throughout the State who are members of my party have condemned the legislation, and I am also aware of similar condemnation from councillors who are members of parties on the other side of the House.  It has been met with general disdain from public representatives who see it for what it is, namely, a whitewash designed to limit further the already limited powers available to them.</P>
        <P>Councillors have only one meaningful reserved function, that is, the creation and application of county and city development plans.  That is their main function and this Bill proposes to alter it fundamentally.  The requirement for a two thirds majority to pass a development plan or any alteration thereto flies in the face of the principle of subsidiarity.  Last year&rsquo;s local elections saw the establishment of Fine Gael-led power-sharing arrangements in the vast majority of local authorities throughout the State.</P>
        <P>This leads one to question whether the motivation behind this new two thirds majority requirement is the discomfort of the parties in government that they no longer control local authorities.  Are they trying to force a situation whereby Fine Gael councillors who have a direct mandate from the electorate will have to go on bended knee, begging for the imprimatur of Fianna F&aacute;il councillors and other councillors to agree to development plans and variations thereto and other major planning decisions?  This represents a serious abuse of the democratic system at local level and an abuse of the role of this House, being an attempt to gain political weight at local government level by parties that were defeated in last year&rsquo;s local elections.  The Government, particularly the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, must think twice about its motivation.</P>
        <P>This Bill is another example of the continuing extension of ministerial powers.  It is extraordinary that while the Government alludes to the need for local government reform that will make it more meaningful and will empower councillors to govern at local level, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government takes it upon himself to create vast new powers allowing him to direct local authorities in one direction or another.  It may well be the case that the Minister considers himself the tsar of planning and that it is only his opinion that counts when it comes to good planning.  I have news for him, however.  He should bear in mind that he is not a member of a local authority; he does not have a mandate at local level to deal with planning matters and he ought to show a certain degree of deference and respect for those who have such a mandate.</P>
        <P>Under this legislation, the Minister has bestowed upon himself the power to issue directions in regard to local area plans.  It is a bizarre notion that he should issue directions and directives from his office in Dublin on how local area plans should operate in towns and villages throughout the State.  That represents a complete diminution of the powers and responsibilities of local <Col N="720"/>councillors to represent their local areas as best they can.  What on earth qualifies the Minister to know more about a town in south Kerry or north-west Donegal than those who are elected directly to represent it?  This extraordinary premise contradicts everything the Minister, Deputy Gormley, claimed to stand for before the last general election.  It is a worrying trend.</P>
        <P>The Minister also envisages in this legislation an enhanced role for regional authorities, which are entirely exempt from any requirements in regard to public consultation.  Yet again, another layer of bureaucracy is being added that distances local representatives from their rightful functions.  Regional authorities, which are not directly elected and have no particular role, will now be in a position to direct the policies of local authorities.  I understand the Minister, in other proposed legislation, is planning to scrap the Dublin Regional Authority.  However, for the purposes of argument, I will presume it continues to exist.  Under this legislation, the Dublin Regional Authority will direct Dublin City Council as to the policies it ought to pursue in regard to the city development plan.  This is a ridiculous and extraordinary proposal of the Minister, Deputy Gormley.</P>
        <P>Similarly, an enhanced role is envisaged for the national spatial strategy.  This was originally a good document which was entirely thrown out in the mad grab for seats and votes before the last general election, when the Government decided, under the direction and stewardship of the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, to pursue a policy of decentralisation.  The national spatial strategy was completely ignored when it came down to the brass tacks of securing votes for Fianna F&aacute;il candidates in constituencies throughout the State.  Nevertheless, the spatial strategy remains a useful document, albeit one that is now most likely out of date.  This strategic policy was not laid before the Oireachtas and does not have a mandate from the national Parliament.  To propose that it should supersede the views of directly elected local councillors and the authorities on which they sit flies in the face of any concept of democracy.  I take great exception to that proposal.  The national spatial strategy should be reviewed and updated.  If it is to have a place in this legislation and if it is to function as a steward for local authorities, then it should, at the very least, be debated in this Chamber and receive a mandate from the House.</P>
        <P>Another notable element of the legislation is a sense of what can only be described as skewed priorities on the part of the Minister and his officials.  The mandatory objectives envisaged under the legislation include the promotion of sustainable settlement and transportation strategies.  That is meritorious.  However, it is bizarre that the list includes nothing about educational needs, community needs, school requirements and so on.  This has been a deficiency of the planning system for far too long.  In my constituency, a major development took place some years ago on the grounds of a former convent at Mount St. Anne&rsquo;s in Milltown.  This site formerly included a primary school which served the children of families in the area.  What was allowed to happen under our wonderful planning system?  It allowed for closure of the school, selling off and rezoning of the land and the development of multiple family-sized units on the land but with no school.  There is no school for the children of that parish to attend and consequently the parents there are forced to try to get their children into schools in neighbouring parishes that already are oversubscribed and in which there are no places.  Incidentally, according to the lists maintained by the Department of Education and Science of areas that are prioritised for school building, the area in question does not feature because it is located in Dublin 6, which is perceived to be wealthy.  It therefore does not matter and does not qualify as a priority for the Department&rsquo;s experts, which I consider to be most bizarre.</P>
        <P>Another failing of this legislation relates to over-reliance on development levies.  Theoretically, development levies are a reasonably good concept and all Members will be familiar with <Col N="721"/>examples in which they have fed into the seriously depleted coffers of local authorities.  However, in my experience in Dublin, there has been over-reliance on development levies in recent years.  The local government fund has not increased in line with either inflation or with the Government commitments made on its initial introduction.  Consequently, it has been depleted proportionately every year and local authorities&rsquo; reliance on development levies has increased.  This has provided a great incentive for local authorities to build intensively and to grant planning permission for any application that comes before them.  They are reliant on development levies for day-to-day activities at local authority level.  I can understand the conflict that exists because they are completely incentivised to grant planning permission for any application that comes before them.  This is damaging to the operation of local authorities.  It skews their priorities and the manner in which they apply development plans.  Moreover, it skews the manner in which they critically analyse and assess planning applications that come before them.  Not only does this legislation do nothing to improve this state of affairs but it refers to supplementary development contributions, which will add a greater incentive to grant inappropriate planning permission.  This issue must be considered and reviewed by the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  I would be very surprised were he able to genuinely stand over this or if he could in good conscience consider this to be a suitable way to fund local government.</P>
        <P>The issue of how local government is to be funded in the future, which is connected but not directly relevant to this Bill, must be examined.  The expectation that central government should fund local government cannot continue as it is neither viable nor sustainable.  Moreover, Members are aware that the Government does not ring-fence for local government what it should or what it has committed to do and as a result, local authorities nationwide are on the brink of bankruptcy.  A meaningful way to fund local government must be found and it will involve the introduction of local taxes.  I acknowledge this is not a politically popular thing to do or say.  Moreover, I am unsure how many Members of this House would be sufficiently courageous to stand over such a proposal but I genuinely believe it is the only way.  It is the only answer to servicing properly those needs that are met by the services provided by local government.  It is the only fair and right way to fund the requisite services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On cleaning up the planning process, earlier I alluded to the attempt to water down the role of councillors at a local level, planning being the only area in which they really have a role to play.  It is important to note that by and large, 99.9% of councillors are good people who put their names on the ballot paper and put their heads above the parapet.  They do so to try to serve their communities as best they can.  I am not aware of any councillors with whom I ever served who were corrupt or who engaged in any form of corrupt behaviour.  Dublin City Council never really had a reputation or much of an involvement in this regard as inappropriate rezoning pertained more to the county than to the city of Dublin.  However, the spotlight now is on all public representatives and specifically on councillors in respect of planning, rezoning, corruption and so on.  In the present climate, given all the tribunals and so on that have been held, it would be very difficult to abuse that system and anyone who might be so inclined probably would not get away with it.  Consequently, most local authorities nationwide have responsible councillors who are doing their best to serve the people.</P>
        <P>The apparent suspicion that exists in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in its relationship with such councillors must be reassessed.  It is important that this relationship should be restored and improved because were the only solution to planning problems to be an attempt by that Department to take back more and more power for itself and to centralise matters even further, it would lead to a far more corrupt system than existed in the past.  If one is serious about accountability and democracy, government must operate at the lowest possible level.  One must trust councillors and allow them to run local authorities in the way they should be run.  They are the people with the mandate.</P><Col N="722"/>
        <P>If the Minister is serious about cleaning up planning, he should impose penalties on local authorities that breach development plans.  This is a different point of view because in my experience, it is the planners and not the councillors who flout regulations and rules and nothing in this Bill attempts to address this point.  My experience in my constituency was that councillors had their arms twisted behind their backs to try to force them to rezone a site in Ballsbridge with which some Members may be familiar.  I am pleased and proud to state that I was one of those who led the charge against this because I did not believe it was appropriate.  I had a mandate from the people and believed it was my duty to honour it.  Consequently, the councillors refused to rezone the site and retained its residential zoning.  However, although the planners then decided to ignore the development plan, there were no consequences for the planning officials in Dublin City Council who deliberately flouted the city development plan.  This legislation should aim at and target the flagrant abuse by local authorities of development plans, planning regulations and guidelines.  The Minister is misguided in that this legislation is directed at punishing councillors who have a mandate and who are accountable to the people.  Instead, it should be directed at local authorities that try to ignore the democratically-elected councillors and try to ignore the development plans they have put in place.</P>

	<P>I welcome the legislation and am glad to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate.  The predominant purpose of my contribution is to call on the Minister to consider amending the legislation.  While I am open to correction, I understand the legislation includes a provision to allow a five-year extension to some planning permission that may run out of time.  I greatly welcome this provision and perceive the logic and reason behind it.  However, the legislation is lacking in that I understand this provision pertains to development <i>per se</i> as against one-off housing.</P>
        <P>I call for consistency, and will revert to that later in my contribution, and for fairness.  While I am open to correction, I understand that a developer or contractor will be allowed to extend planning permission beyond the five-year period for which it was granted because of the present economic climate and perhaps because the individual in question is unable to secure the requisite finance to put in place the development.  However, a couple who obtained planning permission to build a one-off house, fell on difficult times and lost their jobs through no fault of theirs might have gone to a bank for a mortgage and been refused.  To be consistent and in the interests of fairness, we should ensure that we follow through for those people to whom I referred.  Is a small builder who has bought one or two sites in the countryside and built two or three houses catered for in the legislation?  If so, I welcome the provision, as we would have consistency and fairness.  If it is not the case, I ask that the matter be examined.</P>
        <P>I represent rural County Limerick and much of my constituency work involves constituents approaching me for assistance with planning applications across a range of areas.  When dealing with planning applications, I always call for consistency.  I want to see consistency in the planning decisions that are being made daily in my county.  If I sit down with a planner or director of services and he or she can justify the reason for refusing a planning application, I accept it.  There are genuine reasons for refusals.  What I cannot accept, however, is a lack of consistency.  I do not mean a lack in one local authority area, but throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Take the infamous section 47 that landowners are asked to sign as an example.  Before entering the Chamber this evening, I spoke with two colleagues and told them that, in County <Col N="723"/>Limerick, section 47 is for life, not only for the landowner who commits to not allowing further development, but for the next landowner and the landowner after that.  I understand that in County Kerry across the border from my constituency, a section 47 is signed for a ten-year period.  In County Clare, another adjoining county, a section 47 is signed for a five-year period.  This is just one example of a large inconsistency between three counties in my immediate area.</P>
        <P>For the benefit of members of the general public who may not understand what a section 47 is, it is where a landowner has been asked to sign off on his or her landholding and given a commitment in writing that he or she will not seek further planning permission for development.  In some instances, this favours the landowner.  In the absence of the agreement, he or she would not get any planning permission.  However, there is a distinct lack of consistency and I question the legality of such a document.  Would it stand up in a court of law?  Asking anyone to sign off on a section 47 is a considerable undertaking.</P>
        <P>I mentioned one-off housing in rural Ireland.  There is a distinct train of thought, particularly in the Irish Planning Institute, that there should be fewer one-off houses.  I am a strong advocate of rural housing and allowing rural people who need to live in rural areas &mdash; I qualify what I am saying &mdash; to build in those areas.  This is important.  Although the institute and others are trying to convince us to build in towns and villages, we have a problem, as towns and villages do not have sufficient infrastructure.  I could cite several instances in my county in which applications were made to the Department over a number of years.  These applications had been prioritised by the local authority and sent to the Department, which prioritised and approved by them.  Since there was no work-to-rule or no go slow, I cannot understand why it would take five, seven or ten years for those projects to come to fruition.  The upgrading of a sewage plant in a small town is an example.  What are we doing?  We can build a motorway or whatever we wish, but we cannot seem to get to grips with doing this.  I am not referring to present incumbents, as this system has been in place for years.</P>
        <P>If I table a parliamentary question about a particular sewerage scheme upgrade, the reply will tell me that the Department has reverted to the county council for more information.  When I speak with the director of services, I am told that the council has reverted to the Department for more information.  The matter is up and down the road every second day and we get nowhere.  I cannot defend this situation because it is not on.  In this day and age, it should not be the case.  It is leaving me in a difficult situation.</P>
        <P>In my home town of Drumcollogher, there is an embargo on houses being built because the sewerage system has reached its capacity.  I accept this, as I do not want to promote pollution or cause people difficulties.  However, I want to see progress in my town and progress and growth in the rest of the towns in County Limerick.  We are being strangled in this regard because the infrastructure is not in place.  Resources and money have been made available, but no progress has been made.  I have a bee in my bonnet about this issue, which I take seriously.  We are telling people that they cannot build one-off houses in rural Ireland because county development plans specify A, B and C and that we want them to come into towns and villages.  However, those who want to build in towns and villages cannot do so.  Obviously, we must solve this problem quickly.  It is not rocket science.  We should allow people to build.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the issue of pre-planning meetings, an inclusion in our system that I welcome.  In County Limerick, our pre-planning system is effective.  The applicant can sit down rationally with the planner for the area, discuss the issues and get a note containing an accurate account of the meeting from the planner when leaving.  This allows the applicant to know where he or she stands, whether he or she can apply for permission to build a type of house, whether permission will be given, the percolation situation and so on.  This is reasonable and proper <Col N="724"/>and prevents people from throwing away good money, as they can be advised.  The pre-planning process is welcome and works well for us.</P>
        <P>Planning can be subjective and design is a bugbear for many people who want to build houses.  Not for one moment would I advocate the so-called build what you like where you like syndrome.  This cannot happen and I do not agree with it.  If two people are making a decision to build what will, in most cases, be their family home for the rest of their lives, we are quick in telling them that they cannot build a two-storey or dormer house somewhere.</P>

What was the flavour of the month yesterday might not be the flavour of the month today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrickFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009, which seeks to introduce a number of changes to planning and development.  The key objectives of the Bill are to support economic renewal and promote sustainable development.  It also aims to bring about a closer alignment between the national spatial strategy, regional planning guidelines, development plans and local area plans in addition to introducing a requirement for an evidence-based core strategy in development plans.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Ireland&rsquo;s planning system was first introduced on 1 October 1964 when the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1963 came into effect.  Since then, a large body of planning legislation and regulations have emerged, which is said to reflect &ldquo;the expansion of the statutory development control system to meet the demands arising from economic growth, rising public concern in the area of environmental control, a desire on the part of the public for a statutory and independent planning appeals system, and a growing European dimension arising from our membership of the European Union&rdquo;.  Expansion of the planning code culminated in the Planning and Development Act 2000, which the Department describes as the starting point for the modern planning code.</P>
      
        <P>In the regulatory impact analysis of the Bill, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government highlights a number of what it describes as qualitative improvements in the planning system in recent years.  These include the consolidation and modernisation of the planning code under the Planning and Development Act 2000; the publication of the national spatial strategy in 2002 and the regional planning guidelines adopted in 2004; the enactment of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, which provides a single, consent process for major private and public infrastructure projects; and the provision of comprehensive guidance to local authorities in regard to, <i>inter alia</i>, development plan preparation, the development management process, strategic environmental assessment, rural housing, retail planning, apartment design and space standards, the planning system and sustainable urban residential development.  In brief, since the consolidation and modernisation of planning laws in 2000, there have been numerous amendments to the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P><Col N="725"/>
        <P>The Planning and Development Act 2002 amended Part V of the 2000 Act in regard to social and affordable housing to provide more flexibility for the manner in which developers can comply with obligations under Part V of the Act.  A number of miscellaneous amendments were made, for example in regard to local area plans, development plans and judicial review of compulsory purchase orders.  The Housing Act 2004 provided for the opening up of the affordable housing market to financial institutions.  The Planning and Development Act 2006 made substantial changes to the 2000 Act, most significantly in introducing a special application process for strategic infrastructure developments, whereby applications are made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Further amendments included modifications to the procedure for the refusal of planning permission for past failures to comply and changes to special judicial review proceedings to cover &ldquo;any act done&rdquo; by the planning authority or the board.  Finally, Part V of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 amended the 2000 Act to provide for consistency between the Dublin Transport Authority&rsquo;s transport strategy and the plans and guidelines of planning authorities within the greater Dublin area.   It set out a role for the Dublin Transport Authority in land use and planning in the greater Dublin area.  The Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009 proposes to provide for a consultative role for the National Transport Authority in the preparation of regional planning guidelines, similar to that already provided for the Dublin Transport Authority.  This is most welcome.</P>
        <P>Local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are responsible for directly operating Ireland&rsquo;s physical planning system. According to the Department, its primary role is &ldquo;to provide the essential legislative framework and policy guidelines while seeking to minimise the regulatory burden and cost of the system&rdquo;.  Basing planning on population targets has the potential to disadvantage rural communities along with many smaller towns and villages.  Parts of my constituency of North Kildare, along with north Offaly, were designated disadvantages under Offaly and Kildare Partnership.  Sustaining these communities and encouraging people and business to the areas has been problematic.  Besides, Kildare borders the BMW region and this puts my constituency at a disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Using population targets will not get commercial or housing development in the smaller villages, due to the size of development that will be allowable under population targets.  Small development will not be viable, as developers have to provide infrastructure, such as water, sewerage, footpaths and traffic calming for the entire village.</P>
        <P>Residents in these areas need improved infrastructure and the only way this can be achieved is by the introduction of appropriate developments.  I hear much talk about gateways and hubs and encouraging population growth in these towns. None of these towns are in Kildare.  Apart from the large towns, minimum rural housing will be allowed and this will further disadvantage rural communities, particularly farm families and those involved in agriculture and rural enterprise along with new residents who would have a valuable contribution to make.  I am thinking of teachers, garda&iacute; and professional people, who would normally come to live in rural areas and provide services as well as becoming involved in the community.</P>
        <P>There are villages in my constituency which are now classified as settlements.  When that was done in the last development plan everyone believed they were being earmarked for development, whether housing, industry or whatever.  With the new population growth idea however, this is not the case.  People have bought land within these settlements.  I am speaking about small developers, such as a local man who bought a small holding and then sought planning permission for it.  He built a few houses but is now unable to sell them.  He has gone broke and his company is in liquidation.  We need to provide infrastructure.  To do that, we must have developments big enough to provide it.</P><Col N="726"/>
        <P>We will lose out on the community gain which came from these developments.  They were providing the infrastructure needed.  A rural village in County Kildare which did not have a water and sewerage plant got the opportunity under the plan to provide them.  If the Minister&rsquo;s new guidelines on population are enforced such places will not get water and sewerage treatment plants and neither will they have schools or anything else.  This is a much bigger issue than is realised.</P>
        <P>Planning must have a bottom-up approach together with a top-down approach.  Officials prepare draft guidelines and plans and, in the case of local authorities, elected members adopt these plans.  It is my view that public representatives should have independent technical and legal advice available to them in this work.  For too long public representatives have been overwhelmed by official-speak along with an overwhelming amount of documentation and an inability to get officials to accept how these plans effect ordinary people, such as people wanting to relocate within their own county.  Under the Kildare development plan a person can only receive one planning permission.  If he or she wants to upsize or downsize, a second planning permission will not be given and the householder must go and live in a town or village.  A person who wants to sell or relocate for family reasons may want an occupation clause lifted.  This will not be done until the five year period has expired.  Families who want to move from an urban to a rural area for family reasons or for work or business will not be allowed to do so. Take the example of a  family who obtain a local authority house in a town and whose sons or daughters, when they need housing, go back to the family&rsquo;s original home.  They will not be given permission to build because they are now classified as urban dwellers.  What is wrong with rural families moving from one county to another or building a home in their adopted county?</P>
        <P>Local needs and local growth needs in county development plans should be flexible in these recessionary times and ensure good planning is adhered to.  It is important that objectives for development plans should recognise existing settlement patterns and not be prescriptive or give rise to stringent requirements that effectively prevent investment in new development and businesses from operating once they have received the necessary permission.</P>
        <P>Towns and villages should have development plans and should not be classified as settlements.  Development plans clearly outline planning and development objectives for the future.</P>

	<P>I am glad to have a chance to speak on the Bill.  It is one of those funny Bills.  It is called the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 and it is described as a Bill to support economic renewal and promote sustainable development.  I cannot find that in the Bill and I do not know what it will do to support economic renewal.  I have gone through the Bill and I have read the Minister&rsquo;s speech but I am not convinced it does anything different from what is there at present, except to tighten up one or two things.  There is nothing wrong with the Bill but it is not the be-all and end-all of economic renewal.  I had hoped it would go into more detail in certain areas.  Perhaps that will happen on Committee Stage.  The Bill will not solve as many problems as it promises to do.</P>
        <P>We will have a chance to add to the Bill and improve it.  Having read the Minister&rsquo;s speech, I know what he wants to do.  It is a pity he, or someone like him, was not responsible for planning a number of years ago.  This is a case of closing the stable door when the horse has bolted.  Many of our current problems are the result of bad planning.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to his objective of carrying out flood risk assessment as part of the control and regulation of development in areas at risk of flooding.  I understood that was already in place to ensure planners did not build on flood plains and on lands that flood.  New legislation is not necessarily needed to prevent that.  Planners and engineers in county councils <Col N="727"/>need to listen to local people.  In any case in which I have been involved where there was flooding following development, the potential for flooding was flagged and planners and engineers were told by local people who did not have degrees in planning but who knew the land would flood because they had seen it happen year in, year out.  It is silly that we did not listen to them.  There are numerous examples of that.</P>
        <P>I was involved in a case in my area where a new county council graveyard was being provided.  All the locals said the field flooded every year but nobody listened to them.  The graveyard was built and it floods.  We do not necessarily need new laws but common sense and instructions to planners to take on board people&rsquo;s opinions, especially if there is proof of flooding, and not to put objections and submissions to one side because people might not have planning degrees.  Very often people are not wrong and local information is required.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about towns in the commuter belt suffering the most from the economic downturn.  He was correct in what he said.  Towns such as Navan, where I am from, Trim and Naas and other towns in the greater Dublin area &mdash; the Acting Chairman, Deputy O&rsquo;Connor, might mention Tallaght &mdash; suffered badly in the Celtic tiger years from stupid planning and a lack of planning.  Many of the development plans which caused the problems were from the 1990s &mdash; 1996, 1997 and 1998 &mdash; when field after field was zoned.  Since then, development plans have been generally quite well done.  I was involved in one in my town when I was a councillor &mdash; the 2003 development plan.  Excellent planning was done on it but most of it has not come into force yet because development stopped.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about trying to correct things in this Bill, which I believe have been corrected.  The development plans in which I was involved in 2001, 2002 and 2003 all used local area plans, strategic development zones and so on for proper planning.  There are some great plans in place which will come on stream in the future and which correct the balance in planning in regard development land for housing versus school sites, infrastructure and so on.  Quite often that was missing.  However, it is there now so I am not sure what new great things this Bill will do.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about the scatterings of estates with no schools and so on.  That is a major problem which must be addressed but it will need to be addressed through council funding and by putting in place infrastructure which is missing.  A Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill or otherwise will not fix that, rather it will be money and proper targeted resources in those areas to correct bad planning decisions which were made by parties on all sides.  Bad decisions need to be corrected but this Bill will not do that and the Minister should not necessarily speak about it.  As I said, the plans are in place to fix it.</P>
        <P>The Bill states that councillors and planners will have to provide evidence that they have had regard to national spatial guidelines, the greater Dublin region planning guidelines and so on.  The national spatial strategy more or less skips the commuter belt zone and goes beyond it.  It is a long time since I read it in 2003, 2002 or even before that when it was published.  The reason I read it was that it barely mentioned my county of Meath or the counties around it which have suffered from bad planning and where the majority of houses were built.  The spatial strategy directs funds and investment elsewhere.  If we ever get the chance to debate that document, which must be seven or eight years old, we might be able to point that out and show where it is flawed and where it misses an opportunity to direct investment in infrastructure,  industry and so on into areas which have suffered from all that housing.</P>
        <P>In addition, we should use the outer ring of Dublin as a springboard to link it to rural areas.  I refer to places beyond the M50, to Drogheda, Navan, Naas, Kilcock, Bray and so on.  They could be the link with the areas beyond them such as Athlone, Roscommon, Kilkenny and so on.  To skip those areas completely was wrong.</P><Col N="728"/>
        <P>I am disappointed this Bill refers to the national spatial strategy as if it is the be-all and end-all.  It is not because we have not discussed it.  I rarely hear about it being used in policy formulation elsewhere.  Perhaps this Bill is an attempt to try to have it used.  The regional planning guidelines and the greater Dublin guidelines are spoken about a lot, they are issued a lot, they are updated and so on but the national spatial strategy is not.  I am not convinced this Bill will do much because the document itself is flawed.</P>
        <P>The Minister said only minor changes will be allowed after the public consultation.  I am not happy with that.  When preparing a development plan, politicians, including councillors and Deputies, assume members of the public know all about it, are fully tuned in, read every amendment and know what is happening in the fields behind their houses but they do not.  It is usually many years before they discover what is going on.  When something is being built, they realise they should have objected to it or amended the plan but they have missed that opportunity.</P>
        <P>New ideas often come in during the process of a development plan which might be significant and encourage councillors to zone a different field or make a big decision.  I know guidelines are set down for the different stages of a development plan, the consultation period and so on, but this Bill speaks about limiting it to minor amendments after the consultation stage.  There is nothing wrong with returning the consultation stage for a third or fourth time if necessary with a major amendment.  It is proper and good planning.  It would give people a chance to change their opinion when new ideas come in.</P>
        <P>The Bill should provide that if there are proposals to zone land in a certain area for industrial or commercial use, housing or whatever, we advertise it more publicly.  A little note in a local or a national newspaper is not good enough to inform thousands of people in an area who might not read.  If we are to zone land, a large sign should be put up in the same way as with a planning application in order that people&rsquo;s attention is drawn to it and that they can have a real say in what happens in their community.  That would be a useful amendment but it is not in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Minister said decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in regard to routine cases will only require a quorum of two members instead of three.  I am not convinced that will work and I have a problem with it.  We need to look at An Bord Plean&aacute;la because it is not working fast enough for a modern society.  Things have slowed down but decisions need to be made more quickly.  During the boom times, a nine month plus timeframe was ridiculous.  Many planners, engineers and architectures are unemployed so there is no reason An Bord Plean&aacute;la cannot increase its staff and make decisions more quickly based on the current rules.  Having two members will not work because there will be logjams.  The use of three members always worked.</P>
        <P>I have an issue with An Bord Plean&aacute;la not listening to its inspectors who go out on site and do reports.  There are many examples of where an inspector does a good report but it seems to be put to one side and the board makes its own decision.  I question that.  The more staff in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the quicker the decisions.  Less than two years ago, the Minister gave a commitment to the committee to increase the staff in An Bord Plean&aacute;la but I have not seen any changes.</P>
        <P>I was involved in a case recently in Carton House.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la made a decision to refuse a science park, or a smart park as it was called, based on current planning laws, and I am not saying it was wrong in what it did.  That is something this country badly needs and it would support economic renewal.  Planning was refused because the development was on a very important site, Carton House demesne, which has connections with this building.</P><Col N="729"/>
        <P>When one walks the site, one realises An Bord Plean&aacute;la might have been wrong.  Although the planning laws perhaps meant it had no choice but to refuse permission, common sense would suggest that this park would have blended in quite well and could have been facilitated.  Will the Minister consider trying to strike a balance between the protection of heritage, the environment and so on and good economic planning in this Bill or in another one?  We must move forward, create jobs and make some tough decisions.  It might not be possible to have all the nice things and none of the not so nice things.  Smart parks and science parks are the norm in other countries but not here.  Common sense is needed and the manner in which the law is applied should be changed.  Anyone who visited the site in question would realise that the decision was wrong.  It may be necessary, therefore, to change planning legislation.  The Minister should consider doing so in this Bill because if we are to create jobs and emerge from our serious economic difficulties, we must ensure decision making becomes more commercial.</P>
        <P>It has been argued that, as a result of the Bill, improvements will be made to the effectiveness, efficiency and environmental sustainability of the planning code, including the facilitation of e-planning and so forth.  How equipped is this country for environmental planning?  I am not convinced we are up to speed in this area, which will become more important in future.  I do not believe environmental and planning experts in local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la have a sufficiently high level of training.  Perhaps the Minister of State will correct me in that regard.  The Bill affords us an opportunity to address the issue of training.  Should different training be provided, for instance?</P>
        <P>I am not convinced that environmental impact statements are of a sufficiently high quality.  Perhaps new guidelines are needed for environmental impact statements.  The economic slowdown provides an opportunity to fix these types of problems.  Rather than introducing legislation which offers ideas, the Minister should legislate for solving problems.</P>
        <P>The Bill refers to the provision and development of infrastructure.  Many local authorities, particularly those located in the commuter belt and have suffered from bad planning, rely on developer driven projects for the provision of new infrastructure.  To take my home town as an example &mdash; I am being parochial because Deputies&rsquo; expertise is in our respective local areas &mdash; people in Navan are relying on a developer to build a ring road for the town.  Given that developments are not proceeding at a fast pace in the current climate, the inner relief road for Navan, which is separate from a proposed by-pass, will not be built.  Other towns will experience similar problems.</P>
        <P>The Government, using taxpayers&rsquo; money, should provide infrastructure before developments commence.  Once a development has been completed, the developer should be charged the costs incurred in providing the infrastructure.  Waiting on developers to build or phase in infrastructure will not work and does not constitute proper planning.  If a developer decides not to develop his land, important infrastructure is not built.  Proper planning requires that money is provided to develop badly needed infrastructure.  This matter must be addressed.</P>
        <P>The Bill refers to contribution levies.  We heard that these levies will not hinder the establishment of new business and business people know what will costs they will incur before they start a development.  On the contrary, these levies are anti-competitive and hinder business.  They are wrong and amount to another high tax which people must pay in one lump sum at the start of a development.  The development levy was introduced during the good times as a way of reducing Government funding to local authorities.  I blame the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, for this clever ploy introduced to shove the costs of Government onto other people.  At one time, more than 90% of the cost of infrastructure provided by county councils was met by national taxes.  Nowadays, one is fortunate if the Government meets 60% of the costs and 40% are raised locally through contribution levies and other charges.  The levies <Col N="730"/>are wrong and are a sneaky way to do business because they mean the cost of infrastructure is not spread across the community through the tax system.  This problem is preventing development in certain areas and will lead to job losses.</P>
        <P>The legislation refers to taking account of an applicant&rsquo;s previous history when he or she seeks approval for a new development.  It also apparently gives stronger powers to a planning authority to refuse permission and refers to powers provided for under a previous planning Act.  While I was pleased to learn of a case in County Wicklow in which a development was refused on the basis of the applicant&rsquo;s history, I have not heard of many other cases of planning authorities refusing planning applications on these grounds.</P>
        <P>I understand from reading the legislation that the planning authorities must take cases of this nature to the High Court.  This means the implementation of a basic and simple provision of the planning legislation generates significant costs for the planning authority.  If somebody abuses the planning system, for example, by not finishing an estate, he or she should not be given planning permission for other developments until the previous abuse has been rectified.  This decision should be automatic, in other words, a black and white issue for the local authority, and should not require taking a case to court.  Local authorities should have the power to refuse all planning applications from persons with a poor record.  Too many developers have left estates unfinished or built bad developments before establishing a new company and being granted permission for further developments.  Ending this practice will only be possible when it becomes easy for planning authorities to enforce these provisions and they must no longer incur the substantial costs associated with taking a case to court.  Local authorities cannot afford to go before the courts.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government includes a commitment to ensure citizens information services have the necessary resources to assist and inform members of the public about planning procedures.  This is an admission that county councils are not informing people about the planning process.  I have spoken on numerous occasions about the need to educate people about local government, national government and the European Union.  The majority of people, including me, did not had an opportunity at school to study how the political system works at local, national and European level.  I accept, however, that a good system has been introduced in the education system.  Rather than providing resources to citizens information services to inform people about planning, we must establish a proper system for educating members of the public about rules and regulations, including in the planning area.  The library services to which people turn for information at any rate should be given this task, particularly as most libraries are operated by local authorities.  The Bill should address this issue.</P>

        <P>The Minister indicated that the Department&rsquo;s role is to lay down guidelines and monitor their enforcement.  It is not efficient to have 88 planning authorities in a small country, nor is this number conducive to good decision making.  While some town councils work well with county councils, there is a degree of overlap.  When a development is covered by both a town and county council the issue becomes complicated.  The Bill fails to address this matter.</P><Col N="731"/>
        <P>We must strengthen the role of local authorities in providing sites for schools and other important infrastructure.  The Department of Education and Science is supposed to find sites for second level schools, while local parishes and vocational educational committees are supposed to find sites for primary schools.  Responsibility falls between two stools.  The planning authority, in its development plan, marks school sites on its development plan but no one takes the bull by the horns and makes a commitment to deliver the site.  This Bill provides an opportunity to clarify where responsibility for securing and making available sites for schools lies.  This requires more than colouring in on a map the proposed location of a school site.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill.  It is regrettable that this common sense legislation was not introduced earlier given the damage that has been done as a result of poor planning.  Good planning will provide great benefits for individuals and communities.  High quality homes should be built in areas where industry is located and facilities such as shops, health care institutions, schools and public transport should be developed in rural areas.</P>
        <P>I have always felt sorry for people who have to travel long journeys, whether commuting to work, students going to college or others visiting hospital.  We see traffic congestion throughout the country and there is much debate about long commuting times to Dublin from all parts.  It is often forgotten, however, that many of the longest delays occur in places such as Claregalway on the Tuam-Galway road, which affect those travelling from north Galway, south Mayo, west Roscommon and further north.  There are serious delays in travel times in those areas which affect people commuting to work in Galway city every day.  It is also an issue for students travelling at weekends, as well as business people and those attending hospitals in the region.  It was therefore welcome news for me to hear the Minister for Transport talking about a new public-private partnership proposal for a motorway from Gort to Oranmore, bypassing Claregalway and on to Tuam, which it would also bypass.  It is hoped that will start before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>It is indicative of the large sums of money that have been spent on transport that we now have a motorway from Dublin to Galway, which was opened by the Minister in December, ahead of time and under budget.  Last weekend in Ballinasloe, some constituents of mine were saying that they can now get to Galway in 30 minutes and Dublin in 90 minutes, which is of great benefit.  The motorway network is of benefit to the whole country.  The Galway-Dublin motorway will mean that development along that route will be greatly increased also.</P>
        <P>In addition to road development, it is welcome to see that by the end of this month the Government will announce the commencement of train services from Limerick to Ennis and Athenry in County Galway.  It may happen before Easter and I hope the Taoiseach and Minister for Transport will be in Galway to mark that special occasion.</P>
        <P>The use of bus corridors along the Tuam-Galway road is very welcome.  Bus &Eacute;ireann and private bus operators have been calling for these corridors for some time and they are now a reality.  Such corridors can deal with some of the transport issues facing Claregalway, but more public transport development is also needed along with new roads to deal with current traffic congestion.</P>
        <P>Earlier, I referred to the legacy of rezoning and bad planning which fuelled the property bubble.  For all the building that went on, however, we did not have the necessary infrastructure in place.  Nor was there any co-ordinated infrastructural development in the west in particular.  I often wonder if Departments or State agencies speak to each other, because when water and <Col N="732"/>sewerage schemes are being developed no proper consideration is given to providing gas, Eircom, ESB or broadband services.  One would imagine that such basic facilities could be provided in conjunction with a water and sewerage scheme.  I had to lobby the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, very hard to get extra funding for high-quality broadband in Tuam in recent times.  It took me 12 months to get those broadband services included with the sewerage facilities.  Now that we have a good roads programme and more such development will be introduced, I hope we will see such co-ordination in future.  Hopefully we will also see broadband being introduced in conjunction with new railway lines.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about greed winning out over need when it came to planning, and that certainly has been the case.  We have seen houses built on huge areas of rezoned land without proper amenities being provided.  The Government has talked about introducing an 80% windfall tax on all rezoning decisions and hopefully that will be put in place.  We should concentrate on building houses where they are really needed, such as in Galway city which has a big waiting list.  Many young families are seeking housing there, so we need to get a good building programme going.  I hope that will happen.  In addition to the need for housing, figures show that schools, public transport and health facilities are also required.  All those issues should be dealt with quickly.</P>
        <P>It is often assumed that small provincial towns around Galway should act as dormitory areas.  While I would not accept it, if that were to be the case we will see more people travelling to Galway city from rural areas, whether for work or other reasons.  Retail businesses are important in a city like Galway.  I hope the development plans currently in place will include more retail units in smaller towns.  The development plans should include the provision of park and ride facilities there, as is the case with other cities.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement of his intention to publish a White Paper on local government.  That document should provide for a transparent and coherent local government system.  The Minister referred to statutory protection for whistle-blowers in the local government system, building on the approach introduced in many other areas of the public service, which I welcome.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the frustration over planning delays, whether at local authority level or with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Such delays should be improved upon.  In recent years, we have seen a major increase in planning applications but things are not as busy now.  It is hard to understand, however, why An Bord Plean&aacute;la is so slow in making decisions.  Consistency in such decisions is required, together with consistent development plans, housing policy, regional planning guidelines and spatial strategy.  The National Spatial Strategy designated gateways and hub towns, particularly on the west coast, and there was an expectation that decentralisation would follow from that, but disappointingly that was not the case.  Nevertheless, I hope we can build on some of the successful decentralisation proposals we have had in the past.  We should concentrate in particular on hub towns because they will find it harder to attract development compared to the gateways, which will develop anyway.</P>
        <P>Section 23 provides for an extension of permission for a period of up to five years in circumstances where substantial work has not been carried out, but where there are commercial, economic or technical considerations beyond the control of the applicant that substantially militate against either the commencement of the development or the carrying out of substantial works.  That is welcome because there are many reasons why a development could not take place within five years.  The Minister has covered some of the issues, including the economic one, which was particularly pertinent when the recessionary downturn hit us.  Other submissions related to the residential institution redress board and property that was not fully available, for <Col N="733"/>example when building a school or a health centre.  It is important to deal with this through an amendment to the Bill and I believe the Minister is considering the matter further.</P>
        <P>Section 28 refers to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the suggestion that the quorum for meetings be reduced from three members to two on the recommendation of the chairperson.  This is something I would welcome.  Planning has always been a difficult area.  I was a member of Galway County Council for 17 years and I am aware there was criticism of councillors who raised section 4 motions.  Many councillors felt there was no other option but to do that, because it was so difficult to get planning permission.  This gave rise to certain suspicion when councillors from east Galway supported proposals in west Galway and vice versa.  This area has been changed and section 4 motions are no longer used as frequently.  People had to do it that way at the time in order to deal with the problem of planning permission, particularly in west Galway.</P>
        <P>Some Deputies have referred to the issue of taking in charge of housing or residential estates by the planning authority.  Section 20 deals with the issue of developers who do not finish off estates.  It is very frustrating for residents of estates that are not properly completed.  There are also issues with regard to apartments, such as the behaviour of tenants, taps left running, leaks in apartments and noise.  I understand a Bill is to be introduced to deal with issue of noise.  This is a serious problem, especially where alarms are not checked and that are left to disturb people&rsquo;s sleep.  Often alarms go off during the day also.  I realise there are probably some legal problems in this regard, but I hope they will be addressed.  Section 20 also examines the question of refusing planning permission where an applicant has carried out a substantial unauthorised development.  There is also an issue of cost recovery.  It is important we deal with this area, particularly with regard to cases decided by An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the strategic infrastructure development provisions.  I hope there will be progress in this regard.</P>
        <P>I am very glad to see a section in the Bill to provide for removing any legal impediments to e-planning.  This has been promoted by local authorities and is an area where technology is helpful.  We also save money and can get information more quickly.  I understand from discussion with colleagues on Galway County Council that councillors and staff have attended numerous seminars to ensure they understand the technology and how to get the best results from it.  I welcome that.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke recently about the amount of land that has been rezoned for development and he mentioned that we had so much land zoned now that we had enough to provide development land up to 2075.  That is 65 years from now.  County development plans deal with a certain number of years, but we have land rezoned for 65 years hence.  One would wonder why this is the case.  It is ridiculous to rezone land for six or seven decades into the future.  I support the Minister in what he is doing to try and rationalise the planning system.  If this type of rezoning continued, we would have serious problems.  As it is, we have enough problems.  I would have serious concerns that we have rezoned for the next 65 years.  There was, of course, a property bubble and people lost the run of themselves.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about community gain.  This is particularly pertinent to County Galway because of the flooding situation.  Deputy English also touched on this.  If we have development levies &mdash; significant sums were collected in development levies when housing was at its peak &mdash; we would like to see some of the moneys from those levies spent on flood relief work.  Flooding has been a particular problem in south Galway and Ballinasloe and I was very glad to see that Ballinasloe town and County Galway have been given priority with regard to flood relief and dealing with the causes of flooding.  Unlike Deputy English, I am not clear as to what caused the flooding.  However, I am convinced there was never enough maintenance on our rivers and lakes and drainage committees never got enough funding to deal with the obstacles <Col N="734"/>in their way, although some simple steps could have been taken to deal with the threat of flooding.  I would like to see some of the moneys from the levies spent on flood relief works.</P>
        <P>Another important issue is planning for walking and cycling routes and for other such local facilities, even if these are only local routes to schools, shops and local facilities.  The provision of open space within developments is also important.  I was glad to see when we had sports capital grants, that many sports fields developed through these grants provided walking routes around their perimeters.  It is important for such facilities to provide a walking area and these have been welcomed by the public throughout the country.  I am glad these facilities have been provided in those areas where sports grants were made available.</P>
        <P>The Minister also raised the question of derelict sites.  There is a question of the use of levies to try and encourage owners to improve these sites.  I have praised the Minister on the development of motorways.  However, I have noticed significant numbers of vehicles being used on roadsides to display advertising.  This is probably because the motorways have moved business away from some of the restaurants, filling stations etc. along the former routes.  This is a problem.  We should have rest areas and places to stop along our motorways, but no doubt that will happen in due course.  We should not allow vehicles advertise along the side of motorways.  I would like to see proper signage at cross roads for such advertisements.  People should advertise their facilities properly and not distract motorists by using cars or other vehicles.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill, but regret it was not introduced earlier.  Much damage has been done through irresponsible planning.  However, it is still not too late to change.  If we follow the right policies, we will have good planning and development in the years ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity of speaking on this legislation.  A good point on which to start is the one on which Deputy Kitt finished: while I welcome this Bill, it is a pity we did not have it much earlier.  It was during the boom years that we needed such legislation, to allow proper spatial planning and development and ensure the work that was required was done properly, avoiding the rampant development that took place in unrestrained fashion throughout the country.  Over the last ten to 12 years, planning was in many ways a cowboy business.  The situation was also quite bad in earlier years.  An assistant county manager was convicted of corruption, a number of councillors were accused of taking bribes and a Minister had to resign.  Inquiries into the planning process were set up and are still not complete with regard to areas in which serious abuses were identified.</P>
        <P>I would like the Bill to go much further than it currently does.  There are still serious problems with regard to zoning.  The amount of rezoning that has taken place in the last number of years is incredible, as is the fact that windfall profits are still being made from rezoning.  The Kenny report, which recommended that profits from rezoning should not be more than 25% of the market value, has not yet been properly implemented.  Whenever there are vast sums of money to be made in any arena, the temptation is there to cut corners to ensure it can be made.  Money was made hand over fist over the last couple of decades as development operated in a rather uncontrolled fashion.</P>
        <P>In addition, spatial planning never effectively took place.  Many of the flood plains of Ireland &mdash; not just around urban areas such as Dublin, as the Acting Chairman knows, but also in rural areas &mdash; have been built on.  Development in Wicklow and Meath, on the borders of Dublin, has resulted in flooding of rivers such as the Dodder and the Tolka in the heart of the city.  There are whole communities in my constituency whose members find it almost impossible to get insurance because sufficient steps were not taken to prevent flooding.  In this decade alone we have had two serious floods in my own constituency which came about, we are told, because <Col N="735"/>of building on the flood plains on the perimeter of the city.  The same situation has arisen around the country, including in Carrick-on-Shannon, where many houses built on flood plains around the town were destroyed, and many other rural or semi-rural communities.</P>
        <P>Extravagant building has taken place in areas where nobody is prepared to buy.  Holiday homes built on the basis of tax incentives are now wanted by nobody.  This is a result of the manner in which we conducted our business, not just in the planning process but also in setting Government policy.  Anybody would know that one should not built on a flood plain.  If one lives beside the Shannon, one does not build on an area that is lower down than the Shannon.  Nobody is going to drain the Shannon in our lifetime; they never drained it in anybody else&rsquo;s.  Because of climate change, most rivers now have a tendency to flood at times.  The &ldquo;perfect storm&rdquo; coincidence of a major rainstorm with a high tide was thought to happen only once in 100 or 200 years, but we cannot expect that any longer.  These are issues that should be considered carefully.</P>
        <P>Similarly to the development of holiday homes, we saw today in the newspapers the consequences of out-of-control hotel development.  We now have many zombie hotels &mdash; hotels that are surplus to requirements &mdash; due to bad planning and lack of control.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue of the planning process itself.  Most people who seek planning permission complain that the process is far too cumbersome and weighted against the applicant, while those affected by planning applications believe the process is weighted in favour of developers.  There is always tension because of this.</P>
        <P>My own experience is that local authorities tend to be too generous in granting planning applications without sufficient scrutiny and, as a result, decisions are often left to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The board is making more and more decisions because so many planning applications that were granted rather too easily by local authorities are appealed.  That is the problem.  If the planning departments of local authorities did their work in the first instance and imposed the necessary restrictions on planning permissions so that people affected by developments did not feel aggrieved, there would not be so many referrals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which would allow the planning process to move more quickly.</P>
        <P>There should be a greater emphasis on rigorous examination of planning applications by local authorities in the first instance.  I have found An Bord Plean&aacute;la to be rigorous in its work, and it listens carefully to submissions made whether in support of or against a development.  However, about 40% of all major applications in Dublin now end up with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is not satisfactory.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A similar issue about which I have a bee in my bonnet is retention planning permission.  This must be considered carefully.  I remember tabling an amendment to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2002, when Deputy Dempsey was the Minister in charge, to the effect that retention planning applications should not be allowed and that fresh applications must be submitted instead.  If one built a house without applying for planning permission, as we saw recently in the case of a house built in a beauty spot in the Dublin mountains, it would have to be removed.  In that case, as Members may have seen in the newspapers last week, the local authority directed that the entire structure be demolished and the beauty spot restored to its original condition.  If we allow retention applications on a large scale, many people will simply get on with it and start work on their planned structures without waiting for proper permission, which is unsatisfactory.</P>
        <P>To give an example from my own constituency, a large telecommunications mast was erected by a corporate entity, O<sub>2</sub>, just behind the houses in Claremont Court.  Planning permission was obtained, but because nobody saw the application or knew about it, nobody objected to it.  The <Col N="736"/>period specified in the application was five years, but after this time had expired, the mast was not removed.  The company then applied for retention planning permission.  The local authority sought enforcement but because the retention application has not yet been decided upon, it is unlikely the case will ever appear in the courts.  The problem is that the company was able to submit a retention planning application although it should have been a new application because the period of the previous planning permission had expired.  This is not satisfactory and the problem is not addressed in the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Just over four years ago I brought the Good Samaritan Bill 2005 before the House and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform referred it to the Law Reform Commission for consideration.  In the intervening period, the Law Reform Commission has published two reports, both recommending the concept and need for this legislation.  I revert to the House tonight to pursue my desire to have this Bill enacted.</P>
        <P>I will be straight about my motivation for this Bill.  I firmly believe it will save lives and further promote active citizenship.  In 2003 I became aware of the necessity for a community first responders scheme when the concept of publicly available defibrillators was still in its infancy.  The Bill does not just cover such activities but casts a wider net and proposes to protect people from any civil proceedings for damage caused to another person, if they aided a person in good faith in an emergency.</P>
        <P>This is a simple and practical Bill requiring no funding or resources.  In 2005, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, recognised the need for and concept of good Samaritan legislation; hence the referral to the Law Reform Commission.  I hope that tonight the current Government will recognise the importance of this Bill and accept it in its entirety.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this Bill is to protect from liability those who go to the assistance of others who may be ill or injured as a result of an accident or other emergency.  This legislation will ensure that those who intervene to give help to others and who offer this assistance in good faith cannot be penalised or held liable as a result of their intervention unless there is a case of gross negligence.</P>
        <P>Section 1 deals with the title of the Bill and the timeframe in which the Act should be implemented, which is one month in this case.  Section 2 sets out the necessary definitions in the legislation and Section 3 states that the good Samaritan shall not be held liable in any civil proceedings for damage caused to another person where assistance, advice or care was provided <Col N="737"/>to the person who has been injured in an accident or circumstances of serious or imminent danger.  The exception to this is in the case of gross negligence.</P>
        <P>Section 4 refers to the circumstances in which volunteers are not liable and to the circumstances in which they are; this again refers to cases of gross negligence.  Section 5 deals with bodies formed for the purpose of giving assistance for the benefit of the community.  Such bodies are liable in cases where damage is caused by the failure to take such care as is it is reasonable to expect.</P>
        <P>The main advantage in passing this Bill is that it will be easily accessible and ready for immediate use, especially when there is no case law.  It will also be authoritative, having been passed by the Legislature.</P>
        <P>One may ask if there has never been a case concerning this issue, why bring forward an unnecessary solution?  I remain firmly of the view that the absence of such legislation is prohibiting the involvement of volunteers in some projects and the further roll-out of defibrillators in the community.  Many reports of the Government have highlighted the fear of litigation as a deterrent to voluntary work.</P>
        <P>In this country there is no existing duty, for example, between an employer and an employee and the general principle is that there is no liability for a mere omission to act.  There is no legal obligation to warn someone who is about to walk into a trap or to rescue him from a dangerous position when he has done so.  However, if one intervenes and adds to the damage, we do not yet know in Ireland if there is liability.  The result of all this may be that the good Samaritan who tries to help may find himself or herself involved in damages while the priest and the Levite who pass by on the other side can go on their merry way.</P>
        <P>This Bill can give protection and has been shown to do so in case law in the United States, and many countries have similar good Samaritan legislation.  During the debate on the issue in 2005 I referred to various instances of case law.  One case, Boccasile <i>v. </i>Cajun Music Limited 1997, involved a man suffering an allergic reaction to food he consumed at a music festival.  Another case is Pemberton <i>v</i>. Dharmani, a malpractice case in Michigan in 1994.</P>
        <P>There is a legal maxim of <i>volenti nonfit injuria, </i>roughly construed to mean no injury is done to one who consents.  It has its origin in the process by which Roman law validated the act of a free citizen selling himself into slavery.  In the 19th century it found its way into the law of tort.  The principle is that a person may not sue in tort if he or she had given an express or implied consent to the act complained of.  In many of the situations I envisage where this legislation may be of use, consent may not be possible due to the condition of the injured party.  Even knowledge may not be possible, and knowledge in itself is not consent.</P>
        <P>The biblical parable of the priest, the Levite and the good Samaritan is often used to teach the virtue of helping someone in need.  There is a desire in virtually all of us to help a person whom we perceive to be in immediate danger.  This can range from saving a person from drowning to helping to change a car tyre.  However, with the evolution of society this desire takes other issues into consideration.  How often have we heard about someone who stopped on a road to assist and ended up as the victim of a mugging?</P>
        <P>The good Samaritan issue is not a concept that has been discussed widely in Ireland, mainly because it has not arisen in any tangible form.  The claim, often made, that the door was closed after the horse had bolted cannot be made in this case as Fine Gael, by bringing forward this Bill, intends to assist in the development of volunteerism.</P>
        <P>The issue has arisen in other countries.  As a general principle, common law does not require a bystander to help someone in danger.  This legislation does not make this a requirement either; the priest and the Levite would not be liable for failing to assist the stranger.  However, <Col N="738"/>a bystander is safe as long as he or she does absolutely nothing.  It is my firm belief that some time in the future we will see in our legal system a claim for damages where a person chooses to intervene and adds to the injury.  Our courts have a strong tendency to ensure that someone picks up the cost for injury to a person, and passing this Bill should lessen the chances of the willing helper being that someone.</P>
        <P>It is not uncommon to have statutory modifications to the common law.  In Quebec, Canada, the law imposes a duty on everyone to help a person in peril.  The duty to assist a person in danger is evolving in France and Belgium, and we all remember the photographers in the Princess Diana case.</P>
        <P>My primary motivation for this Bill is to assist in encouraging the availability of defibrillators in the community through sporting clubs, commercial outlets, schools and any location where large crowds are likely to gather.  Since the Bill was originally published in 2005, I acknowledge the great strides that have been made by the HSE ambulance service in rolling out defibrillators and the first responders scheme.  However, I am aware that the fear of litigation, whether justified or not, has acted as a barrier to encouraging more people to volunteer.  This simple legislation can address this problem and we need to ensure the virtue of the good Samaritan concept carries over to our legal system.</P>
        <P>Cardiac Self Help Wicklow, now Wicklow Community First Responders, is a voluntary group established in autumn 2003 with a view to making defibrillators available in the wider community.  Every year, several thousand people die in Ireland from sudden cardiac arrest.  There are many causes, such as genetics, illness, heart attack, environmental conditions and even physical contact.  Thanks to the ambulance service working with voluntary groups across the country, first responders schemes are up and running in many areas.  Many communities are in the process of setting up a scheme and it is our intention, with the co-operation of communities, to extend this service throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In addition, local groups and schools can privately purchase a defibrillator and have it available in their immediate area.  This is known as targeted defibrillation.  The scheme in Wicklow went into operation in spring 2005 and now has more than 500 active members, representing almost 30 areas.  Similar schemes exist in Roscommon, Cork and other parts of the country.</P>
        <P>To assist with targeted defibrillation, legislation will be necessary to deal with the concerns of volunteers who fear litigation.  This is such a Bill.  The Government has repeatedly called for ideas from this side of the House and the implementation of this one will greatly improve our health service at virtually zero cost.</P>
        <P>It is said that Ireland is becoming a more litigious society.  These days, how do we ensure that our legal system does not act as a disincentive to people to get involved in voluntary work to the benefit of their communities and society as a whole?  How do we ensure that a person who gives of their time to assist with a volunteer cardiac response unit is not left without legal protection?  Over the past ten years, many reports have highlighted the need for legislation to cover those who act as a good Samaritan or volunteer in administering fist aid or other emergency procedures.  The Government published a white paper in 2000 on supporting voluntary activity.  The document noted that:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The Irish Constitution recognises the right to associate.  Overall, however, there is an underdeveloped legal and policy framework in Ireland for the support of voluntary work and the contexts in which it takes place.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In 2005, the European Volunteer Centre published a country report on the legal status of volunteers in Ireland and noted there is no specific legislation relating to volunteers here.  In <Col N="739"/>2006, the taskforce on active citizenship was established and its terms of reference requested it to make recommendations which &ldquo;could be taken as part of public policy to facilitate and encourage a greater degree of engagement by citizens in all aspects of Irish life, and the growth and development of voluntary organisations as part of a strong civic culture&rdquo;.  In its 2007 report to the Taoiseach, it stated that &ldquo;the fear of litigation has become a growing barrier for many community and voluntary groups&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The 2006 report of the national task force on sudden cardiac death syndrome, Reducing the Risk: A Strategic Approach, stated that Ireland has no good samaritan law to protect members of the public who go to the aid of another person.  The HSE&rsquo;s 2008 cardiac first response guide also reiterated the views of that report, stating that &ldquo;one of the main stumbling blocks to communities purchasing defibrillators and developing programmes has been a concern over legal indemnity&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>One of the phrases used repeatedly by this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government is &ldquo;social capital&rdquo;.  The decline in what is referred to as social capital is frequently lamented by the Government and is a phenomenon witnessed by all of us in the new Ireland of the 21st century.  While speaking of the importance of promoting social capital, the Government is not taking concrete action to match those words.  The final recommendations of the task force on active citizenship lie unimplemented.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael brought forward this Bill in 2005 and the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated it was flawed legislation.  This was untrue but he put that construction on the Bill for his own benefit.  However, he proposed at the time that the concept be sent to the Law Reform Commission.  We welcomed that.  We have had two reports since from the Law Reform Commission, the first of which went out for general discussion.  The strong recommendation from many of the groups that made contact with the commission was to bring in good samaritan legislation.  The commission published its report last year and published a draft Bill which was virtually a replica of the Fine Gael Bill, with just two slight differences.  The first was the issue of a professional person going to assist somebody and the second was the extension in the commission&rsquo;s Bill to cover an organisation that was represented by a volunteer.  We published that Bill in its entirety as we are anxious that legislation be brought in.  It was a replica of the Fine Gael Bill and we have listened to the Minister tell us he wants to hear proposals from the Opposition.  We have brought forward proposals and I am outraged that the Government has tabled an amendment kicking this to touch.</P>
        <P>I had given consideration earlier today to withdrawing this Bill, because the Government has treated this proposal with disdain.  It speaks of active citizenship and volunteers, yet it administers a kick in the teeth to those same volunteers because it does not want to acknowledge the role of a progressive and positive Opposition.  It puts its own self-serving agenda ahead of the people.  I could have spent the last few months lobbying these voluntary groups.  We will not see a story about good samaritan legislation on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> or the <i>Irish Independent</i>, and it will not be mentioned among the chattering classes.  However, it is a major issue under the surface and those groups will discover over the next few days that the Government has turned down progressive legislation for no reason other than that it does not have the magnanimity, virtue, compassion or interest in Irish people to bring forward legislation that quite simply costs nothing.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment mentions a civil law miscellaneous provisions Bill, but the heads of that Bill have been published and there is no reference to good samaritan legislation.  This story will not end up on the &ldquo;Nine O&rsquo;Clock News&rdquo;, but it is a very sad day for this House.  The Minister knows what this Bill is about, and although his colleagues in the Cabinet do not, they will over the next few weeks.  Many voluntary groups realise what the Government has <Col N="740"/>done.  Every report, including reports commissioned by the Minister&rsquo;s Government, have recommended this legislation, but the Government simply did not have the good grace to give a little bit of credit to the Opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Billy Timmins and Charles Flanagan for bringing this important legislation before the House.  This Bill is basically about protecting the good samaritans in our society.  These are the people who selflessly risk life and limb to save others, whether as members of voluntary organisations or individually.  They currently do so knowing that in our litigious society, they are leaving themselves wide open to being sued for their trouble.</P>
        <P>This Bill has been recommended by the Law Reform Commission in a recent report.  Two significant developments have occurred to make the issue particularly relevant, namely, the rollout of defibrillators in public places and sporting venues and the promotion of active citizenship by the task force on active citizenship.  There are more than 5,000 sudden cardiac deaths on average in this country every year, so it makes sense that defibrillators can be used to attempt to save lives without fear of prosecution.  More than 500,000 people volunteer in the Republic, which is a third of the active adult population, providing the equivalent of 96,450 full-time workers.  Their selfless work deserves to be free from fear of litigation.</P>
        <P>This matter was previously examined in a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, the Good Samaritan Bill 2005, which was followed in 2007 by a consultation paper and a seminar last May, leading to the publication of the final recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  I welcome the fact this Bill does not force ordinary people, under the provision of duty, to go to the aid of someone in danger.  However, professionals such as garda&iacute; and members of the Defence Forces should have the necessary training to provide a duty of care to the general population.</P>
        <P>Cases such as that in Wigan, England on 3 May 2007, in which a young boy drowned because two police support officers made no attempt to rescue him, have never occurred in this country as far as I know.  However, a lack of training and a lack of obligation to attempt a rescue could result in a similar situation.  Surely there is a strong case to be made between the duty of a professional and non-professional person.  I would be shocked to think that a member of any police force should be able to stand by while someone&rsquo;s life was at stake and still be immune to prosecution.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, there was a recent case in the UK where a postman attempted to sue the woman who had come to his aid after he slipped on the snow, calling an ambulance and administering first aid.  She subsequently rang the hospital to inquire about his condition.  What did the postman do in return?  He attempted to sue his rescuer, but dropped the claim when he discovered the issue would not be handled through insurers.  This is just the sort of situation the Bill seeks to prevent.  Fear of litigation should not be allowed to prevent people doing what is essentially their moral, if not legal duty to aid someone in distress.  What has gone wrong with society when our first response to a cry for help is, &ldquo;this is not my problem&rdquo;?</P>
        <P>People all over the world have become hardened to the distress of others, due to the &ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo; societies in which we live.  This Bill is a chance to rectify some of the fears of litigation that people have been forced to endure.  While the Bill goes a long way to alleviate those fears, the fact that rescuers are exempt from civil liability unless there is gross negligence means that unless one has specific training in first aid, life-saving procedures and so on, one&rsquo;s natural instinct to help could still by default lead to prosecution.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s amendment shows its determination to sideline this Bill, as it did in 2005, replacing it with the civil law miscellaneous provisions Bill.  This will negate the need for the <Col N="741"/>Bill before the House to be read a second time in September.  It will also ensure the Government will not be obliged to vote against the very necessary measures contained in this legislation.  Shame on the Minister for allowing this to happen.  I thought he had adopted a hands-on approach in his portfolio but it seems he has not done so.  I hope the Taoiseach, when he reshuffles the Cabinet next week, will take the necessary action in respect of the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill and commend Deputies  Billy Timmins and Charles Flanagan on its introduction.</P>
        <P>When the Good Samaritan Bill was debated in 2005, a number of issues arose and the then Attorney General, Mr. Rory Brady, senior counsel, referred them to the Law Reform Commission, LRC, for clarification.  The LRC published its final report last May and recommended that in order to give protection to those who were concerned that they might face litigation if they intervened and assisted as a good samaritan, rules should be clearly set out in statute.  It also proposed that the legislation should provide a full defence against civil liability unless there was gross negligence.  The Bill before the House would provide such assurances and also give solace to people who offer assistance in good faith that they would not be held liable as a result of their action.</P>
        <P>Good samaritans are born, not raised.  We have all witnessed the heroism that is displayed on a daily basis when in an emergency one person comes to the aid of another simply as an act of kindness.  If someone is involved in a car accident, if he or she is seriously injured and if the car bursts into flames, moving him or her could save his or her life.  However, the law must reflect this.</P>
        <P>Other jurisdictions have been obliged to introduce legislation in this area as a result of court decisions.  For example, the decision in the Van Horn <i>v</i>. Watson case in California led to the introduction of three items of legislation.  The court in California held that non-medical good samaritans were not entitled to liability protection when there was an injury as a result of their actions.  In this case, Lisa Torti moved Alexa Van Horn out of a car in the belief it was going to explode and that the latter would be burned.  Alexa Van Horn alleged that the movement caused her subsequent paralysis.</P>
        <P>In Canada the position on good samaritan acts varies from province to province.  In Quebec people have a general duty to respond in an emergency.  In British Columbia they have a duty to respond only where a child is endangered.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Timmins indicated, when Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a car crash in Paris, the focus was placed on the paparazzi who had taken pictures of her following the accident.  Under French law, the photographers involved could have been accused of a criminal offence for failing to provide assistance for a person in need.  Ultimately, three photographers were each fined a symbolic &euro;1 by the French appeals court for taking pictures of her and that was the end of the case.</P>
        <P>The law should not discourage people who arrive on the scene of an accident from offering the best help possible.  Sadly, in an emergency members of the general public can be deterred from assisting others.  This is because they are afraid they will be sued.</P>
        <P>Irish people are renowned for giving help during a crisis.  During the worst of the recent flooding and also the cold snap ordinary men and women rose to the challenge and assisted the emergency services.  I saw evidence of this in my constituency in County Clare where people filled sand bags, provided assistance for their neighbours, gritted roads and helped individuals being evacuated from their homes.  When the crisis was at its height, an elderly man went out to feed his cattle.  On failing to return, a major search got under way.  The Garda, Civil Defence and local volunteers found him and he was rescued by the Irish Coast Guard helicopter.</P><Col N="742"/>
        <P>The increase in the number of sudden cardiac deaths among young people has resulted in the availability of a greater number of publicly accessible defibrillators.  However, the HSE&rsquo;s 2008 guide for cardiac first responders notes that civil liability is a stumbling block for some communities.  If we are to encourage these communities to use defibrillators, legislation to provide for legal indemnity must be put in place.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a history of voluntarism.  Over 30,000 volunteers assisted in the Special Olympic Games in 2003.  According to the 2006 census, 553,000 people are involved in voluntary activity of some form or other.  We must ensure we continue to support and encourage voluntarism.  The Bill before the House would provide a legal framework for volunteers to continue to lend a hand in our communities.  It would also provide protection for good samaritans, without whose actions many lives would be lost.  There is no reason for the Government to fail to support the Bill.  It is letting the people down in this regard.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to reconsider the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like previous speakers, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  I commend Deputies Billy Timmins and Charles Flanagan on its introduction.</P>
<P>When the Good Samaritan Bill was introduced in 2005, it was referred to the Law Reform Commission which I understand has given its <i>imprimatur</i> to that legislation.</P>
        <P>In the light of the history of the Bill and the fact that it is necessary, non-contentious and would not involve a cost, I am disappointed that the Government has tabled an amendment and intends to hide its provisions away in a Bill which will be introduced later in the year.  I appeal to it to reconsider its position prior to the end of Private Members&rsquo; business tomorrow night.</P>
        <P>There has always been a need for legislation of this nature.  Its passing at this time would be appropriate, particularly as voluntarism and active citizenship are required now more than ever.  We witnessed the appetite for voluntarism during the flooding that occurred prior to Christmas and also during the recent cold snap.  People could not do enough to assist their neighbours or those who were isolated or in danger.</P>
        <P>I have worked as a volunteer in my community, both as a sports coach and as a teacher, for all of my adult life.  I also benefited from the services of volunteers during my time as a player.  In the good old days people were prepared to become involved because they were not concerned about litigation or anything else.  However, the position has changed to a major degree.  I am aware of many people who would love to assist sports clubs or community organisations but who are afraid to become involved.  It is not worth the hassle if there is a threat of litigation.  During the cold snap shopkeepers were afraid to clear snow and ice away from the front of their premises for fear that they would be taken to court in the event that something untoward happened.  Clarification was provided in respect of such circumstances but that which I have outlined is an example of the fear among people and highlights why the Bill is necessary.</P>
        <P>When I worked as a teacher, I took charge of numerous sports teams and witnessed at first hand the need for legislation of this kind.  This is particularly the case in the light of the cutbacks in education funding in recent years.  Previously, a couple of teachers would accompany school teams to matches at other schools&rsquo; grounds.  That is no longer possible.  In addition, one teacher would look after the team if the other was obliged to take an injured player to hospital.  Again, this is no longer possible.  As a result, trainers face a dilemma if a serious injury occurs.  The individuals concerned must decide whether they should remain with the team or accompany the player who has been seriously injured to hospital.  I was placed in such a position during a <Col N="743"/>match and obliged to ask someone in attendance to bring an injured student to hospital.  However, the individual in question was afraid to do so owing to concerns about what might happen on the way to the hospital.  Such situations could be avoided if legislation such as that before the House was on the Statute Book.</P>
        <P>Deputy Timmins referred to defibrillators.  A few years ago everyone was touched by the death of Cormac McAnallen.  That was a tragedy which could have been prevented.  I am not stating legislation such as that before the House would resolve everything but it would certainly help us to avoid tragedies such as that which befell Cormac McAnallen.</P>
        <P>Everyone knows the importance of encouraging community spirit.  At a time when many thousands are in a position to give of their time and expertise, they should be allowed to do so.  The Bill is non-contentious and would not involve a cost.  It should be above politics.  It would reflect well on politicians and all parties in the House if the Bill were accepted.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this fact before the matter is pressed to a vote tomorrow evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate and commend Deputies Timmins and Charles Flanagan on bringing this Bill before the House.  If anything can send out a good signal of proper work and thought in this House, it is support of this Bill.  Like Deputy Timmins, I was extremely surprised that the Government tabled an amendment to prevent us from passing the Bill through the House.  We need to send out a message of support for the very many voluntary organisations and groups.  It would reflect well on the body politic and would show that we are genuine about doing what people want us to do.</P>
        <P>At a time of an emergency in the country &mdash; we saw it during this winter in particular &mdash; with the roads, storms or bad frost, people are extremely concerned about doing volunteer work such as clearing snow from footpaths, which was done and to which reference has been made.  During a particular 48-hour period, nobody would go near the footpaths or roads outside their houses simply because they were extremely worried.  If this Bill did nothing else except send out a signal that we will protect those people who make genuine efforts to help others in their local communities, it would be important.  I have seen at first hand in Clonmel, which has been flooded in recent years, the number of volunteers who turn up and help people flooded out of their homes.  The Bill will give such people protection if anything happens.</P>
        <P>A total of 553,000 people are involved in volunteerism, whether in their local communities or at national level.  They may be involved in point-to-points, race meetings or in the GAA.  They are involved in the basic things of life.  We are living in times of severe economic hardship.  Local authorities are not able to cope with some of the issues confronting them.  Many volunteers are willing and anxious to help in a crisis.  If this House does nothing to protect them, then as a country and as a Government we are not looking after them.  The technicalities of the Bill were dealt with by other speakers but I wanted to contribute because it sends out a signal to the huge number of volunteers.</P>
        <P>The most critical issue is that of defibrillators.  They are used and available in every village and town throughout the country.  As we close down our hospitals we will have more need for defibrillators.  The Government should give this consideration.  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is a practical man.  He should reconsider what he is doing here because of the message it will send out.  We need a clear signal that volunteers are protected.  That is the main thrust of the Bill, which I support.  The Minister should give very serious consideration to supporting what Deputies Timmins and Flanagan have proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important Bill introduced by my colleagues, Deputies Billy Timmins and Charles Flanagan.  </P><Col N="744"/>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to protect from liability those who go to the assistance of others who may be ill or injured as a result of an accident or other emergency.  The Bill is an important and necessary addition to the legal protection available to those who volunteer to assist others in need or in emergencies.  It fits into the general framework of legislation covering the relationship of responsibility between the conscientious citizen and society.  People have a responsibility to raise genuine concerns about dangers to public safety, fraud or other serious malpractice.</P>
        <P>Under certain legislation, there is now a specified duty on persons to report concerns.  Typically, these persons have a duty of confidentiality, but they also have an overriding duty, in the public interest, to report misconduct to the authorities.  Typical areas covered include accounting fraud, tax evasion, insolvency, bankruptcy, financial services for money laundering and proceeds of drug trafficking, child protection and mandatory reporting of suspected abuse.  In all of these cases there is a legal requirement to act and to disclose.  Contrast that with the legal protection available to those who volunteer to assist others in need or in emergencies.  There is no legal obligation or positive duty on citizens to intervene to assist an injured person or someone who takes ill suddenly.  Neither is there any specific statutory protection where persons act in the public interest to assist an injured person or someone who takes ill suddenly.</P>
        <P>We have a classic situation of having a legal requirement to talk to the relevant authorities about particular financial services and child protection situations and full legal protection for those who talk, where the communication with authorities is made in good faith.  The contrast with someone in an emergency situation, injured or ill could not be greater.  The concerned citizen can talk elegantly about what should or should not be done. He may or may not call emergency services.  If he or she does not call the emergency services there will, in all probability, be no legal consequence.  However, if the concerned citizen, out of a sense of common humanity and good citizenship, volunteers to provide practical emergency assistance to the person in need, the legal protection available to that good Samaritan enters a grey area.</P>
        <P>This Bill is designed to provide certainty this legal grey area.  A person who volunteers to assist others in need or in emergencies should have clear and specific legal protection.  Society must send a clear message to those who choose to act in an emergency and this Bill provides that message.  It must be safer and more rewarding to act in emergency situations than to do nothing.  The law must send a clear signal that persons who act responsibly in emergencies will receive statutory protection.  This Bill provides that safety net to good Samaritans and it is very important legislation.</P>
        <P>Deputy Timmins has been working on this legislation for a number of years and raised it in the previous administration.  This issue has gone on for far too long.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony stated, people are very litigious and it is amazing what happens after people fall and someone comes to their assistance.  Legal entities can take over and it can become a matter for litigation.</P>
        <P>I applaud the availability of defibrillators.  We have a very large voluntary sector which acts very correctly.  They are very positively-minded.  The Order of Malta and other organisations give of their time voluntarily.  Having the legal protection that would be provided in the Bill makes much sense.</P>
        <P>The Minister is very practical and considers matters in a sensible manner.  Taking on board this Bill would be the intelligent thing to do.  It would send a very clear message to those in the voluntary sector.  I have no doubt people act very responsibly in emergencies and do not consider or size up the legal risks.  However, accepting the Bill would reassure civic-minded people and give them the confidence to participate on voluntary defibrillator courses.  They are now in almost every sporting club and I applaud those who raise money to have defibrillators readily available.  It is very important.</P><Col N="745"/>
        <P>I compliment Deputy Timmins.  He has campaigned vigorously for the introduction of the Bill and I congratulate him on it.  I hope the Minister will acknowledge his efforts and enact the Bill as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1: </P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5"><?oasys _ix ?>noting the commitment in the Government Legislation Programme published on 19 January 2010 to publish a Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in the current session;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5"><?oasys _ix ?>supporting the inclusion of provisions in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to provide more adequately for the civil liability of good samaritans and volunteers;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5"><?oasys _ix ?>noting that drafting of that Bill is at an advanced stage,</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5"><?oasys _ix ?>resolves that the Civil Liability (Good Samaritans and Volunteers) Bill 2009 be deemed to be read a second time on 2nd September 2010.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Government proposal is that the House defers for six months the second reading of the Private Members&rsquo; Civil Liability (Good Samaritans and Volunteers) Bill 2009.  The Government does not oppose the Private Members&rsquo; Bill as such.  We thank Deputy Timmins and his colleagues for promoting the principle of what is involved, with which I agree entirely.  However, the Government is in the final stages of preparing its own legislation which, it believes, will address the matter more adequately and more quickly.</P>
        <P>The Government legislation will also set out to protect from liability those who, acting with good intentions, go to the assistance of those who are injured or ill as a consequence of an accident or emergency.  The Bill&rsquo;s purpose also will be to ensure that a well-intentioned person who helps someone who is ill or hurt in an emergency need not fear being sued as a result of his or her intervention.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises that fear of civil liability can hamper volunteerism and may prevent individuals and groups from providing assistance and services to others.  Without greater legal certainty in this area, the concern is that the perception may continue that there is a risk of civil liability to those who provide assistance or services on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.  That potentially discourages volunteerism and may raise insurance premia for volunteer groups.  Changes in society, the pace of life, and working patterns mean that volunteerism is under stress from many angles and greater clarity in the law would encourage volunteerism to the benefit of the State and society as a whole.</P>
        <P>When Deputy Timmins brought forward his earlier Bill on this subject in June 2005, his stated primary motivation was to specifically smooth the path for the introduction and use of defibrillators in the community, by removing the fear of litigation if the intervention did not go as far as intended.  The Deputy&rsquo;s entirely commendable intention was to remove perceived obstacles in terms of vulnerability to litigation from the emergency use by volunteers of defibrillators at sporting events, in schools, in shopping centres and in other locations and circumstances where people might suffer sudden cardiac arrest.  Such legislative proposals have wider implications for the volunteer community in general, and are not limited to situations requiring cardiac resuscitation.</P><Col N="746"/>
        <P>At that time, the Government considered the objective of the 2005 Bill to be entirely worthy, but the Bill failed in several respects to adequately address the complexities of the law in this area and the matter was referred in January 2006 to the Law Reform Commission for an in-depth review.  The Law Reform Commission published its Report on the Civil Liability of &ldquo;Good Samaritans&rdquo; and Volunteers in May 2009.  I note that the Bill replicates precisely the draft provided by the commission in that report.  In December 2009 the Government agreed to include the relevant provisions on good samaritans into the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill we are now bringing forward.</P>
        <P>The key recommendations by the Law Reform Commission were the following.  First, to maintain the position in common law not to impose a general duty on any category of persons to intervene for the purpose of effecting a rescue or assisting an injured person or a person at risk of injury.  Second, that the range of individuals that constitutes good samaritans and volunteers and the types of intervention they may make should be set out in statute.  The actors envisaged are those who act &ldquo;voluntarily and without expectation of payment or other reward&rdquo;.  Third, that legislation should set a standard of care for good samaritans and volunteers, which is above the threshold of gross negligence, an understanding of which should also be addressed.  Fourth, that legislation should set out an ordinary standard of care for volunteer organisations or undertakings and that account should be taken of the benefits which have accrued to society because of the organisation&rsquo;s work in determining whether it is just and reasonable to impose liability.</P>
        <P>The recommendations of the Law Reform Commission were fully accepted by the Government.  The Government subsequently approved my proposals for the drafting of provisions to legislate for good samaritans in the proposed Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  That Bill is in the course of being drafted for publication in this session in accordance with the Government legislation programme announced by the Chief Whip on 19 January 2010.  The Government&rsquo;s legislative proposals will incorporate the commission&rsquo;s recommendations and some additional provisions to ensure that the law is as comprehensive as possible.</P>
        <P>In examining the commission&rsquo;s recommended Bill, my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General has identified issues requiring attention.  These issues are not addressed in the Private Members&rsquo; Bill nor in the Bill proposed by the Law Reform Commission, and their omission would result in a text that would fall somewhat short of the ideal.</P>
        <P>The Private Members&rsquo; Bill leaves unresolved important policy and drafting matters.  Greater clarity is required around the kinds of scenario that might give rise to protection from civil liability.  For example, should the advice, assistance or care given by a good samaritan or volunteer be restricted to the scene of an accident or should it include transportation to a hospital or other medical care facility?  How far into the future from the time of the accident or emergency ought the protection from liability stretch; until the injured person receives medical attention for the first time or beyond that?  Other points of clarification include whether a person who caused the accident or emergency in question in the first place could be categorised as a good samaritan thereafter, depending on his or her behaviour.  We would not want to exclude such a person from protection under this legislation as long as he or she behaves with the requisite reasonableness and care expected when helping those who have been injured.  That issue is not addressed in the Private Members&rsquo; Bill before the House.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s proposed legislation will also seek to ensure that persons who merely appear to be injured are included within the scope of the legislation alongside those who are actually injured.  It would not make sense to protect a good samaritan from liability for coming to the aid of someone with, let us say, a broken leg, but not to provide protection from liability <Col N="747"/>if he or she attempted to assist an essentially uninjured but intoxicated person.  There are legislative provisions along these lines in other common law jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>The Private Members&rsquo; Bill protects certain persons from liability for damage, which could include death or personal injury.  I propose to ensure that damage to property falls within the scope of this definition.  There are many situations where damage to property would be a natural consequence of coming to a person&rsquo;s rescue.  For example, it might be necessary to do damage to a person&rsquo;s vehicle when extracting him or her following an accident.  Another issue that arises is who is envisaged as the potential plaintiff.  This may be limited to the person directly affected by damage at the hands of the would-be good samaritan or volunteer or may include a dependant of such a person.</P>
        <P>Technical drafting issues also require to be clarified, particularly around the appropriateness or otherwise of defining in statute certain core concepts including, for example, &ldquo;gross negligence&rdquo;.  That concept has heretofore not been defined in a comprehensive or satisfactory way, either in national or relevant international law.  The most relevant Irish case law, according to the Law Reform Commission report, dates back to 1948.  Therefore, we must tread carefully to ensure the necessary complexity and subtlety is captured.  To establish negligence there must be: a duty of care &mdash; in other words the existence of a legally recognised obligation which requires a defendant to conform to a certain standard of behaviour to protect persons from harm; a breach of the standard of care; actual loss or damage to the interests of the plaintiff; and a close causal connection between the defendant&rsquo;s conduct and the injury caused to the plaintiff.</P>
        <P>The duty of care is broadly speaking a duty that one must not injure one&rsquo;s neighbour.  In other words, one&rsquo;s actions must not cause injury to others or put others into harm&rsquo;s way.  Our courts fashion the duty of care and specify its scope with the simple aim of accomplishing social goals.  What must be remembered is that very different factual situations arise in particular cases and each situation must be carefully examined before it can be determined whether a duty of care exists and the scope of that duty.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that the law should not be amended to impose any general legal duty to intervene to rescue people in danger over and above what exists in the law already, for example, the duty on employers to provide first aid assistance to employees under the safety and health at work legislation.</P>
        <P>Many civil law states with code-based systems, including those of continental Europe, have imposed positive legal duties to intervene to rescue.  However, the position that there should not be a general legal duty to intervene is deeply rooted in the common law for both philosophical and practical reasons.  That is reflected in numerous cases in this jurisdiction and in comparable international jurisdictions.  Common law in this area has long emphasised the concept of proximity to one&rsquo;s neighbour before a duty of care arises, and draws a distinction between that which is morally desirable and that which is legally required.  While inaction or, for example, a failure to attempt a rescue may lead to injury or death just as much as careless action, it is only where there already exists a clear duty of care that civil liability could arise.  While a high standard of care, including a positive duty to act, is set for parents in respect of their children, for instance, strangers are held to a lower general standard not to act in a way that would harm or injure another.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission correctly concluded that it was unlikely that a general duty to intervene would promote volunteering or active citizenship.  Moreover, the commission was informed by the groups it consulted that imposing such a duty might have the opposite effect.  With a view to legislating properly and comprehensively on this matter, the Government&rsquo;s preference is to proceed, as announced in our legislative programme, with the civil law miscel<Col N="748"/>laneous provisions Bill as the vehicle.  The Government is taking on board the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission by incorporating the principles of the commission&rsquo;s draft Bill into its own Bill.  In light of this, my proposal is to defer the Second Reading of the Private Members&rsquo; Bill for six months.  The effect of the Government&rsquo;s amendment is to retain the Bill on the Order Paper so it may be progressed through the House in the unlikely event that the civil law miscellaneous provisions Bill is not enacted quickly in the meantime.</P>
        <P>The civil law miscellaneous provisions Bill covers several areas including, as was agreed in December, provisions relating to good samaritans and volunteers.  The Government has given priority status to the drafting of this Bill because it includes other provisions which must be passed before 31 July.  As such, I can offer a guarantee that the Bill, including the provisions relating to good samaritans and volunteers, will pass before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>I compliment Deputies on the other side of the House on bringing forward this Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  I also compliment the Law Reform Commission which spent considerable time in bringing forward its report and the legislation that flowed from it.  As I said, there are several defects in the Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  I do not say that in order to be critical of the Deputy who brought forward the Bill or of the Law Reform Commission.</P>

	<P>I make these points respectfully, although I have been subject to political criticism from the other side of the House.  I hope the House will not divide tomorrow night on this important issue.</P>
        <P>However, Members opposite will recall that we agreed in December to include provisions relating to good samaritans and volunteers in the civil law miscellaneous provisions Bill.  Moreover, it is the view of Government, on the advice of the Attorney General, that the Law Reform Commission report and the Bill it produced, which Fine Gael has replicated verbatim, is not complete.  As I said in my speech, it is important that we do this properly.  The original advice from my Department was that we should oppose the Bill, but I consider it better to prioritise the passing of the civil law miscellaneous provisions Bill and adjourn the Fine Gael Bill for six months to ensure we give precedence to the Government Bill, which is in the final stages of drafting.  As a result of provisions in the Government&rsquo;s Bill which must be passed before 31 July, namely, those relating to the granting of an intoxicating liquor licence for the national conference centre, the Bill will pass as a matter of priority.  Therefore, I can assure Members that the provisions we are including in that Bill in respect of good samaritans will also become law before the summer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>It is encouraging and positive to see Private Members&rsquo; time being taken up with <Col N="749"/>proposed legislation, albeit legislation devised by the Law Reform Commission.  It is fitting that Private Members&rsquo; time should be used in this way given that we are primarily a legislative body.  While motions have their uses from time to time, this is the best use of Private Members&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>Deputy Timmins observed in his introduction that the legislation he is proposing is not to address any specific problems that have arisen but rather to avoid such problems in the future.  It is a stitch in time saves nine approach.  That type of anticipatory legislation is to be welcomed.  On the other hand, it is also the case that we have time to get this right.  We should not stand on ceremony and demand that it is my way or no way.  The Law Reform Commission was asked by the Government to look at the considerations that must be borne in mind in the preparation of legislation, and it has done that.  As the Minister outlined, there is a specific time pressure in terms of getting the relevant Government legislation, the civil law miscellaneous provisions Bill, onto the Statute Book.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to give advice to Deputy Timmins, who is an experienced parliamentarian, but it is an achievement for any Opposition Deputy to have legislation he or she has brought forward, or the principle of that legislation, accepted by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is particularly true in the case of this Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>That is to the Deputy&rsquo;s credit.  This has been a collaborative effort between the Government and the Opposition.  The public is crying out for that type of co-operation rather than the usual Punch and Judy stuff that goes on.  We may pretend we are vicious fighting factions but the truth is far from that.  We work best when we work together.  In this case there has been a commonality of views on the issues that are arising in the course of the debate.</P>
        <P>The amended motion from the Government side urges a postponement of the Second Reading of the Private Members&rsquo; Bill given that drafting of the Government&rsquo;s civil law miscellaneous provisions Bill is already at an advanced stage.  The principle of the Private Members&rsquo; Bill is already provided for in the Government&rsquo;s legislation.  Both Government and Opposition share the same objectives in this matter, namely, to protect from liability those who, acting with good intentions, go to the assistance of those who are injured or ill as a consequence of an accident or emergency, and to ensure that persons who volunteer to provide care, advice or assistance to others for the greater good of society have some clear protection in law.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is an unfortunate perception among some members of the public that to come to a person&rsquo;s aid in an emergency or to volunteer for work in the community will leave them exposed to being sued in the event that some mishap or injury occurs as a result of their actions, no matter how ordinary or reasonable those actions may be.  However, many decades of case law both in this jurisdiction and in comparable common law jurisdictions emphatically contradict that perception.  The Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s 2009 report on this subject made the point clearly.  In layman&rsquo;s terms, all that is expected in law of the average person is that he or she act reasonably in all circumstances and not behave in a grossly negligent way towards others.</P>
        <P>However, because of the perception that one is vulnerable to suit if one participates in a rescue or in voluntary work in the community, there has been a call from voluntary groups and organisations for the Government to provide clarity and certainty in statute as to what is expected from those wishing to participate in various aspects of volunteerism.  That said, Ireland has a long and continuing tradition of volunteering and active citizenship both at home and abroad.  This Government has long been to the forefront in encouraging greater participation by its citizens in community life.  Voluntary activity is central to developing civic-minded, responsible citizens who are committed to making a positive difference in the communities in <Col N="750"/>which they live and work.  Active citizenship is not just for other people; it is for each of us individually, as well as for the Government, business, the media, unions and various other organisations, to decide how we can engage with each other and create together a set of shared values for a better society.</P>
     <?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s focus over the past number of years, in terms of citizen engagement, has been to put in place measures to encourage greater participation by everyone in the issues that affect their daily lives.  The issue of concern being addressed in the proposed legislation is one of ensuring that barriers to civic engagement, whether real or perceived, are minimised to the greatest extent possible.  Where there may be fears of litigation against individuals genuinely acting as good citizens, one must alleviate such fears and provide a legal basis on which to protect such individuals who act for the common good.</P>
        <P>During the consultation process conducted by the Law Reform Commission on this issue, Ms Mary Davis, who chaired the task force on active citizenship, was invited to share her experiences of volunteering in respect of the concerns of people who wished to get involved in voluntary activity.  She outlined how the fear of litigation is a concern and is reflected in the difficulties that many organisations face in obtaining affordable public liability insurance.  The extension of the group insurance scheme through the Irish National Community and Voluntary Forum was one of the recommendations of the task force, and this has been implemented through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Significantly, the nationwide consultation and research that was completed by the task force in 2007 found an overwhelming willingness to participate despite the barriers that many experienced which hindered or prevented them from contributing time to community activity.  It comes as no surprise, therefore, that capacity-building supports provided to citizens are of increasing importance in enabling them to influence in a positive way the decisions that affect them in their daily lives and which make it easier for them to become involved.</P>
        <P>I believe the Government&rsquo;s efforts have helped to increase levels of community involvement and to generate a renewed willingness in Irish society to become involved and to help others.  Some of these measures include supporting capacity development among community and voluntary organisations, particularly in the area of training; extending the number of volunteer centres to provide a link between organisations and volunteers throughout the country; completing an audit of community, sports and arts facilities to inform the Government on the provision of facilities and to identify opportunities for getting the best use of recreational facilities nationwide; strengthening local civic participation through legislation on local government reform; encouraging schools to make their premises available for the use of community and other groups after school hours; and developing a syllabus for a full optional exam subject called &ldquo;Politics and Society&rdquo; as an extension of the current civic, social and political education subject in the junior cycle, which at present gives students practical experience of active citizenship.</P>
        <P>I also should note that as Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, it falls to me to discharge the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that the voice of children is heard in matters that affect them and to ensure that children try to take a more active part in citizenship.  This is achieved through a number of measures, including the D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g process, which will meet in plenary session in Croke Park on Friday of this week and at which, together with other policymakers and civil servants, I will be obliged to face a rigorous cross-examination by representatives of comhairl&iacute; na n&oacute;g from all over the country over the course of the day and at which various propositions will be voted upon.  This provides an opportunity <Col N="751"/>to young people to genuinely influence policymakers on issues that affect them.  Moreover, tomorrow I will attend the Young Social Innovators Speak Out forum at Griffith College, at which young people again will have an opportunity to share their experiences of various issues and to put together their views in this regard.  Through such measures, the Government gives real effect to its obligations under the United Nations and the national children&rsquo;s strategy and to its intention to ensure that young people become involved in volunteerism and active citizenship.</P>
        <P>Ireland is also fortunate to have such a long tradition of neighbourliness and volunteerism, which is not lost on the majority of people in today&rsquo;s fast-changing world.  The traditional spirit of meitheal still thrives in this country, albeit in a different form, whereby the strongest communities are those which work together to deal with the many challenges of modern living.  This was borne out in a report by the Central Statistics Office last July entitled, Community Involvement and Social Networks in Ireland 2006, which showed that almost two thirds of people regularly take part in voluntary or community activities.  The Government&rsquo;s role is to continue to foster those higher values of neighbourliness, of caring and to facilitate citizens within and across communities who are committed to enhancing their local areas or to working to find solutions to local issues together.</P>
        <P>Good samaritan legislation is one element in the broader policy area of volunteering and active citizenship that will assist in encouraging greater levels of civic engagement.  I acknowledge that while progress has been made regarding many of the recommendations of the taskforce, in respect of policy changes that could enable greater levels of participation by young and old, the global economic downturn will inevitably adversely affect or delay the implementation process as Departments and Government agencies grapple with the difficult task of finding savings to alleviate pressure on the public finances.  Ironically, an article published in <i>The Irish Times</i> in recent months reported a huge increase in the number of highly-skilled people engaging in volunteerism but noted the apparent link between this increase and the unfortunate rise in unemployment.  Nevertheless, there is clearly a good base on which to encourage even greater citizen participation through the statutory copperfastening of legal protection from civil liability, within reasonable limits, for good samaritans, volunteers and voluntary organisations.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputies Timmins and Charles Flanagan for their work in furthering this agenda.  In commending the amended motion to the House, I re-emphasise that the introduction of this Bill by the Deputies was worthwhile because the Minister has made a commitment to the effect that it will find its way onto the Statute Book by the middle of this year.  This is on foot both of the work of the Law Reform Commission and the work carried out in 2005 when Deputy Timmins originally introduced the Bill.  I commend the amended motion to the House.</P>

	<P>Very good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I compliment Deputy Timmins for introducing this legislation in Private Members&rsquo; time.  I also compliment him on his tenacity in seeking to secure its passage of this legislation.  I note that in the less than five years since he last introduced it, no action has been taken by the Government in the meantime.  Moreover, I can imagine the response he then received from the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, which I am sure was not terribly positive.  I hope the present Minister will do as he promised, which is to ensure that his proposed legislation, namely, the civil law (miscellaneous provisions) <Col N="752"/>Bill, will be enacted this year.  I had not realised that the national conference centre required a liquor licence and that this needed to be done in the context of its opening.  As I had thought it was going to open much earlier, that is, next month, perhaps it will be obliged to operate for some time without the liquor licence.  However, were the Minister to deliver on this commitment this year, it would be very welcome.  I also commend Deputy Timmins on keeping this matter on the agenda and ensuring that it is being addressed in a serious manner.</P>
        <P>As other Members have noted, the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that those who assist and take steps to help others and who do so in good faith will not be held liable for any unforeseen adverse circumstances that might occur as a result of their actions.  Citizens who volunteer their services to help others should, I believe, be cherished and protected from any negative unintended consequences of their activities.  This should be established and clarified in a formal, certain, statutory fashion as is proposed in the Bill because the last thing one needs is for the present confusion to continue to reign.  Where there is doubt, all such doubt should be removed and this should be done once and for all.</P>
        <P>The reason is that enormous numbers of people, more than 550,000 adults in Ireland, provide volunteer services.  They are the unsung heroes who volunteer their time and skills and who expect nothing in return.  They make a significant contribution to the quality of our society.  Volunteers and good samaritans provide the cement that binds human relationships, promotes team spirit, develops social networking, gives the impetus to the positive human development and social values and principles which enhance our humanity and underpin our society.  These are extraordinarily important matters that in the main are provided by volunteers.</P>
        <P>The Government has been active in this respect.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was a strong promoter of volunteerism and active citizenship.  If we as a country go down that road, surely we must put a framework in place that does not endanger those who provide their services for free or allow them to become liable due to an act of negligence by those of us in this House.  We have a responsibility to ensure that they do not incur a liability when they act in good faith.  This is the important issue.  Although there may not have been too many instances of such liability being incurred, it is important for us to make that assertion clear in a robust and formal legislative format.  How can we invite and persuade people to volunteer and become involved in active citizenship unless we do our bit to ensure that they can do so without incurring any liability?</P>
        <P>Deputy Timmins had a particular concern regarding defibrillators.  I have a particular concern, in that there has been profligate waste.  This issue can be addressed.  Every day in every town, supermarkets, grocery stores and bakeries dispose of food that has reached or passed its sell-by date.  Every day and night, there are skip-loads of it.  Supermarkets must dispose of it in such a fashion that it cannot be used.  They will not allow it to go to night shelters or to be used by the homeless or any agency where it might be consumed by humans.  They cannot do this because they fear liability, namely, that they could be prosecuted for making available foodstuffs that have passed their sell-by date and, therefore, might cause illness.</P>
        <P>Tens of thousands of tonnes of food are lost in this fashion.  It must be possible to find a mechanism whereby the sell-by date could be brought forward a little or the issue of liability in this respect could be negotiated.  There are many night shelters and food centres that provide meals.  The Capuchin Day Centre in my constituency provides more than 400 meals to the homeless daily.  The centre finds getting enough money to pay for that food difficult, yet there are skiploads of food that, if made available one or two days earlier, would have been perfectly good.  Perhaps that food is perfectly good as it is, since there must be a margin of error.  Due <Col N="753"/>to the liability, however, the food cannot be used.  This means that supermarkets must ensure there is dye in the food or it is disposed of in such a way as to make it inaccessible for human consumption.  I would like this matter to be addressed, particularly in an era in which making ends meet and finding enough food for everyone who is in desperate need of it is proving difficult.</P>
        <P>Different countries have different approaches.  In some countries, it is impossible for a citizen to provide aid.  One must go to the emergency service.  In Italy, for example, one must call an ambulance.  One cannot approach a person and provide first aid because doing so is against the law.  We should get our act together and, instead of putting a negative factor into the equation, make the situation as positive as possible.  If someone goes to the aid of another person and does so in good faith and in a reasonable fashion, no liability should be incurred.  This basis can be easily established in terms of legislation.</P>
        <P>Regarding the situations that can arise, first aid and 999 services are not far away in an urban setting.  In rural settings, however, the issue is more complicated.  Therefore, there are variations in terms of the isolation in which the good samaritan or volunteer provides his or her services.  These situations must be addressed in the legislation.  It is a complex matter.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s newspaper carries statistics in respect of Childline.  That there has been an increase of 200,000 in the number of calls, bringing the total to 800,000, is incredible, as is the fact that 300,000 of those calls have not been responded to because there were not enough volunteers and resources.  One can only respond to calls if there are lines.  The cost of providing these services is expensive, but this is a matter of great importance.</P>
        <P>Volunteerism is considerably important.  The figure of 550,000 people involved on a regular basis is colossal.  All of us know the football teams that are trained and coached every weekend and the amount of time given to under-six, under-seven, under-eight, under-nine and other under-age teams.  All of it is provided by volunteers.  In such situations, there are no doctors.  If one attends a match at Croke Park, there will be a doctor, as there will at a boxing tournament in the National Stadium.  If one attends a concert, the Order of Malta will probably be there, as will the Civil Defence.  They all have specific skills.  However, every day in Clonshaugh where so much of the training in question takes place, St. Anne&rsquo;s Park in Dublin or the Bogies in St. John Paul Park, hundreds of young lads and so on are in situations in which first aid might be a priority.  These issues must also be addressed.</P>
        <P>The essence of volunteerism is people who will provide a service free of charge and go to the assistance of someone who, for one reason or another, requires assistance.  This is where the action should be and where we should ensure that we give a positive message.  We should assert that people acting in that capacity should not incur liability.  For this reason, legislation is important.</P>
        <P>It may well be the case that liability is unlikely to be regularly incurred despite our litigious society.  Nevertheless, let us make strong and robust our message that we, as policy makers, want to encourage good and active citizenship, volunteerism and the concept of the good samaritan and to provide the legislative framework to make that possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to be associated with this Bill in the name of my colleague, Deputy Timmins.  The Bill reflects the twin objectives of reforming a harsh rule of law and recognising and protecting the good work of active citizens.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed by the response to the Bill by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his junior colleague.  It is clear that the only reason this Private Members&rsquo; Bill will <Col N="754"/>be voted down tomorrow night is that it does not come from the Government side.  I regret having to say this once again during Private Members&rsquo; time.  I listened with intent to the Minister, but there is no reason this Bill could not be granted a Second Stage reading tomorrow evening and brought before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Having regard to the reservations and technical points made by the Minister and the Minister of State, there is every reason the Bill could be perfected and tailored to suit their needs during a couple of hours of debate.  There is no other reason than that it did not have the Fianna F&aacute;il stamp and logo.  Once again, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is playing the narrow, partisan, political card in a D&aacute;il debate.</P>
        <P>The fig leaf of the ministerial response is underlined by his assertion that Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s Bill will be incorporated in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is No. 14 on the pink list, as announced by the Government in its legislative programme on 19 January.  In the foreword to the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill it is described as a Bill, &ldquo;to establish a Courts&rsquo; funds office to replace the accountant&rsquo;s office and assume other cash management and accounting functions, to make provision for an intoxicating liquor licence for the National Conference Centre and to provide for some miscellaneous matters&rdquo;.  Nowhere is there a reference to the Civil Liability (Good Samaritans and Volunteers) Bill.  Obviously, the Minister and his junior colleague had to engage in some panic measure today and yesterday and decided that this fig leaf would wash with members of the Opposition.  It is a sad day for Parliament when Ministers must continually revert to the narrow partisan political agenda.</P>
        <P>The reason for the Bill is obvious.  Law students in a tort or criminal law lecture are generally advised, &ldquo;Do not to rush to help somebody in trouble because if you do you will become liable for their welfare&rdquo;.  The message from the Irish State is, &ldquo;Do not help those in distress.  It is more trouble than it is worth&rdquo;.  That is a selfish and cynical message, particularly against the background of what the former Leader of the Government, Deputy Bertie Ahern, has prided himself on doing in the name of active citizenship.  The cynical message of &ldquo;Mind your own business, move on, turn the other cheek, turn the other eye&rdquo; does not foster a sense of community, generosity, kindness or good neighbourliness.  The State appears to suggest that citizens should look after themselves, step over people injured on the pavement, not rush to the aid of someone who has collapsed, turn the other cheek, look the other way and move on.  I&rsquo;m all right Jack.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael saw the need for legal reform some time ago and Deputy Timmins, to whom great credit is due, introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill in 2005.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, with typical intransigence, shot the Bill down.  However, the Bill struck a chord with a significant number of people.  The Law Reform Commission took up the baton and subsequently published a consultation document, followed by a full report with recommendations.  The report, by and large, reflects the concerns of Deputy Timmins and of Fine Gael.  As is customary, the Law Reform Commission included a draft Bill with its report, which is similar to Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  There is ample evidence that the approach of Fine Gael and Deputy Timmins makes good sense.  However, for reasons I have outlined and which, I regret, have become the hallmark of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Government drags its heels and refuses to take action.  The Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; Bill was introduced in 2005 but there was no response from the Government in 2006, 2007, 2008 or 2009.  Now, in 2010, hey presto, we are informed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the measure will be included in the provision for an intoxicating liquor licence for <Col N="755"/>the National Conference Centre.  It is most regrettable that progress on this matter ground to a halt, prompting Deputy Timmins to push reform in the Bill before the House tonight.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2007, two years after Fine Gael&rsquo;s Good Samaritan Bill was defeated by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, set up a task force on active citizenship.  He claimed he was concerned that active citizenship had gone into decline, something I heard echoed by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, and his Minister earlier this evening.  Is it any wonder that so-called active citizens are getting thin on the ground when helping a person in medical distress could land one in court, liable for considerable damages and in serious trouble?  Many people have become afraid to reach out to help others.  Simply administrating first aid could leave one responsible for the subsequent welfare of the person being helped.  These fears, undoubtedly, led to the reduction in civic mindedness referred to by Deputy Ahern in his active citizens endeavour.  The fear of consequential injury or illness militated against people performing good samaritan acts.</P>
        <P>At the same time there was a rise in sudden cardiac death syndrome, with a large number of people, many of them young people, dying each year.  There was, consequently, a need for defibrillators, as outlined by Deputy Timmins.  Voluntary campaigns throughout the country have seen the provision of defibrillators, particularly in sporting clubs.  We even have one in the visitors&rsquo; waiting room in Leinster House.  These days, most community and voluntary groups have a defibrillator at hand.  This is a wonderful and positive development.</P>
        <P>There is still a missing piece of the jigsaw, and this was addressed by Deputy Timmins.  Civil liability law needs to be reformed to ensure that good samaritans and those rushing to the aid of someone in need are not punished for their good works.  Defibrillators have become commonplace because they are a vital tool in the saving of lives.  A rapid response is crucial in the event of cardiac arrest.  The Law Reform Commission notes, in its report, that when a person who has suffered a sudden cardiac arrest is defibrillated within five minutes his chance of survival is approximately 50%, and potentially higher in a younger patient.  When defibrillation is delayed for ten minutes or more, there is virtually no chance of survival without cardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR, while the chance of survival increases to between 10% and 20% if CPR is used.  Therefore, a speedy and effective response is required if the chances of survival are to be increased.  Training is essential for those who operate defibrillators and now almost every voluntary group has a person trained in their use.</P>
        <P>A 2006 report by the national task force on sudden cardiac death syndrome, which the Law Reform Commission referenced, noted that Ireland has no good samaritan law to protect members of the public who go to the aid of another person.  This legal difficulty has been noted time and time again.  It is regrettable that the Government failed to act, in spite of the Private Members&rsquo; initiative in 2005.  The Law Reform Commission makes a number of recommendations which, by and large, reflect the provisions of the Fine Gael Bill before the House.   It notes that parliaments in Australia, Canada and in many states of the United States recognise the importance of fostering civic mindedness by protecting good samaritans from civil liability.</P>
        <P>Playing the narrow political card does this House no service.  I know, from speaking to Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers, that they support this legislation and from speaking to Members in every party I know there is no opposition to this legislation, except for the fact that it does not contain the Fianna F&aacute;il Party logo.  I hope colleagues on the opposite benches will support the concept of volunteerism as championed in words by former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Let us follow up in deeds.  One positive deed we can undertake is to pass into law Deputy <Col N="756"/>Timmins&rsquo;s legislation at the earliest opportunity and four years after it was unnecessarily and without justification shot down by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats.</P>

	<P>Currently, two men are on hunger strike outside the Green Isle factory in Naas, County Kildare.  Jim Wyse has been on hunger strike for 13 days and is starting into his 14th day tonight while John Guinan has been on hunger strike for seven days and is starting into his eight night.</P>
        <P>The dispute concerns what the union claims was the wrongful dismissal of three craftworkers.  The workers had 16, ten and seven years&rsquo; service.  The union&rsquo;s case is as follows.  In December 2008, the company made available on its IT system a file called &ldquo;Boardroom&rdquo;.  Direct access was given to one engineer but it was available to anyone else in the company by mapping the drive.  In March 2009, the engineer became concerned about a file which showed the planned termination of employment of six maintenance workers and he showed the file to his manager who, in turn, reported it to senior management.  Company letters were issued to the engineer and another worker asking them to disclose their full knowledge of the &ldquo;Boardroom&rdquo; file and warning them that it was a serious matter which could lead to their dismissal.  The union replied to the company stating that it was a company error which gave the workers access to the file.  Some days later the workers were dismissed.</P>
        <P>The matter was then referred to the High Court and proceedings continued for some months.  In June 2009, the company started separate proceedings against three workers, including the two already mentioned and one other.  At this stage, the union sought to have the issue of the &ldquo;Boardroom&rdquo; file closed as it was taking so long.  The High Court report issued in June 2009 and, in the event, the three workers were dismissed on 10 July 2009.  The union appealed the dismissals but following an investigation, they were upheld.  Pickets were placed on the company.</P>
        <P>The union referred the case to the Labour Court on 6 October 2009.  A Labour Court hearing took place on 4 December 2009.  The company did not attend the hearing but was represented by IBEC.  In a statement to the court, the company maintained that it did not engage with unions and that the court was not the appropriate forum to hear the case.  Its case was that the workers committed serious transgressions and that they were afforded all rights in the investigation and appeal hearings undertaken by the company.</P>
        <P>Since then there has been a scandalous campaign by the company against the workers implying they were downloading pornography.  Last Sunday, a Green Isle director finally admitted on RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; programme that the employees did not have Internet access.  He also admitted that the adult material was sent from an anonymous source to the employees&rsquo; e-mail in-boxes.  It was a total and an absolute distortion to try to slander the workers concerned.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court stated that on the information before it, the court was satisfied that the dismissals at issue were unjustified, that in the circumstances of this case, the normal approach of the court would be to recommend that the workers dismissed be reinstated without loss of <Col N="757"/>pay, that it noted that the union had revised its claim and was now seeking a financial settlement for those concerned and that it recommended that the parties engage, through an intermediary if necessary, with a view to agreeing an acceptable compensation package, that this engagement should continue for one week following the date of this recommendation and if final agreement was not reached, the matter be referred back to the court.  The court made a monetary recommendation for the three people in question.</P>
        <P>Currently, the two men are going into their 14th and eight day on hunger strike.  I visited them today, last Thursday and the Thursday before that.  It is a very serious situation.  I have no doubt that behind all of this is an attempt to de-unionise workers working in the plant.  Green Isle was an Irish company which was sold to an English multinational company.  Currently, most workers employed in it are non-nationals.  The future of the trade union movement and of Irish workers is being tested.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister and the Government to intercede, if necessary.  I, nor does anybody &mdash; I understand other parties have met the workers &mdash; want to see this hunger strike continue because it will do irreparable damage to the men&rsquo;s health.  Jim Wyse is starting his 14th day on hunger strike.  I await the Minister&rsquo;s response and I hope he will not be found wanting in interceding if necessary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Ferris for raising this important matter on the Adjournment.  The strike involves a number of craftworkers who have been on strike since August 2009 in support of three dismissed colleagues.  I understand this dispute arose following a decision by the company to dismiss the workers following an investigation into alleged improper use of the company&rsquo;s IT system.  The union representing the affected workers, the TEEU, has disputed the company&rsquo;s stated reason for the dismissals and believes that the dismissals were a result of an earlier dispute over several workers sharing a confidential e-mail about redundancies, which had been sent to a union member in error.  I understand the company does not recognise the trade union for collective bargaining purposes, nor is it obliged to do so.</P>
        <P>The National Implementation Body had previously intervened in the dispute suggesting independent mediation by a third party outside the Labour Relations Commission and Labour Court.  However, this initiative was not taken up by the company.  The union subsequently referred the case to the Labour Court on 6 October 2009, in accordance with section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1969.  This means that the recommendation is binding on the union but not on the company.  A Labour Court hearing took place on 4 December 2009.  I understand that the company did not attend the hearing but that IBEC was in attendance.  In a statement to the court, the company maintained that it did not engage with unions and that the court was not the appropriate forum to hear the case.  Its case was that the workers committed serious transgressions and that they were afforded all rights in the investigation and appeal hearings undertaken by the company.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court issued its recommendation on 8 December 2009.  The court was satisfied that, on the uncontested information before it, the dismissals in question were unjustified.  In the circumstances of this case, the normal approach of the court would be to recommend that the workers dismissed be reinstated without loss of pay.  The court noted that the union had revised its claim and was seeking a financial settlement for those concerned.</P>
        <P>In this context, the court recommended that the parties should engage, through an intermediary if necessary, with a view to agreeing an acceptable compensation package, that this engagement should continue for one week following the date of the court&rsquo;s recommendation and that <Col N="758"/>if final agreement was not reached, the matter should be referred back to the court.  The court also recommended that the dispute should be ended on these terms and there should be an immediate return to work.  In addition, there should be no victimisation of any type on either side.</P>
        <P>Green Isle Foods rejected the Labour Court recommendation aimed at ending the strike.  Media reports quoted a company spokesman as stating that it would not be bound by the Labour Court recommendation as it did not accept that the court was an appropriate mechanism by which to resolve this issue.</P>
        <P>I regret that the company has not found it possible to accept the Labour Court recommendation and that it has not opted as yet for the established route of settling employment grievances.  The experience and expertise of the Labour Court offers the most appropriate and effective avenue for resolving such disputes.</P>
        <P>I understand that on 17 February 2010, a shop steward at the plant began a hunger strike in protest at the refusal by the company to accept the Labour Court recommendation.  A second worker joined the hunger strike on 24 February.  A third worker may join the hunger strike tomorrow, Wednesday, 3 March.  I understand the company has said that it had made every effort to resolve the dispute and that mediation at local level, involving members of this House, is being pursued in an effort to find a settlement to the dispute.</P>
        <P>It is a matter of great concern that this dispute has reached a stage where some workers believe they must go to the extreme length of going on hunger strike in order to achieve a settlement.  I very much regret that the company has so far not found it possible to engage with the industrial relations machinery of the State during the protracted dispute.  Notwithstanding the company&rsquo;s stance and mediation efforts ongoing at local level, the services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court remain available to the parties, if required, to assist in finding a resolution to the dispute.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or other collective disputes, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement machinery free of charge to assist this process which, in line with the general principles of industrial relations in Ireland, is voluntary in nature.</P>
        <P>I again urge all the parties involved in this dispute to work together to break the current impasse and to avail of the established machinery for dispute resolution.  I again thank Deputy Ferris for raising this matter in the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the Kilcummin and Waterville sewerage schemes together because the failure to proceed with both schemes is having a massive impact on amenities in my constituency.  With regard to the Kilcummin scheme, for many years the local authority and local residents sought a sewage treatment plant for the area.  In 2007 the Government sanctioned a scheme to bring sewage from Kilcummin to the treatment facility in Killarney.  No progress has been made since. </P>
        <P>The roads in the Kilcummin area are in a deplorable state.  The local authority has taken a decision, with which I do not disagree,  not to upgrade local roads until the sewerage scheme is completed.  Residents of the area are suffering on two fronts because they do not have a sewage treatment facility and on the basis that the local authority has refused to upgrade local roads <Col N="759"/>until a facility is developed.  The proximity of Kilcummin to the Lakes of Killarney &mdash; the area is three miles north of Killarney &mdash; makes it vital that the construction of a sewage treatment facility proceeds.  As the Minister of State will be aware, the Lakes of Killarney have suffered in recent years from algae bloom and unacceptably high levels of phosphates.  This amenity will be lost if a sewage treatment facility is not put in place immediately.</P>
        <P>A sewerage scheme for Waterville has been sanctioned and featured on list after list during the years but funding has been held up in the Department.  As a seaside resort, it is unacceptable that raw sewage is being emitted into the sea at Waterville.  Residents will no longer tolerate this.  We have heard about all the great work done during the Celtic tiger but priorities were misplaced during the period.  It is unacceptable that, despite approval being granted, work has not proceeded on sewerage schemes in an area close to the Lakes of Killarney and in a seaside resort.</P>
        <P>I ask the Department to provide funding to enable Kerry County Council to carry out the required works immediately.  I also request that the Minister include the sewerage schemes for Waterville and Kilcummin in the water services investment programme 2010-12 which is due to be announced this month.  I plead with him to make available this vital funding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for providing me with a timely opportunity to raise this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I thank the Deputy for providing me with an opportunity to clarify the position on Kerry County Council&rsquo;s proposals for water and wastewater facilities for Waterville and wastewater facilities for Kilcummin.</P>
        <P>The Waterville water and sewerage schemes are designed to upgrade the water treatment plant, provide a new wastewater treatment plant and the pipework for both the water and sewerage systems.  The combined schemes were to be procured under two contracts, a pipeline contract and a single contract for the two treatment plants.  The water mains and sewer networks contract is substantially completed.  The two treatment plants are to be procured under a single design-build-operate, DBO, contract.  Kerry County Council has submitted a tender recommendation for the DBO contract to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in which it is under examination.  Agreement has not been reached between the Department and the council on the level of funding to be provided by both the council and the Department for the scheme.  Discussions have taken place, however, and the council is to make a further submission to the Department.  When agreement is reached on the level of funding to be provided by both parties, consideration will be given to allowing the council to proceed with the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Kilcummin sewerage scheme is part of the Lough Leane catchment sewerage scheme which was included in the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2007-09.  Kerry County Council&rsquo;s revised proposals for the Kilcummin scheme are under examination in the Department and a decision will be conveyed to the council as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In common with all local authorities, Kerry County Council was asked to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services in its area to the Department by 23 October 2009.  The Department is finalising the consideration of these assessments which will form a key input to the development of the 2010-12 water services investment programme.  In conducting their assessments local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression in the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.</P><Col N="760"/>
        <P>With the changed economic climate and completion of the first cycle of river basin management plans by local authorities in the near future, there is a greater need than ever to focus on strategic environmental and economic objectives.  The 2010-12 programme will do this by prioritising projects that target public health and environmental compliance issues, support economic and employment growth and offer best value for money.  The Minister expects to publish the 2010-12 water services investment programme shortly and his Department will work closely with Kerry County Council to advance priority schemes identified in the programme.  I hope my reply satisfies the Deputy, whom I thank again for raising the matter.</P>

	<P>I thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter, namely, funding for the repair of the weir and fish pass in Fermoy, County Cork.  I thank, in particular, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, for coming before the House.  I am aware of his personal interest in the matter and that he has visited Fermoy on occasion to familiarise himself with it. </P>
        <P>When I raised this issue approximately one year ago, I was informed that a rock fish ramp was required.  I understand this is no longer the case and the Department&rsquo;s scientific committee has indicated that the number of salmon upstream of the weir is surplus to quota.  Notwithstanding this, the weir in Fermoy needs to be repaired as a matter of urgency.  The fish pass, although adequate, also needs to be repaired.  Funding is required for both projects.</P>
        <P>At long last, a flood relief scheme is being proceeded with in Fermoy.  I hope the new scheme will be as successful as the one in Mallow.  With workers, contractors and the Office of Public Works on the ground, this is an opportune time to carry out repair works on the fish pass and weir.</P>
        <P>I have been asked to bring to the attention of the Minister the concerns of Fermoy Rowing Club.  I have been informed the Minister is aware of these concerns and has walked the Blackwater River and noted the issues that arise.  The rowing club welcomes the proposed implementation of phase 2 of the flood alleviation scheme and is cautiously optimistic that the Office of Public Works will address its needs and concerns.  Initially, the club was assured that the plans to erect a permanent, continuous 1.3 m high wall along the quay from the youth centre to the rowing club were open to qualification.  The erection of such a wall would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the club to place boats on the river during regattas, training sessions and so forth.  The club is seeking the erection of demountable walls or movable gates as part of the barrier to enable rowers to launch boats on the river.  It wants this issue to be addressed in conjunction with the other works being undertaken in the area.</P>
        <P>The minimum requirement is that any proposed permanent structure contain two breaks of at least 75 ft. each to facilitate daily training and the launch of boats during regattas.  This clearance is needed to launch an eight person rowing boat which is 63 ft. in length.  Any new permanent structure would compromise the club&rsquo;s slipway and require it to be extended and renovated.  The rowing club understands from consultations with engineers that its proposals are feasible.  I ask the Minister of State to raise the matter with the Office of Public Works to ensure all the relevant bodies come together.  Fermoy Town Council and residents want these works which are both practical and possible to be carried out, as they would safeguard the rowing club, fish in the river and the beautiful weir, a landmark, of which the people of Fermoy and north County Cork are proud.</P><Col N="761"/>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will discuss this matter with his colleagues.  Let us see sense because it was left unattended for long enough.  The problem has almost been solved.  I hope the Minister of State, with his pragmatic, practical way of doing things, will have the matter sorted out to allow us to move on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this matter.  Protecting and enhancing our inland fisheries is a core objective of our inland fisheries strategy and a requirement of EU law under the habitats directive.  In this regard, I welcome the matter of the weir at Fermoy being raised on the Adjournment.  The weir is in the ownership of Fermoy Town Council.  The council, which acquired the weir some years ago, is responsible, as are other weir owners, for the maintenance and upkeep of the weir.  Following a complaint to the European Commission and technical studies taken thereafter, the town council is aware of the need to reduce the barrier effect of the weir on the migration of certain protected fish species, including salmon and lamprey, to ensure compliance with the EU habitats directive.</P>
        <P>Since taking up responsibility for the inland fisheries brief, I reviewed the approach to resolving the barrier to fish passage at Fermoy up to December 2009.  I was anxious that progress be made to deal with problems of fish passage and actively engaged with the town council on the matter as well as the local rowing club and angling interests in terms of how their needs could also be met.  I listened carefully to the strong arguments of the council, local rowing club and anglers, that an alternative to the rock-ramp proposal would provide a viable solution to the issue of fish passage at Fermoy.</P>
        <P>While the technical and scientific advice to me differs from this position, having listened to the arguments of the council and rowing club, I agreed to afford the council &mdash; which is the owner of the weir &mdash; an opportunity to implement its own preferred solution of repairing the existing fish passes on the weir.  I also made it abundantly clear that if that solution did not work, I would have no alternative &mdash; indeed, no hesitation &mdash; in requiring the rock-ramp proposal to proceed.</P>
        <P>To give practical effect to my decision, I exercised my power to revoke the original direction issued in 2006, in favour of the order given to the Fermoy Town Council, under section 116 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, to undertake immediate repairs to the existing damaged fish ladder situated in the weir to reduce the barrier effect of the weir on migratory fish species.</P>
        <P>In light of my discussions with the European Commission authorities, having listened to the council, the rowing club and the anglers &mdash; and having had the advice of the Attorney General, as the chief legal adviser to the Government &mdash; I came to the conclusion that affording the council an opportunity to explore its preferred solution to repair the existing fish ladder is the appropriate immediate action.  This will obviously need to be monitored closely from a fish passage perspective.  I hope the council will work closely with local or regional fisheries officers to ensure that the optimum result is obtained.  All parties involved must, however, appreciate that Ireland is a member of the European Union and thus committed to meeting its responsibilities under EU law, including obligations on biodiversity, and in particular to protection of species and habitats under the habitats directive.</P>
        <P>I have created an opportunity for the council to demonstrate that its preferred solution to repair the fish pass offers a viable solution to the issue of fish passage at Fermoy.  This opportunity has been provided to the council notwithstanding the technical advice to me and it is now a matter for Fermoy Town Council, the owners of the weir, to implement its proposals and monitor their effectiveness.  In creating this opportunity, I stress there is no dilution of <Col N="762"/>Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to meeting its responsibilities under EU law, including obligations on protected species under the habitats directive.</P>
        <P>The effect of the repairs proposed on fish migration will be closely monitored and if the required improvement in fish migration is not achieved, I will not hesitate to direct the town council to undertake further major works.</P>
        <P>I understand that the works on the weir do not contribute to the separate flood relief project.  The costs are therefore not attributable or appropriate to that project, which is being funded and managed by the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>The onus rests with the local authority to maintain the structure it values and protects so zealously, in the same way that it funds and maintains other important infrastructure in its ownership.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office for selecting this important local matter for discussion on the Adjournment.  Everyone associated with Shanbally National School was deeply disappointed that the school was not included in the recent announcement by the Minister for Education and Science concerning the schools building programme.  That disappointment must be understood in the context that the application for the extension was initially made to the Department in June 2001. </P>
        <P>Shanbally National School is currently operating on a site of approximately 1.65 acres.  It is an old school building with a number of portakabins on the site.  The original building was developed in 1964 as a three-teacher school.  The school currently has eight main-stream classrooms, as well as a special speech and language class.  Some 220 pupils attend the school, but the vast majority of those have to attend classes in the portakabins.  The main building accommodates just three mainstream classes, a school office and a general purpose room.  The remaining five mainstream classes, as well as the special speech and language class, currently operate in nine portakabins on the site.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight the costs involved in this case.  The annual rent for the portkabins is about &euro;100,000 which is a significant sum for an eight-classroom school.  I acknowledge that the Minister has made good progress nationally in reducing the costs associated with renting temporary portkabins on school sites.  However, he should examine this case in Shanbally where that annual investment of &euro;100,000 could be put to better use by providing a permanent extension to the school building, which is what is required.  The school has a band of 2.2 which needs to be upgraded.  The key issue is that Shanbally should be recognised as a developing area, given its proximity to Carrigaline where I live.  It is a large and expanding satellite town.  In recent <Col N="763"/>times, local schools have been under some pressure to accommodate the number of children coming through the system.</P>
        <P>Enrolment at Shanbally has doubled since 2000 when it had only 126 pupils.  That growth has been entirely predictable, given the level of development in Carrigaline and the spillover effect which has reached Shanbally National School.  I wish to highlight the comparison with other schools in the area.  For example, Ballygarvan is deemed to be a developing area and it, too, has a similar mixture of pupils from the village of Ballygarvan itself, as well as pupils from Carrigaline.  In the case of Shanbally, the Department has agreed with the long-term projected enrolment so that it will remain a school of eight mainstream classes.</P>
        <P>The school has submitted its own proposal whereby a builder would construct the extension and lease it back to the Department over a 24-year period.  That design work was completed by O&rsquo;Shea Leader consultants.  The Minister for Education and Science is familiar with this school, having represented the constituency for a long time.  He has advanced a number of other projects in the constituency.</P>
        <P>Shanbally is a very deserving case.  I pay tribute to Mr. Liam Shanahan, the principal, and his staff, for working in difficult conditions.  I hope the Minister will find a suitable avenue to advance this essential project, whether it be through the permanent accommodation scheme or the capital building programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, who, unfortunately, cannot be present.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the D&aacute;il the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Modernising facilities in our existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  All applications for capital funding are assessed by the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting, based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity etc., leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.</P>
        <P>As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4 the lowest.  Band 1 projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists, but there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band 4 project makes provision of desirable, but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities, such as a library or new sports hall.</P>
        <P>Due to industrial action on the part of some staff in the Department of Education and Science, I am not in a position to give full details of the school referred to by the Deputy.  However, the school&rsquo;s application is listed on the Department of Education and Science website with a band 2 rating.  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, on 16 February last, the Minister for Education and Science made an announcement regarding a total of 52 projects <Col N="764"/>which are to proceed to tender and construction.  Some 25 of these projects have already secured planning permission and have been approved to proceed to tender and construction this year.  The remaining projects have not yet secured planning permission.  When they have secured this planning permission, they will then be in a position to prepare their tender documents and proceed to tender and construction, either later this year or in 2011.  The project for the school in question was not included in this announcement.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department&rsquo;s capital budget.  This project will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and wish him luck.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 67 together.</P>
        <P>The establishment of a &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; is one of the commitments in the Next Generation Broadband policy paper &ldquo;Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland&rdquo;, which I published in June last year.</P>
        <P>The concept of a &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; arose from a recognition that there is added value to be had from facilitating telecoms operators in gaining access to ducting in State-owned networks, thereby ensuring optimal use of State assets and facilitating more cost-effective roll out of broadband.  The context to the proposal is the anticipated increase in demand for high speed broadband into the future.</P>
        <P>My Department has had consultations with the telecoms operators and has also engaged with the relevant State Bodies which are generally supportive of the proposal.  My Department has also undertaken an initial survey of State-owned networks and has published a series of maps showing the routes of infrastructure such as roads, electricity, gas and rail.</P><Col N="766"/>
        <P>A further development in progressing the thinking behind the concept has been the publication of the Premium Rate Services Bill, which contains an amendment to the Communications (Regulation) Act 2002 whereby the National Roads Authority will provide a formal framework to make ducts on national roads and motorways accessible to telecommunications companies.  This Bill, which has cleared all stages in the D&aacute;il and Seanad will be back before this House tomorrow and I anticipate that it will be quickly enacted.</P>
        <P>The immediate objective is to have information on the availability of and access arrangements for all State-owned ducting via a single contact point later this year.  My Department is in discussion with ComReg in this regard.</P>
        <P>At the same time we will evaluate and progress the best management system that will in the future provide coordinated access to such State-owned ducting.</P>
        <P>Such a management system should facilitate our wider objective of promoting cooperation between different telecoms providers of backhaul and wholesale services while at the same time not undermining competition in the market.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 88 together.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has statutory responsibility for grid connection offers and for oversight of EirGrid&rsquo;s grid connection process including the Gate process for renewable energy.</P>
        <P>There is currently over 1,500 megawatts (MWs) of renewable generation capacity connected to the electricity grid.  Wind powered technology is the dominant renewable technology.  Over 100 individual windfarms have been connected with a combined capacity of 1,260 MWs.  240 MWs of hydro-power are connected.  The balance represents biomass plants mainly landfill gas.</P>
        <P>The contribution from renewable energy connected to the electricity grid is increasing very steadily from year to year.  Renewable generation contributed 11.9% of all electricity consumed in 2008 compared to just 4.4% in 2003.  Renewable generation in 2009 is estimated to have represented 14% of all generation consumed.  Ireland is on schedule to meet the 15% target for electricity from renewable sources in 2010.</P>
        <P>In addition to projects already built and connected, a further 1400 MWs of capacity have already signed grid connection offers from the Gate 1 and Gate 2 processes and will be built and connected to the grid over the next two or three year period.</P>
        <P>The CER and EirGrid previously estimated that around 5,800 megawatts (MWs) of renewable capacity will be required in total to deliver the 40% target in 2020.  If the downward trend in electricity consumption continues the prospects for exceeding the 40% target increases.</P><Col N="767"/>
        <P>The CER decision on the &lsquo;Gate 3&rsquo; round provides for connection offers for an additional 4,000 MWs of renewable electricity capacity.  Approximately 90% of these offers are wind powered capacity including around 800 MW of offshore wind.  The Gate 3 decisions, combined with existing renewable capacity and projects currently being built and connected, point to the 40% target being met and even exceeded by 2020.  Ireland&rsquo;s National Renewable Energy Action Plan, which is to be submitted to the EU Commission by next June, will set out the detailed projections and strategies to achieve the national target.  The plan is being developed in consultation with the renewable sector and all stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The projects in Gate 3 were selected by the CER on a &ldquo;first come first served&rdquo; criterion.  Grid connection offers for projects within the Gate 3 process began to issue in December last year.  They continue to be issued on a phased basis until mid 2011.</P>
        <P>To ensure this process operates efficiently and to keep the industry informed of developments, the CER has established a Gate 3 Liaison Group involving all stakeholders, including EirGrid and the renewable industry associations.  The objective is to ensure the connection offer process is completed quickly, transparently and effectively.</P>
        <P>The Gate 3 process was extensively consulted on by the CER.  Through public consultation and dedicated industry workshops, all industry stakeholders were given the opportunity of responding in advance to the proposed connection process.</P>
        <P>Once the level of take up of Gate 3 offers becomes clear, the CER will decide how to address any issues arising.</P>
        <P>A strategic framework to deliver on the potential for exporting renewable electricity from Ireland is also a key priority.  This will take account of grid technology developments, power flow management techniques and progressive interconnection with the UK and potentially Europe.  In that context Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the North Seas Countries Offshore Grid Initiative and involvement in other EU offshore wind fora will ensure that Ireland is at the forefront of European developments in offshore renewable energy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 69 together.</P>
        <P>My Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General has been working to progress a scheme to provide for the recovery of carbon windfall gains from electricity generators to the end of the current EU Emissions Trading Scheme in 2012.  Under the current Emissions Trading Scheme there is a free allocation of carbon credits to electricity generators.</P>
        <P>The Single Electricity Market Committee has statutory responsibility for the operation of the all island electricity market.  The Committee decided in 2008 that the full costs of the free carbon allocations should be passed through to the market. This has been a cause of consider<Col N="768"/>able concern to business because of the impact on the wholesale cost of electricity. Business Groups have also expressed concerns about the related carbon windfall profits earned by electricity generators.  These concerns have been raised consistently in the context of energy costs for business and their impact on competitiveness.</P>
        <P>In July last year the Government agreed a series of measures to mitigate where possible energy costs for business.  As part of those measures the Government decided to progress the introduction of legislation to recover carbon windfall gains from generators up to 2012.</P>
        <P>There are legal, technical and other complex considerations inherent in any potential treatment of carbon windfall gains.  My Department has been working to comprehensively address all these considerations in finalising proposals for the drafting of legislation. I can advise the Deputy that the Government have today approved my proposals to draft legislation on the implementation of a carbon windfall levy.  My Department will be working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to finalise the draft legislative provision with a view to its publication shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 99 together.</P>
        <P>My Department entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) in late December 2008.  Since then, 3 has progressed its network rollout and NBS broadband services are now available in almost half of the 1,028 designated Electoral Divisions (ED) to be covered under the Scheme.  Under the NBS contract, all EDs in the NBS Coverage Area are required to have broadband connectivity by end September 2010.</P>
        <P>It is accepted that even after the full roll-out of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) there will still be a small percentage of premises outside of the Electoral Divisions covered by the scheme that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  In this context, my Department is currently considering the detailed design and implementation of a scheme which would utilise these funds to address the issue of broadband availability to unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.</P>
        <P>One of the key issues to be resolved in adopting a scheme to address this issue is the identification of potential beneficiaries under the scheme.  The scheme can apply only in rural areas <Col N="769"/>and can not apply to those areas already covered by the NBS.  The scheme will also not be available to people who already have a service available to them.</P>
        <P>My Department will be consulting with existing Internet Service Providers to ensure that the scheme does not encroach on their existing customer base.</P>
        <P>It is hoped to commence the scheme this year with the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  State Aid approval has been granted by the European Commission as part of the overall process of securing the necessary approvals and funding for the scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is a highly efficient way of generating on-site heat and electricity simultaneously. It can offer significantly reduced energy bills for the end user and is a particularly efficient form of energy generation as it minimises any transmission losses involved in getting power to the site.</P>
        <P>Traditionally, CHP plants were only used in large industrial units with a high on-site heat load.  Increasingly the technology is developing higher efficiency, smaller scale units that are capable of servicing smaller buildings and residential houses.</P>
        <P>As this technology becomes more common in the market, smaller commercial premises, public buildings, can now reduce their energy costs by installing CHP systems.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), administers the Deployment Programme for CHP technologies.  The programme was expanded in 2008 to include dedicated support for Biomass and Anaerobic Digestion powered CHP.</P>
        <P>Under the SEI Support Programme a significant number of Public Buildings have taken advantage of the benefits of CHP, or are currently in the process of doing so.  These include academic institutions which have installed CHP systems, with a total electrical capacity of 850 kilowatts. Two more institutions are in the process of installing systems with an electrical capacity of 750 kilowatts.</P>
        <P>In the Health sector, 5 hospitals have already installed CHP systems with a total electrical capacity of 770 kilowatts. 3 Local Authorities have also installed systems with an electrical capacity of 350 kilowatts, with one more in construction.</P>
        <P>The Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat), which incentivises the installation of biomass boilers, is also open to institutional users of heat, and has already supported the construction of a number of projects.</P>
        <P>Taken together, CHP technologies and the projects supported by Reheat offer real solutions to energy costs in these public buildings by reducing the cost of power and increasing the overall energy efficiency of the buildings.</P>
        <P>There are particular challenges for Ireland in achieving significant CHP penetration given our dispersed low density population and the characteristics of the built environment.  The improvements in CHP technology and the ongoing work of SEI with the Public Sector and industry will help us to overcome the challenges.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 93 together. </P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Act 2009, responsibility for certain foreshore functions transferred to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with effect from 15 January last.  This includes all energy related developments (including oil, gas, wind, wave and tidal energy) on the foreshore.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Minister Gormley, has made clear that he will introduce legislative change aimed at better integrating the foreshore consent processes with the planning processes under the Planning Acts.  This will include the new planning regime for offshore renewable energy developments, taking account of the National Offshore Renewable Energy Plan which is to be submitted by my Department to the EU Commission by next June.  My Department is working closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the new regime that will reflect national and EU renewable energy objectives while taking account of the interests of stakeholders in the marine resource.</P>
        <P>Both Departments will work with the Department of Finance, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and other relevant Departments as well as EirGrid, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), in the delivery of the new regime.</P>
        <P>A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of Irish offshore renewable energy resources is being undertaken by the SEI at my Department&rsquo;s request.  This will complement and inform the design of the new offshore framework.  The SEA process is being overseen by a steering group comprising my Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, SEI and the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P>I intend to bring forward shortly a policy blueprint for the development of the renewable energy offshore resource encompassing ocean and wind energy.  Ireland&rsquo;s National Offshore Renewable Energy Plan to be submitted to the EU Commission by next June will include our plans for offshore renewable energy.  It will also take account of the significant impetus being given to offshore renewable energy at European level.  Our work as part of the North Seas Countries Offshore Initiative together with the forthcoming EU Strategic Energy Review will focus on the priority interconnection needs across Member States.  The Plan will also reflect ongoing co-operation with the UK and Northern Ireland through the ISLES project and under the British-Irish Council.</P>
        <P>I look forward to meeting with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security in the coming weeks to set out my vision for the renewable energy resource and the actions underway to deliver on the potential including a fit for purpose planning regime.</P>

	<P>I strongly favour open access to private and public telecoms infrastructure.  I believe that such access can increase competition, drive down prices and encourage investment.  </P>
        <P>The question of ensuring access to telecoms infrastructure is a matter for ComReg as part of its function of regulating the telecoms markets in accordance with the requirements of the EU Regulatory Framework for electronic communications.  ComReg is independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions and is required by law to exercise its powers impartially and transparently.</P>
        <P>Under the Access Directive of the EU Regulatory Framework, ComReg is required to ensure access and interconnection between telecommunications operators in order to promote efficiency, sustainable competition and give the maximum benefit to end users.  These are legal obligations under EU and national law, which ComReg is required to enforce.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome recent decisions by ComReg to make the cost of access to the infrastructure of the dominant telecommunications player more competitive.</P>
        <P>There are a number of telecom networks which are owned by the State or by commercial State bodies that are available to telecom service providers on an open-access basis.</P>
        <P>Eighty-seven Metropolitan Area Networks constructed by my Department, in conjunction with Local and Regional Authorities, offering dark fibre and managed services are available on an open access basis to all service providers.  There are currently 35 service providers using the MANs in some of these locations.</P>
        <P>ESB Telecoms (ESBT) has built over 1,300kms of optical fibre network, which was grant-aided by my Department from Exchequer and European Regional Development Funds.  ESBT offers dark fibre and managed bandwidth services to any service provider requiring backhaul connectivity on their network.</P>
        <P>Aurora Telecom, a Division of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, offers dark fibre on its network to service providers on an open-access basis.</P>
        <P>The importance of open access for competition in the telecommunications market has been continuously highlighted by me in policy statements governing electronic communications, most recently in my policy paper &ldquo;Next Generation Broadband &mdash; Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland&rdquo;.</P>

        <P>The European Commission has set 2012 as the timeline for analogue switch off throughout Europe and the EU Council of Ministers has asked Member States to, as far as possible, complete the switchover in 2012.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 70 together.</P>
        <P>Electric vehicles offer an increasingly realistic solution in terms of reducing the Greenhouse Gas Emissions in transport while at the same time tackling Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imported fossil fuels.  There is very significant global investment under way in research and development in this area.  The technology is now maturing to a point where large scale commercial deployment appears feasible in the short to medium term.  The range of new car models by virtually all motor manufacturers recently revealed at the recent Frankfurt Motor Show underlines the rapidity and scale of the technology shift.</P>
        <P>Ireland needs to be at the forefront of developments and we are working to ensure this with all stakeholders.  We have set a target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020, which will equate to around 225,000 cars on Irish roads.</P>
        <P>The challenge is to develop economically viable options for the cost efficient build, operation and maintenance of an electric vehicle infrastructure network in Ireland.  Incentivisation is also needed to develop a market for electric vehicles.</P><Col N="773"/>
        <P>ESB networks are proactively developing plans for an electric vehicle infrastructure network and are taking a lead role in Europe to ensure that EU utilities work together to progress standardisation.  I am working with my colleague the Minister for Finance to put in place the incentives to support electric vehicles as announced on Budget Day.</P>
        <P>The Memorandum of Understanding concluded by the ESB and my Department with Renault-Nissan is designed to support knowledge transfer on the infrastructure requirements of electric vehicles.  It will also ensure that Ireland is one of the first countries to be supplied with both Renault and Nissan electric cars.  This represents a major opportunity for Ireland.  Under the Memorandum of Understanding ESB Networks is able to avail of data on developments in electric vehicles which is informing consideration of optimum infrastructure, support mechanisms and the potential benefits accruing.  The Memorandum of Understanding does not convey any exclusive rights in relation to the provision of electric cars.  Ireland is open for business to all manufacturers of electric vehicles and I want to build relationships with all global players in the sector.</P>
        <P>My Department and the ESB are currently in discussions with other motor manufacturers with a view to developing additional Memoranda of Understanding and there are a number of promising prospects for later this year, which will contribute to ensuring choice of supply.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 102 together.</P>
        <P>Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the development of free-to-air and commercial digital terrestrial television (DTT) in Ireland and for the closure of the national analogue TV network.</P>
        <P>On foot of this requirement, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) predecessor, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI), launched a competition, which is still ongoing.  As the Deputy is aware, the highest placed consortium in the competition withdrew from the process last April.  Negotiations then commenced with the next placed bidder and this process is continuing.</P>
        <P>As I stated recently in response to previous questions on this issue, I am not prepared to speculate on the outcome of the commercial DTT process, which is a matter for the BAI, an independent regulatory authority.  Nor am I prepared to surmise on the ongoing negotiations between the BAI, RT&Eacute; and the OneVision consortium.  I have, however, made clear my view that I would like to see this process concluded as soon as possible.</P><Col N="774"/>
        <P>The conclusion of the process is essential to provide certainty for broadcasters, suppliers and the general public with regard to the development of commercial DTT services in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Under section 129 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 RT&Eacute; is required to ensure that &lsquo;free-to-air&rsquo; DTT is available to approximately 90% of the population on such date as may be specified by the Minister.  I signed an Order last week specifying this date as 31st October 2010.</P>
        <P>The Act also requires RT&Eacute; to provide a national &lsquo;free to air&rsquo; digital service with capacity to carry RT&Eacute; 1, RTE 2, TG4 and TV3 by the end of 2011 or such later date as I may specify.  I have written to RTE informing them that the date for provision of a national service is 31 December 2011.</P>
        <P>As I have previously stated, my policy objective is the earliest possible switch-off of the analogue TV system operated by RT&Eacute;NL and it is my intention that this will be no later that quarter four 2012. The timely switch-off of analogue broadcast services will release valuable spectrum and will position Ireland to maximise the benefits of the resulting digital dividend.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 86 together.</P>
        <P>I have stated on a number of occasions commitment to the early provision of a legislative framework for the exploration for and development of geothermal energy.  Accordingly, in the course of 2009, drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill with a view to producing Heads in early 2010 has been prioritised in the Department, with detailed legislative drafting to follow by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.  Considerable progress has been made in this regard and I am currently considering an initial proposal for Heads, which I would hope to bring to Government in the near future, seeking approval to send these forward for drafting a Bill on Geothermal Energy for publication later this year.</P>
        <P>I have pointed out on a number of occasions that geothermal energy is a new area of legislative endeavour in this jurisdiction and the Bill will be expected to be substantial, dealing with a range of matters such as ownership of the resource, regulation and licensing of exploration and development, ancillary rights and protection of third party interests.  I would add that I have engaged closely with industry and interested parties in a series of meetings and workshops to ensure legislative proposals have the benefit of their input.</P>

	<P>My Department, and others, have been working, and continue to work, on addressing the digital divide with a range of measures to promote digital engagement.</P>
        <P>One issue has been access to the technology and infrastructure &mdash; which is being addressed both by the market and, in the case of areas where broadband provision remains an issue, through the National Broadband Scheme, in which my Department is investing substantially.</P>
        <P>The issue of skills is being addressed in several ways.  Training opportunities are being provided by community, voluntary and not for profit organisations across the country.  My Department&rsquo;s <b>Bene</b><i>f</i><b>IT</b> e-Inclusion grant schemes are assisting many of these initiatives.</P>
        <P>Under the <b>Bene</b><i>f</i><b>IT</b> schemes, 89 grants were awarded in 2008 and 2009 &mdash; amounting to approximately &euro;2.58 million.  A review of the outputs from the <b>Bene</b><i>f</i><b>IT</b> 1 scheme has commenced.  It will, inter alia, determine the number of people trained under the scheme, and will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website when completed later this year.  Approximately 7,400 training places are available under the <b>Bene</b><i>f</i><b>IT</b> 2 scheme this year.  Training throughout 2010 is taking place in venues across the country.   Details of the training, the locations and contact <Col N="777"/>information for the training providers are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.eInclusion.ie</P>
        <P>There are, of course, other training opportunities available from a variety of sources &mdash; including opportunities in libraries and in night classes throughout the country, and from a range of private sector training providers.

	<P>The entry into the domestic electricity market last year of two new suppliers, Airtricity and Bord G&aacute;is Energy, demonstrates that policy to encourage competition in electricity generation and supply is paying dividends for consumers.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is Energy and Airtricity are offering discounts of between 10% and 14% on ESB unit rates which are still regulated.  They are also offering domestic consumers alternative billing arrangements and options for the level of renewable electricity they purchase.</P>
        <P>Energy price regulation is designed to ensure that a dominant player cannot engage in uncompetitive, short-term pricing practices, which could undermine or drive out emerging competition.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has made it clear that the regulation of ESB tariffs will discontinue when competition has taken firm hold in the market.</P>
        <P>The CER is now working with ESB and with the other players in the market as well as consumer and business groups, to develop a timeframe for deregulation of the regulated ESB tariffs through the emergence of competition of scale.  On 2nd December last, the CER pub<Col N="778"/>lished its paper for consultation on the timing and conditions under which regulation of prices should be discontinued for ESB Customer Supply.  The CER is also consulting on other actions to be taken, apart from the removal of the price control, in order to ensure a fully competitive deregulated electricity retail market.  The closing date for submissions on the CER&rsquo;s consultation paper was 1st February last.  I understand the CER received a wide range of submissions which are now being analysed.  A clear roadmap and timeframe for retail electricity deregulation for domestic customers as well as SMEs will result from this process in the coming months.</P>

	<P>While the provision of broadband services, particularly in urban areas, is a matter for private sector service providers, my overall policy framework is aimed at encouraging wider availability and higher speed services.</P>
        <P>Broadband policy is set out in the paper that I launched in June 2009.  This paper set out the basic policy framework that investment in broadband, including Next Generation Networks (NGN) which provide higher speeds, is primarily a matter for the market facilitated by an appropriate regulatory regime.  Direct State investment is aimed at market failure situations, for example, the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which is aimed at bringing a basic broadband product to unserved areas.</P>
        <P>The availability, take up and quality of broadband in Ireland have all increased substantially over recent years.  Large corporates throughout Ireland are fully served.  SME and residential broadband has also improved significantly over recent years.  Any remaining areas of Ireland that do not currently have a broadband service (i.e. now estimated at under 4% of the premises in Ireland) will have one through the NBS by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>At the end of September 2009, just over 70% of Irish homes, and over 86% of SMEs, had subscribed for a broadband connection.  As regards broadband speeds, most of the homes (68.4%) and the SMEs (72.8%) are using higher speed broadband (2mbps &mdash; 10mbps).</P>

	<P>While the regulation of natural gas tariffs is the responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is statutorily independent in the performance of its functions, the Commission has no function in regard to the setting of tariffs for domestic gas cylinders, or LPG, which is a by-product of oil.  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is no price control on petroleum products in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The transportation and supply of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is not licensed under the Energy Acts and neither my Department nor the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) have any role in the regulation of LPG transportation and supply.</P><Col N="779"/>
        <P>Section 14 of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, enables the CER&rsquo;s responsibilities to be extended to cover the activities of LPG undertakings and installers with respect to safety.  Following legal advice indicating that amendments were required to this provision of the legislation, the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill includes a number of amendments in order to incorporate LPG and LPG installers into the natural gas safety regulatory system and to further provide that the CER assume responsibility for LPG safety.  The Bill was introduced in the Seanad and has recently passed Second Stage.</P>
        <P>These current legislative proposals represent Phase I of a two phase legislative approach. The matter of addressing identified gaps in relation to LPG Distribution Networks and reporting of LPG-related incidents requires further detailed examination and consultation with both industry and the Health and Safety Authority in order to ensure that among other things there is no duplication of responsibilities.</P>
        <P>The CER has recently published a consultation document on these issues.  The outcome of that consultation will inform Phase II legislative proposals.  There are no plans to extend the role of the CER in relation to LPG beyond the safety role.</P>

	<P>Government policy pertaining to the electronic communications market in Ireland is set out in &ldquo;Next Generation Broadband &mdash; Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland&rdquo;, which I published in June 2009.  The policy paper was developed in accordance with various key principles, which are crucial to the development of the market including (i) competition, at platform and service levels, which drives innovation and investment, (ii) investment certainty for service providers considering investing in network infrastructure, (iii) investment intervention by Government to bridge any digital divide in cases of market failure and to meet certain of the State&rsquo;s own communication needs, and (iv) appropriate regulation.  The policy paper sets out the Government&rsquo;s position that investment in broadband infrastructure is primarily a matter for the private sector, facilitated, where appropriate and possible, by Government (e.g. by providing access to State owned infrastructure).</P>
        <P>Existing policy has facilitated significant progress in broadband roll out and broadband speeds over recent years and my focus will be on continuing implementation of this policy.  I welcome all plans by service providers across different platforms to invest in high-speed broadband and will ensure that the State provides a supportive environment for such investment.</P>

	<P>The report referred to by the Deputy examines the distribution of private sector capital investment over the previous decade.  It highlights the excessive concentration of such investment in the housing sector and calls for an increased distribution of future capital investment in core activities that would enhance national productive capacity.  The report accords with my policy paper &ldquo;Next Generation Broadband &mdash; Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland&rdquo;, published in June 2009, <Col N="781"/>which aims to facilitate private sector capital investment in electronic communications infrastructure.</P>
        <P>I would to point out that there has in fact been significant private investment in telecommunications infrastructure, especially broadband, in recent years.  This has led to a major investment in our broadband infrastructure across the different platforms of fixed line, cable and mobile.  As a result, broadband coverage has been greatly extended and speeds have increased.  This private investment has been complemented by State investment in cases of market failure such as the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  These developments are reflected in recent improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s international position on broadband provision.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the progress made to date on the implementation of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan which was published in 2009; the position regarding the target of 20% energy efficiency savings across the economy by 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[10133/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) sets out 90 actions that Government is either already taking or will take in the period to 2020 to achieve the national energy efficiency targets of 20% across the economy and 33% in the public sector.  The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately &euro;1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.</P>
        <P>The key NEEAP actions undertaken to date are as follows:</P>
        <P>The Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme, which is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), was launched in March 2009.  The scheme provides grant assistance to homeowners for energy efficiency retro-fitting measures including attic and wall insulation, very high-efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.</P>
        <P>The scheme is open to anybody owning a house that was built prior to 2006.  Homeowners can expect to save up to &euro;700 per year on their energy bills if they install the full suite of measures available under the scheme.  The scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the typical cost of energy efficiency upgrade measures, depending on the measure concerned.  The scheme had attracted 40,724 applications by the end of December 2009.  In total, 33,434 energy efficient measures were installed in 18,183 homes in 2009.</P>
        <P>The Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) provides support for low income housing for insulation and other energy efficiency improvement measures.  This scheme is also managed by SEI and implemented by local community groups.  Measures include cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, boiler lagging jackets, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs).  These measures are provided free or at a nominal cost to the householder.  Advice is also provided on minimising energy use.  Some &euro;20 million was provided for the scheme in 2009, which included a contribution of &euro;5 million from ESB and BGE.  This enabled energy efficiency improvements to be made in over 19,000 vulnerable homes in 2009, effectively doubling the total number of homes benefiting under the scheme in the previous ten years.</P>
        <P>In the business sector, the most significant cost-cutting and energy saving potential lies in improving the energy performance requirements of new non-residential buildings, improvement of existing buildings, encouraging more businesses and public bodies to actively address their energy use and to use the most energy efficient plant, machinery and equipment.  In 2009, SEI delivered a &euro;5 million programme that provided grant assistance to the business and public <Col N="782"/>sectors.  The programme supports energy efficiency measures for businesses and institutions across the country.  Over 74 projects have been funded under the programme.  As a result of the work carried out, annual energy savings worth &euro;2.6 million and 12kt CO2 where achieved.</P>
        <P>SEI also ran a &euro;1.3m support programme providing energy assessments and training to local authorities and other public sector agencies.  This has resulted in savings worth between &euro;1.2M and &euro;1.8M in 2009.  A range of best practice guides were also developed and an energy efficiency design process initiated to incorporate energy efficiency principles into the design of new or retrofitted public sector services.  Regulations introduced in December 2009 require all public bodies to include, in its annual reports published after January 1st next year, a statement describing the actions it is taking to improve its energy efficiency, together with an assessment of the energy savings arising from those actions.  SEI is currently finalising the methodology for calculating energy savings across the public sector.</P>
        <P>For 2010, a dedicated public sector programme will build on the work of 2009.  The Energy Efficiency in the Public Sector Programme will be the main delivery mechanism for energy efficiency actions by public sector bodies.  In addition to the services provided in 2009, areas to be supported in 2010 include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Developing Energy Service Company (ESC) led models under new the National Retrofit programme, outlined in the Budget</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Assisting public sector bodies in the development of 2020 energy efficiency strategies to 2020</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Working in partnership with all Departments in relation to energy efficient design and procurement.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Regulations have also been finalised to give effect to the EU Energy Efficiency Directive that include new energy efficient public procurement rules.  These new rules will require public bodies to purchase or lease only plant and equipment across a diverse range of technologies that are listed on SEI&rsquo;s database of highly energy efficient products.  This database has already been developed as part of the Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) Scheme for energy efficient technologies.</P>
        <P>SEI is also required under the regulations with producing general guidelines on energy efficient procurement and these will be progressed in conjunction with the new OPW National Public Procurement Office and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The ACA scheme was expanded in 2009 to take account of additional categories including energy efficient IT infrastructure and electric vehicles.  Companies can now write off the full capital cost of energy efficient equipment in the year of purchase.  The ACA scheme currently covers equipment accounting for at least 60% of the energy used by industry in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In compliance with the 2006 and 2008 Building Regulations, it is also the policy of Office of Public Works (OPW) that it will conduct feasibility studies on the utilisation of renewable energy technologies in all new buildings over 1,000m2 as part of the design process.</P>
        <P>The OPW has already installed a number of biomass boiler systems and Solar Panel systems in both new and existing buildings where it has been shown to be both technically and economically feasible.  OPW will continue to take this approach.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has recently prioritised work through the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Board to establish achievable targets <Col N="783"/>for reductions in primary energy and CO2 emissions for buildings in all sectors of the economy including public sector buildings, with a view to upgrading the requirements in Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations in 2010.  The work programme currently under way will inform the development of a programme for continuous improvement in Part L requirements in coming years with a view to achieving a Carbon Neutral building standard for buildings other than dwellings, including civic buildings, by 2016.</P>
        <P>SEI&rsquo;s Large Industry Energy Network (LIEN) continues to engage with the largest energy using enterprises (in manufacturing and services) where the 120 member companies collectively spend over &euro;800 million per annum on energy.  Recently published analysis shows that by spending &euro;1.9 million these companies avoided energy costs of &euro;60 million in 2008 alone.</P>
        <P>The National Energy Retrofit Programme, announced on Budget Day, will further reduce energy costs and carbon emissions in homes and business while also creating employment and developing a sustainable market for energy services in Ireland.  The detailed design and specification of the new programme is being finalised by my Department and SEI.  The Programme will be the subject of a public consultation shortly.  In broad terms the Retrofit Programme will bring together the HES Scheme and the WHS as well as the support programme for business and the public sector.  It will also involve the development and promotion of energy services by the energy companies.</P>
        <P>This new Programme has the potential to be the most innovative, ambitious, energy-related initiative ever introduced in Ireland.  It will significantly reduce CO2 emissions and contribute to meeting the national efficiency targets including the target of 33% set for the public sector.  It will also create significant employment in the energy and construction sectors in support of economic renewal.</P>

The development of the EU biofuel sustainability criteria regime was overseen by a special ad hoc Committee, which comprised all Member States and the Commission.  My Department participated in the work of the committee.  The sustainability criteria are duly reflected in the Renewable Energy Directive which sets a 10% target for renewable energy in transport for all Member States by 2020.  The Commission is finalising its detailed guidance document on the implementation of the sustainability criteria including reporting and verification requirements which will be critical to successful implementation.  The Commission&rsquo;s guidelines are expected to be finalised and published later this month.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 98 together.</P>
        <P>The regulation of telecommunications service providers, including regulatory issues<b> </b>surrounding network coverage and quality is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), in accordance with its functions under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, as amended, and the EU Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications. The framework applies in all EU Member States.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications and broadband services is a matter for electronic communications service providers who operate in a fully liberated market, regulated by the ComReg. In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where appropriate and possible.</P>
        <P>Government policy pertaining to the electronic communications market in Ireland is set out in &ldquo;Next Generation Broadband &mdash; Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland&rdquo;, which I published in June 2009.</P>
        <P>There has been significant progress in broadband roll out and broadband quality over recent years.  According to ComReg&rsquo;s latest Quarterly Report for Q3/2009, 68% of residential subscriptions in Ireland and 72% of non-residential subscriptions are in the 2 &mdash; 10 Mbps range.  Only 21% of the non residential subscriptions and only 24% of the residential subscriptions are in the 1 &mdash; 2 Mbps range.  Higher speeds, in some cases up to 50Mbps, are also available to residential and SME customers in urban areas.  For example, speeds of up to 24Mbps are available from DSL providers, 50Mbps products are available from fibre operators and 20Mbps products are available from cable operators.</P>
        <P>In terms of fixed and mobile broadband penetration Ireland now ranks 11th out of the EU 27 and is ahead of the EU 27 average. It is notable also that telecoms prices in Ireland have fallen 40% in real terms over the past decade.</P><Col N="785"/>
        <P>The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer service on a commercial basis. In the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), 3 is progressing its network roll-out and NBS broadband services are now available in almost half of the 1,028 designated Electoral Divisions (ED) to be covered under the Scheme.  Under the NBS contract, all EDs in the NBS Coverage Area are required to have broadband connectivity by end September 2010.</P>
        <P>It is accepted that even after the full roll-out of the NBS there will still be a small percentage of premises outside of the Electoral Divisions covered by the scheme that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  In this context, my Department is currently considering the detailed design and implementation of a scheme which would utilise these funds to address the issue of broadband availability to unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.</P>

	<P>Under Public Financial Procedures, up to 10% of any given year&rsquo;s capital allocation can be carried forward if unspent.  In relation to the 2009 allocation, my Department carried forward &euro;15.721m into 2010.  These funds were allocated between the ICT Programme (&euro;14.290m) and the Energy Research Programme (&euro;1.431m).  The remainder of the unspent 2009 allocation was remitted to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>I would point out to the Deputy that the bulk of the allocation for energy programmes in 2009 related to demand led schemes and it is difficult to accurately predict take up of these, particularly in relation to new schemes.  Notwithstanding the underspend in 2009, there were considerable achievements across sustainable energy programmes overseen by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI).  The Home Energy Savings Scheme, which was operational from April 2009, received 40,727 applications, and paid for 33,434 measures across 18,183 homes.  Expenditure in 2009 amounted to &euro;18.81m.  The scheme has already received over 10,000 applications in 2010 with over &euro;5m already paid out to date.  I anticipate that the enhanced allocation on energy programmes in 2010 will be extended.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to mitigating energy costs for vulnerable households through a combination of institutional supports, investment in improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock and the wide availability of advice.</P>
        <P>I am working closely with the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Environment, Heritage and Local Government to continue to deliver a fully cohesive Government response to the challenges of addressing energy affordability in Ireland in line with the commitment in the Renewed Programme for Government.  The Energy Affordability Strategy is being prepared under the auspices of the Interdepartmental/Agency Group and will be subject of public consultation shortly.  It will set out existing strategies and measures and future approaches to addressing energy affordability in a cohesive way.</P>
        <P>Enhancing the energy efficiency of homes through structural improvements is pivotal to the Government&rsquo;s strategy to address energy affordability.  To date, energy efficiency improvements in nearly 40,000 homes have been made under the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), of which 5,343 homes were completed in 2008 and 19,000 in 2009 (including nearly 3,000 homes delivered by the ESB according to WHS specification).  Some &euro;15 million was provided for the scheme in 2009, with a further &euro;5 million provided by ESB and BGE.  Of the &euro;15 million Exchequer allocation &euro;12.4m was spent under the scheme last year.  Funding of &euro;13m has been provided to the scheme in 2010.  The WHS will be further enhanced under the National Energy Retrofit Programme which was announced on Budget Day.</P>
        <P>The WHS provides energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, fuel poverty and is primarily delivered by community based organisations (CBOs) of which 22 have, to date, been approved to provide this service.  The CBOs work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations including public health nurses, MABS and St. Vincent De Paul to identify and address vulnerable homes.  Private contractors were also engaged in 2009 to address the increasing demand for the scheme.</P>

	<P>Under EU Directive 2001/77/EC, Ireland has a target of 13.2% for renewable electricity to be achieved by 2010.  Ireland is on track to exceed this target and will meet the higher Government Programme target of 15% of electricity from renewable sources by 2010.</P>
        <P>Between 2000 and 2007 renewable energy used for heat (RES-H) grew from 2.4 % to 3.7% before falling back slightly in 2008 to 3.6%. In absolute terms, biofuels in transport increased from 1 ktoe in 2005 (0.03% of road and rail transport [RES-T]) to 56 ktoe in 2008 (1.2%).</P><Col N="787"/>
        <P>Under the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC, Ireland&rsquo;s target is for 16% of all energy (to include electricity, heating and transport) to be from renewable sources by 2020.  The Government&rsquo;s targets of 40% of electricity, 12% of heating/cooling and 10% of transport to be sourced from renewable sources by 2020 are commensurate with Ireland&rsquo;s EU target.</P>
        <P>In December 2008, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) issued a decision, which requires EirGrid and ESB Networks to provide connection offers for an additional 3,900 MWs of new renewable capacity to ensure the 2020 target can be achieved.  This additional level of capacity, taken together with the capacity already built and the capacity that already has connection offers, is capable of meeting our 40% 2020 electricity target, which EirGrid and the CER equate to an overall capacity of 5,800 MW of renewable capacity.</P>
        <P>The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2009 sets out the actions under way and planned, which will deliver on the Government Programme targets of 20% energy savings across the economy and 33% in the public sector by 2020.</P>
        <P>The Ocean Energy Strategy is under way in support of delivering on the targets for ocean energy in the Government Programme.</P>

	<P>In 2008 the EU Commission issued a formal notice of infringement proceedings arising from the Commission&rsquo;s view that section 26 (4) of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act, 2007 was not compatible with Article 3(1) of Directive 2006/67/EC on the basis that the section allowed the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) stocks to be used as security against Agency loans.  While in reality, NORA never used nor planned to use its stocks as security against any of its loans, the undertaking was given to the Commission to repeal the relevant Section of the Act in the interest of ensuring full compliance with the terms of the Directive.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, I signed the European Communities (Repeal of Section 26(4) of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007) Regulations 2009 (S.I. No 247 of 2009) on 30th June 2009.  These Regulations repealed Section 26(4) of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007, in order to make the 2007 Act compatible with Article 3(1) of the Directive and the European Commission was notified of this action accordingly.</P>

	<P>The National Energy Retrofit Programme, announced on Budget Day is a major initiative which will reduce energy costs and carbon emissions in homes and business while also creating jobs and developing a sustainable market for energy services.  It will significantly reduce CO2 emissions and contribute to meeting the national efficiency targets including the target of 33% set for the public sector.  It will also create significant employment in the energy and construction sectors in support of economic renewal and building the Smart Economy.  </P>
        <P>The detailed design and specification of the new programme is being finalised by my Department and SEI.  The Programme will be the subject of public consultation shortly.  In broad terms the Retrofit Programme will bring together the Home Energy Savings Scheme (HES) and the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), as well as support programmes for business and the public sector.  It will also involve the development and promotion of energy services by the energy companies.</P>
        <P>Pending the introduction of the overall Retrofit Programme, the HES and the WHS are fully open for business with applications being received and processed by SEI.</P>
        <P>The HES Scheme which is administered by SEI, provides grant assistance to homeowners for energy efficiency retrofitting measures including attic and wall insulation, very high-efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.</P>
        <P>The scheme is open to anybody owning a house that was built prior to 2006.  Homeowners can expect to save up to &euro;700 per year on their energy bills if they install the full suite of measures available under the scheme.  The scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the typical cost of energy efficiency upgrade measures, depending on the measure concerned.</P>
        <P>The scheme, which was launched in March 2009, had attracted 40,724 applications by the end of 2009.  Some &euro;16.26 million was paid out by SEI by the end of the year, representing 33,434 energy efficient measures installed in 18,183 homes.  The scheme allows homeowners six months, from the date of grant approval, to have the work undertaken.  Applications, take up and expenditure trends in January and to date in February have been most encouraging with over 1,000 applications per week on average.</P>

	<P>Grid25 is EirGrid&rsquo;s strategy for developing Ireland&rsquo;s electricity transmission network over the next fifteen years.  The plan envisages the doubling of Ireland&rsquo;s grid capacity over the period to 2025, and will involve investment of &euro;4 billion in this critical national infrastructure.  I fully support EirGrid&rsquo;s plans for the transmission network as a strategic imperative.</P>
        <P>The strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s transmission grid is essential to allow increased integration of renewable energy in the Irish electricity system, facilitating the growth of secure indigenous energy resources and ensuring for the first time the capacity to export electricity generated in Ireland from renewable resources.  It will also ensure secure, competitive and sustainable electricity supplies for industry and consumers by providing the capacity to meet future demand.  Grid25 is therefore a key driver of economic growth and recovery.  It is central to the achievement of a de-carbonised energy system for Ireland.</P>
        <P>As the state owned National Transmission System Operator, EirGrid is proactively progressing Ireland&rsquo;s transmission development needs in line with Grid25, as a matter of priority.  Work on a number of 110kV projects and three 220kV projects which have already received planning permission is underway.  A further set of projects is currently the subject of public consultation in advance of planning consents being sought.  These include key 110kV to 400kV developments at Moneypoint, Aghada, Shannonbridge, Mullingar and Loughteeogue.  An application for planning consent was submitted in respect of the Meath Cavan Interconnection Project in December 2009, and construction on the East West Interconnector is scheduled to commence shortly.</P>
        <P>In parallel with the roll-out of these projects, EirGrid has undertaken a series of regional briefings with stakeholders, on the longer-term implementation programme for Grid25.  Detailed studies are being prepared to specify reinforcement requirements, and will assess environmental impact, technical issues, and route identification for the necessary regional schemes.  These will form the basis for consultation with the public and all key stakeholders in the development of this strategic national infrastructure.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 139 of 23 February 2010, the reason the Central Statistics Office has not been represented by any other State body at EU or UN meetings in relation to the collection of statistics in view of the fact that in the National Disability Authority&rsquo;s Operational Research Plan 2007 to 2009 it is stated on page 11 that it has participated on behalf of the CSO in the meetings of the UN Washington City Group on Disability Statistics. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 112 together.</P>
        <P>The Washington Group on Disability Statistics was formed as a result of the United Nations International Seminar on Measurement of Disability that took place in New York in June 2001.  An outcome of that meeting was the recognition that statistical and methodological work was needed at an international level in order to facilitate the comparison of data on disability cross-nationally.  The City Group is an informal, temporary organisational format, reporting to the United Nations Statistical Commission, that allows representatives from national statistical agencies from a number of countries to come together along with subject matter and other experts to address selected problems in statistical methods.  The composition of the Washington Group is representatives of National Statistics Institutes, International Organisations with an interest in disability statistics and national organisations with a research, policy or representational role.</P>
        <P>The Washington Group first met in 2002 and has held nine meetings in total. Representatives from Ireland have attended the last seven meetings of the Group.  The Irish delegation has included officials/experts from the Central Statistics Office, the National Disability Authority and Trinity College Dublin as appropriate.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Group has reflected considerable national developments in recent years, notably: the disability questions in the Census of Population and the 2006 National Disability Survey.  The Central Statistics Office was a member of the Washington Group Steering Committee in 2008 and 2009.</P>
        <P>The 2007 meeting in Dublin was organised and hosted by the CSO in conjunction with the NDA. Some officials from the Health Research Board and other Irish organisations with an interest in disability attended this meeting as observers.</P>
        <P>As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 139 of 23 February 2010, the CSO has not been represented by any other State body in relation to the work of the Group.  Instead the composition of the Irish representation reflects the need for both producers and expert users of disability statistics to be engaged in methodological work of this nature.  By way of analogy at national level, the CSO has worked closely with the NDA in the development and conduct of the National Disability Survey, in the formulation and review of the Census disability questions, in discussions of issues arising from the work of the Washington Group, on ethical issues concerning the conduct of the National Disability Survey, and more generally in relation to issues of relevance to disability statistics.</P>

	<P>The business referred to by the Deputy could avail of assistance through the Work Placement Programme.  The programme is designed to provide unemployed people, including unemployed graduates, with the opportunity to obtain nine months work experience.  The placement is unpaid but eligible participants retain their social welfare payments during their placement.  Participants gain valuable work experience allowing them to keep their skills fresh and relevant to the job market.  The business must meet with a number of eligibility criteria, including having no vacancies in the areas of activity in which the placement is offered.  Furthermore, the placement cannot be provided to displace an existing employee and the business must not have made any person redundant in the last 3 months.</P>
        <P>Another possible option would be the Wage Subsidy Scheme, which is available to employers, outside of the Public Sector.  This scheme provides financial incentives to encourage the employment of persons with disabilities.</P><Col N="794"/>

        <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the eight month delay in her Department&rsquo;s response in paying rebates due on foot of redundancy payments by the private sector; when a claim submitted on 2 July 2009 will be awarded to a company (details supplied) in Dublin 18; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  </P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Redundancy Payments Section of my Department processed an application for a statutory rebate claim submitted by the company concerned and that payment is expected to issue within the next week.</P>
        <P>Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for 2009 of 77,001.  This figure exceeds the claims <Col N="796"/>lodged for 2008 (40,607) by 90% and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 52.5;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is clear that these interventions are having an impact in that for example the numbers of claims processed and paid by the Redundancy Payments Section in 2008 and 2009 respectively amounted to 29,802 and 50,664.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and I are monitoring closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims.  However, it is clear that additional measures are required to help reduce the backlog of claims, which currently stands in excess of 40,000.  The Department is currently actively engaged in efforts to secure up to 16 additional staff resources deployed to the area in the first quarter of 2010.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>Primary responsibility for this sector rests with the Minister of Transport.  I can advise the Deputy however that the terms and conditions of employment on board international cruise ships are linked to the State in which the ship is registered.  In the case of workers employed on Irish registered vessels, the terms and conditions of those employees on the vessel are subject to the provisions of Irish law whether the ship is in Irish territorial waters or on the high seas.  This would include legislation dealing with minimum wages.  The conditions of employment, including minimum wages, of workers on board vessels under the Irish flag are governed by a comprehensive corpus of Irish employment rights legislation. </P>
        <P>If the vessel is not registered in Ireland, it will also be subject to port state control inspections in Ireland by the Department of Transport.  Such inspections cover safety, environment protection and International Labour Organisation Conventions.  The latter covers the welfare of the crew (food, accommodation, hours of work etc) but excludes rates of pay.</P>
        <P>Ireland has consistently supported the International Labour Organisation in its efforts to promote global labour standards for seafarers.  A new consolidated Maritime Labour Convention was adopted in February 2006 at the 94th International Labour Conference in Geneva.  Ireland was represented at the Conference by a tripartite delegation consisting of Government officials, nominees of the employers (IBEC) and of the workers (ICTU).  The new Convention sets out clear principles and rights for seafarers.  EU member states are committed to ratifying the new Convention by 31 December 2010 and it is expected to come into force internationally in 2011.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 130 together.</P>
        <P>In March 2008 the Government set a 25% target to reduce administrative burdens on business arising from regulations by 2012. My Department is charged with leading the cross-Government drive to reduce administrative burdens.  This is being done in a prioritised way, drawing from the experience of other Member States involved in administrative burden reduction.</P>
        <P>During 2009, a prioritized list of more than thirty Information Obligations in Company Law, Employment Law and Health &amp; Safety Law, which falls within the remit of my Department, were measured. The results of this exercise were validated by business in December 2009.</P>
        <P>My Department is now setting up a series of simplification workshops, to be run during the first half of this year, to identify ways to reduce burdens in the three measured areas.  The workshops will canvass business for their views on how best to reduce the measured burdens.</P>
        <P>At Inter-Departmental level Departments that have regulations that affects business are identifying the information obligations contained in their legislation that are likely to be causing the biggest burdens for business.  A consolidated priority list of information obligations will be agreed and then measured in a single cross-Government project. Simplification plans will then be developed to reduce the administrative burden. I expect that this project will be completed in 2011.</P>
        <P>It will not be possible to provide a final figure for the overall baseline until all of the burdens have been measured and the simplification plans have been completed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>EU relations with Colombia are conducted in the framework of regional relations between the EU and the Andean Community, comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and <Col N="799"/>Peru.  In 2007, negotiations aimed at concluding a comprehensive Association Agreement between the EU and the Andean Community were formally launched.  Such Agreements cover all facets of relations between the EU and these countries, including political dialogue, economic cooperation and trade.  However, as not all member states of the Andean Community were in a position to proceed with free trade negotiations, the decision was taken to commence negotiations on a multiparty Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and two member states of the Andean Community &mdash; Colombia and Peru &mdash; within the overall framework of the Association Agreement.  </P>
        <P>The European Union has competence in trade negotiations. So these were carried out by the European Commission on the basis of a mandate from the Council. The Commission announced on 1 March that trade talks with Peru and Colombia have concluded, reaching an agreement on the key elements of a trade arrangement. This will inaugurate a new framework of bilateral trade and investment relations between the European Union and the signatory Andean countries.</P>
        <P>Colombia, however, faces many challenges.  It has experienced the longest period of terrorist violence of any country in Latin America. There is no single solution for promoting peace in Colombia; the various social and economic elements underlying the conflict have to be tackled simultaneously.  Our approach and that of the European Union is to assist and influence the Colombian Government in a manner that results in economic and social development while progressively improving human rights standards.  The conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Colombia will contribute significantly to the social and economic development of Colombia, which is imperative if it is to emerge from its violent past.</P>
        <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that there is no question of strengthening economic ties with Colombia at the expense of human rights.  I am of the view that the FTA process with Colombia at this time offers the best opportunity to ensure that the concerns of EU Member States at the human rights situation in that country and, in particular, the treatment of trade union activists are fully addressed by the Colombian government<b><i>.</i></b></P>
        <P>I and my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs have taken a number of steps in addressing human rights issues directly with the Government of Colombia and together with the European Union. My officials have raised our concerns in various meetings of the Trade Policy Committee to highlight our deep interest in addressing the human rights situation in Colombia as part of the negotiations with Colombia. Ireland has insisted on the inclusion of a clause committing both the EU Member States and Colombia to the implementation of their human rights responsibilities with the proviso that failure to do would result in the suspension of the Agreement.</P>
        <P>I can assure you that the Government will continue to closely follow the human rights situation in Colombia and take the steps we consider necessary bilaterally as well as in cooperation with our EU partners.</P>

All notified mergers are considered by the Authority with reference to whether the result of the merger will be to substantially lessen competition in markets for goods or services in the State.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of redundancy payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 24 September, 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.</P>
        <P>In this case, as in all cases where the employer claims inability to pay the employee(s) statutory redundancy, the Department requires the employer to provide sufficient proof to substantiate the claim. This includes providing the latest set of audited accounts for the company as well as certification from the company&rsquo;s Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the fact that the employer has insufficient assets to pay the redundancy entitlements.  Providing this documentation is submitted and is in order, the Department pays the employee(s) directly from the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
        <P>In this case, adequate supporting documentation from the employer was requested by my Department in November 2009 and was received on 26 February 2010.  I understand that following receipt of the required information the claim is being processed and payment is expected to issue within the next two to three weeks.</P>

	<P>To the end of December 2009, 186 people had started a placement as part of the Work Placement Programme; 129 took up graduate placements and 57 took up non-graduate placements.</P>
        <P>To date, 473 people have started placements, 308 of which are graduates and 165 are non-graduates.  There are 2,000 places available under the Work Placement Programme, with 1,000 places for the graduate stream and 1,000 places for the non-graduate stream.</P>
        <P>There are no additional direct costs in administering the Work Placement Programme.  The programme is being delivered using F&Aacute;S existing resources and budgets.  The only cost per participant on the Work Placement Programme is for participants who are in receipt of a social welfare payment. Participants will continue to receive this payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs for the duration they are entitled to.  F&Aacute;S does not make any payments to participants while they are on a placement.</P>

	<P>The 2010 financial allocation to Galway County and City Enterprise Board, and to each of the other 34 individual Enterprise Boards, is derived from the final allocation set out for my Department in the Revised Estimate as published on 18 February 2010.  The 2010 budget allocation for the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) is over &euro;28m of which &euro;14.9m has been allocated for Capital expenditure.  In 2009, a further &euro;6m capital allocation was made available for the CEBs under the Department&rsquo;s capital carryover process.  This absence of any capital carryover provision in 2010 accounts for the differences in allocations to individual boards as between 2009 and 2010.</P>
        <P>The CEB Central Coordination Unit, based within Enterprise Ireland, has recently advised the individual Enterprise Boards of their 2010 budget allocations. All CEBs have, in the case of their Capital allocation, received 65% of their 2009 capital allocations with some resources remaining to be allocated at a later stage.  This represents prudent management of the available funding in the context of the ongoing pressures on public finances. All Boards will have to manage the resources very carefully to match the needs of the micro-enterprise sector in their areas.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the situation will be closely monitored by both the CEB Central Coordination Unit and by my Department over the coming months in conjunction with the individual CEBs themselves.</P>

Some &euro;1.4 billion of private investment as well as &euro;1.65 billion in public investment was originally envisaged as required to deliver on the Master plan objectives.</P>
        <P>To-date the Government despite constraints on capital funding has provided in excess of &euro;50m in the 2.5 years since the initiative commenced in mid-2007.  This funding has contributed to increased stabilisation of the four areas, through rehousing, a planned programme of demolitions, environmental improvement works, CCTV infrastructure, social and community supports etc.</P>
        <P>A further &euro;25m was provisionally allocated by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government in support of the Programme in 2010 and the programme of works to be carried out is currently under discussion between the Agencies, Limerick City Council, <Col N="807"/>Limerick County Council and Clare County Council.  Additional investment has been provided in terms of Garda resources, as well as other State interventions through Education, Youth, Health, Training and Community facilities and services targeted at the areas.</P>
        <P>Work has been progressing in 2009 on the detailed planning and design of two sheltered housing projects serving Myross and Ballinacurra Weston and a Project Team is working to advance the projects to tender stage in 2010. Two further projects serving the Southhill and St Mary&rsquo;s Park areas are currently being developed within the Project Team. While much attention to date has been focused on demolition and other essential works associated with the preparing of the areas for physical regeneration, the relevant agencies acknowledge the importance of progressing &ldquo;new-build&rdquo; projects at an early stage and the Government is committed to facilitating this within the overall resources available for 2010.</P>
        <P>Tax Incentive Measures have provided a vital stimulus to the economy in Ireland, but we also recognise that there is a heavy cost on the Exchequer.  This year and for the years 2011 and 2012 the Government needs to achieve savings in the region of &euro;3 billion in each year.  There are many conflicting demands on the Government at this time.  New innovative thinking is required in tacking projects such as the Limerick Regeneration Masterplan.  However, the inclusion of tax incentives within such plans require very careful examination, given the current difficult Exchequer position. </P>

        <P>The recently published Finance Bill contains provisions which, when enacted, will allow for the supply of information held by the Commission for Taxi Regulation to the Revenue Commissioners.  I am informed that, following the passing of the Bill, it is the intention to request details of all Small Public Service Vehicle Drivers (SPSV) licence holders from the Commission for Taxi Regulation. This data will then be checked against the Revenue database to ensure that all licence holders actively engaged in working in the taxi business are registered with Revenue. Instances where taxi drivers are not registered will be pursued by Revenue to ensure registration and payment of taxes due. Meetings are planned with a view to progressing the supply of the information.</P><Col N="808"/>
        <P>Quite apart from the supply of information, officials from the Revenue Commissioners and the Commission for Taxi Regulation regularly, and on an ongoing basis, participate in Multi-Agency Checkpoints and operations. These checkpoints and operations are carried out with assistance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and regularly also involve officials from the Dept of Social and Family Affairs. These checkpoints and operations involve interviewing taxi drivers at ranks and at checkpoints with a view to ascertaining the compliance of the drivers interviewed with both taxi regulations and tax obligations. Checks are also made to see if the taxi drivers are in receipt of social welfare benefits and appropriate action is taken by all agencies where non-compliance or abuses are discovered.</P>
        <P>As a result of these operations, fines have been issued by the Commission for Taxi Regulation; individuals who were not registered for tax or were registered incorrectly have now been registered by Revenue and instances of individuals working and claiming benefits are being investigated by Dept. of Social and Family Affairs.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this case involves the seizure of a non-State registered motor vehicle owned by a State resident. The vehicle in question was a new means of transport when it was acquired in the UK in June 2008. A new means of transport is defined as a motorised land vehicle which is intended for the transport of persons or goods, which was supplied six months or less after the date of first entry into service, or which has travelled 6000 kilometres or less.</P>
        <P>The vehicle&rsquo;s supply and acquisition in June 2008 is defined under Value Added Tax legislation as an intra-Community acquisition of goods on which VAT was chargeable at the date of supply. The date of the transport of the vehicle to Ireland did not affect the charge to VAT <Col N="810"/>in the case in question. However, this tax only became payable at the time the relevant Vehicle Registration Tax liability arose, the non- payment of which resulted in the vehicle&rsquo;s seizure.</P>
        <P>The compromise penalties offered for the release of the vehicle in this case are in line with normal administrative practice and are calculated by reference to the amount of VRT and VAT evaded and the length of the time the vehicle has been in the State. Payment of the compromise penalty is in lieu of forfeiture of the vehicle and legal proceedings. The Revenue Commissioners have already reviewed this case in the light of earlier representations and I am advised that they consider the release terms to be proportionate and a further review to be unwarranted.</P>
        <P>Under Section 143 of the Finance Act 2001, a person can give notice in writing contesting the liability to forfeiture of anything that has been seized. Revenue considers that correspondence already received in this case constitutes such a notice. In such cases Revenue is legally obliged to initiate civil legal proceedings for the forfeiture and condemnation of the goods in question. In the absence of a settlement being otherwise arrived at, Revenue will initiate these proceedings, in which the court will adjudicate on the validity of the seizure action. The parties contesting the seizure and their legal representatives, if any, will be required to attend and give evidence at any such proceedings.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the issue of VAT and cemeteries. The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that under the Irish VAT Act the purchase of a burial plot in a cemetery or through an undertaker is taxable at the lower VAT rate of 13.5%. Consequently the supply of burial plots by private cemeteries is currently subject to VAT. </P>
        <P>While cemeteries operated by local authorities are currently outside of the scope of VAT, provision is being made in the Finance Bill 2010 to apply VAT to certain local authority services from 1 July 2010. Local authority cemeteries will then become subject to VAT. However, since the local authorities will have an entitlement to recover from Revenue the VAT incurred on their input costs in providing the service, the degree to which the VAT is passed on should be less than the full VAT rate of 13.5%. I will be urging local authorities to take this into account. It is of course a matter for a local authority to determine the overall charge in respect of the services it supplies.</P>
        <P>This change is required in response to a ruling by the European Court of Justice on 16 July 2009 under Case C-554/07 which found that Ireland had failed to correctly transpose the EU <Col N="811"/>VAT Directive regarding the application of VAT to services supplied by public bodies including local authorities. In order to comply with the ECJ ruling, it is necessary to make services provided by public bodies including local authorities subject to VAT unless they are otherwise exempted from VAT in accordance with the EU VAT Directive.</P>

        <P>However, in recognition of the problems faced by people in many areas of the country due to the recent flooding, the Government allocated an initial sum of &euro;10m to fund a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme.

Prioritisation of resource allocation in my Department, including the management of vacancies, is carried out on an ongoing basis with reference to the Department&rsquo;s business needs at any given time, the level of expenditure available from which to meet those commitments and the recommendations of the Report of the Special Group on Public Sector Numbers and Expenditure.  In that regard, my Department is constantly managing its resources and vacancies, which will include the necessity to re-allocate, or reconfigure work areas and posts.

	<P>Section 22 of the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009 provides that I shall appoint an Assessor at an appropriate time having regard to the public interest, to determine the fair and reasonable aggregate value of the transferred shares and extinguished rights and the consequent amount of compensation, if any, that may be payable to persons in respect of Anglo shares transferred and rights extinguished under the Act. Work on the process to appoint an Assessor under EU procurement rules is underway in my Department and will be completed soon.</P>
        <P>With regard to treatment of Anglo shares in making tax returns, the Revenue Commissioners have published guidance on their website (e-Brief 76/09, dated 3 November 2009) explaining that the transfer of Anglo Irish Bank shares to the Minister for Finance may be considered a disposal to which the capital gains tax &ldquo;negligible value&rdquo; rule applies. The result is that, where a claim is made, the shares will be treated as being of negligible value and a loss for the 2009 tax year may be calculated, which is available for set-off in the same way as any other capital loss.</P>
        <P>Compensation, if any, arising by virtue of a decision by the Assessor on the residual value of the shares, will be treated for capital gains tax purposes as consideration for disposal at the time of receipt. If a negligible value loss has been claimed, there will be no acquisition cost to set against such compensation. If a negligible value loss has not been claimed, the base cost will be the acquisition cost (and expenses of acquisition) of the shares transferred to the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>The OPW and Galway County Council set up a Joint Working Group following the recent widespread flooding in the County in order to assist the identification of measures to address localised flood problems that could be taken forward quickly. The Group identified a number of locations that they would focus on initially, including a number of locations in South Galway.  Where viable, cost effective mitigation works are identified they will generally be carried out by the Council with funding from OPW but, where appropriate, OPW may itself undertake works as agent of the Council.</P>
        <P>Galway County Council has recently submitted applications for funding for minor flood mitigation works that the Council proposes to undertake at a number of locations in 2010. These applications are currently being considered, in conjunction with applications received from other Local Authorities, having regard to specific economic and environmental eligibility criteria and the overall funding available for flood mitigation works this year. It is expected that a decision will be made shortly in relation to applications for funding received to date. The OPW understands that the Council will submit further applications in the near future.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to say at this stage when works may commence at any particular location.</P>

	<P>I am giving consideration to the legal position with regard to the provision of aftercare services, having regard to the existing legislative provisions as set out in the Child Care Act 1991.  I had a positive meeting recently with Focus Ireland in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, 2009 Implementation Plan states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The provision of aftercare by the HSE should form an integral part of care delivery for children who have been in the care of the state.  It should not be seen as a discretionary service or as a once-off event that occurs on a young person&rsquo;s 18th birthday.</P>
        <P>The report makes the following recommendations in relation to aftercare:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />The HSE will ensure the provision of aftercare services for children leaving care in all instances where the professional judgment of the allocated social worker determines it is required;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />The HSE will, with their consent, conduct a longitudinal study to follow young people who leave care for 10 years, to map their transition to adulthood;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />The HSE and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will review the approach to prioritising identified at-risk young people leaving care and requiring local authority housing;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />The HSE will ensure care plans include aftercare planning for all young people of 16 years and older;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />The HSE will ensure that aftercare planning identifies key workers in other health services to which a young person is referred, for example, disability and mental health services;</P><Col N="820"/>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />The OMCYA, in conjunction with the HSE, will consider how best to provide necessary once-off supports for care leavers to gain practical lifelong skills.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In line with the Government commitment as reflected in the Ryan Implementation Plan funding of &euro;1.0m was set aside by the HSE in its 2010 Service Plan, for the development of aftercare services in 2010.</P>

        <P>The importation of cannabis and substances and products containing cannabis to Ireland, even if legally obtained in another EU Member State, is prohibited.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 to 188, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Information and Tracing Unit in the Adoption Board provides an advice and referral service for those seeking to trace or to obtain medical or personal information. This unit provides services directly to adoptees, natural mothers and birth families.  It also works closely with the registered adoption societies and the HSE national information and tracing services.  Improvements to this service have been effected by the computerisation of the unique adoption files held by the Board. In addition, the National Adoption Contact Preference Register (NACPR) is designed to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information, or to state their contact preferences.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Board, together with adoption societies, the HSE and support groups, developed the &ldquo;Standardised Framework for the Provision of a National Information and Tracing Service&rdquo;.  This Framework, published in November 2007, sets standards and provides guidance and advice for information and tracing service providers nationally. There is no statutory basis for the framework which is being implemented on a consensus basis.</P>
        <P>My Office is advised by the Adoption Board that the Framework is currently being reviewed and has been temporarily removed from the Board&rsquo;s website.  However, the documentation set out in the Framework has been widely disseminated to societies, support groups and other <Col N="822"/>interested parties and will continue to be made available to anyone contacting the Board to seek a copy. The Framework will again be made available through the Adoption Board website once the review is complete.</P>
        <P>In overall terms it is considered that there is an effective administrative system in place to deal with the issue of information and tracing. Consequently, the current Adoption Bill, 2009 does not make specific provisions in this regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189, 190 and 192 together.</P>
        <P>A patient who was in receipt of public in-patient services and subject to long-stay charges under section 53 of the Health Act 1970 prior to the introduction of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, can choose to continue with their current arrangements when transferring to a public nursing home.  In other words, where the person remains in receipt of public care services, they can choose to continue paying long-stay charges in accordance with section 53 of the Health Act 1970 and do not have to transfer to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the patient will not have to undergo the assessments, including the care needs assessment, provided for in the new scheme.  However, the Deputy will be aware that in 2009 my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, introduced new Care and Welfare Regulations to underpin the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.  Article 8 of the Regulations states that &ldquo;the person in charge shall ensure each resident&rsquo;s needs are set out in an individual care plan developed and agreed with each resident.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The National Standards themselves consist of 32 standards, focusing on the outcomes for the resident, under the following seven groupings: Rights, Protection, Health and Social Needs, Quality of Life, Staffing, The Care Environment and Governance and Management. The standards are a key requirement for the registration and inspection of nursing homes and they are underpinned by the<b> </b>Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009.</P>
        <P>Amongst other things, the standards govern the procedure for moving to long-term residential care. In particular, Standard 10 addresses the assessment requirements by providing that  &ldquo;Each resident has his/her needs assessed prior to moving into the residential care setting, a <Col N="823"/>full assessment upon admission, and subsequently as required to reflect changes in need and circumstances during his/her period in residence.</P>
        <P>Standard 11 provides that &ldquo;The arrangements to meet each resident&rsquo;s assessed needs are set out in an individual care plan, developed and agreed with each resident, or in the case of a resident with cognitive impairment with his/her representative.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>At the request of the Department of Health and Children, a review of the Department was carried out last year under the Organisational Review Programme (ORP). The report was received about four weeks ago &mdash; not last September. It will be published, along with similar reports on other Government Offices, following submission to the Government in due course. The report did not identify major deficiencies and waste in the Department. Its principal conclusions include the following:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />The Department of Health and Children is an organisation in transition as a result of the formation of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in 2005, as this event led to substantial changes to the Department&rsquo;s roles and responsibilities.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />The health sector is a particularly challenging sector of the public service and the Department regularly has to deal with crises which place it in the media and political <Col N="824"/>spotlight.  Looking into the future it is likely that significant resource constraints will add to the challenges faced by the Department.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />There is general recognition amongst the Department&rsquo;s agencies and stakeholders that its greatest strengths are the ability and commitment of its staff in dealing with a difficult agenda.  The staff have a deep knowledge of the health sector and they are widely praised for the quality of the policies they bring forward.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">However, the Department&rsquo;s staff, agencies and stakeholders also recognise that in order to respond to the challenges and address issues of capacity the Department, as a priority, needs to:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Fully clarify its roles and responsibilities vis-&agrave;-vis the HSE, in particular.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Become better at managing the delivery of all its agencies (including the HSE); to do this it needs to become stronger at goal setting, measuring outputs and outcomes, and managing performance so as to ensure the implementation of its policies.</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Define its customer and stakeholder groups clearly and align resources, processes and procedures to serve each one in the most appropriate way and, at the same time, strike an optimal balance in the allocation of resources between competing priorities, including serving the needs of the Ministers and the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Improve its human resources capacities in general, and in particular improve its outcomes in terms of morale and analytical capability as well as tackling issues with</P>

	<P>The Financial Assessment for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme takes all the individual&rsquo;s income and assets into account, including property and wealth outside of the State.  The person&rsquo;s contribution to care is then worked out based on 80% of the person&rsquo;s assessable income and 5% of the value of their assets per annum.  However, the first &euro;36,000 of the person&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not included at all in the assessment.  It should also be noted that a person may never pay more than the cost of their care.  Finally, the Deputy should note that the Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme is only available in respect of land-based assets within the State.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the enforcement of food safety and food labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and its official agents, which include the Health Service Executive, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (DAFF), Local Authorities (LAs) and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA).</P>
        <P>Due to the public service industrial action involving members of IMPACT within the Health Service Executive (HSE), the HSE is not in a position to provide data to this response and consequently some of the data (particularly in respect of the second half of 2009) is not available.</P><Col N="834"/>
        <P el="10"><i>Prosecutions</i></P>
        <P el="0">Further to the reply forwarded to the Deputy in May 2009 by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, a successful prosecution was taken by the FSAI against a food business in Galway: the legislation cited for breaches included the Labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products Regulations 2003.  An unsuccessful prosecution was taken by the FSAI in March 2009 against two companies, including a number of Directors, in relation to the supply/placing on the market of certain fishery products. The case was dismissed.  From January 2009 to date, the HSE initiated 17 successful prosecutions under food legislation. One of these prosecutions cited the 2006 Country of Origin of Beef Regulations and one cited the Beef Labelling Regulations 2000 as amended.  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority concluded one conviction in 2009 for breaches of food legislation.</P>
         <P el="10"><i>Inspections</i></P>
        <P el="0">The HSE recorded 5,705 inspections in the retail sector and 15,181 in the service sector including restaurants in the first half of 2009.  From January to June 2009, compliance with beef country of origin regulations was assessed in 4,092 inspections and 1,108 non-compliances were recorded. For the same period, compliance with labelling of beef and beef products regulations was assessed in 3,584 inspections and 727 non compliances were recorded. Many of these non compliances would be for minor infringements and Environmental Health Officers follow up on all of these non compliances with the Food Business Operators  to ensure compliance.</P>
       <P el="10"><i>Labelling inspections</i></P>
        <P el="0">Labelling inspections are carried out as part of the food safety inspections of food businesses. During the course of these inspections a total of 8,715 hygiene and labelling infringements including general hygiene and labelling were identified by Environmental Health Officers in the first half of 2009. The HSE issued 326 enforcement notices and orders under the FSAI Act in 2009.</P>
        <P>Local Authority Veterinary Inspectors carry out inspections in 456 establishments. There are some outstanding returns due to be forwarded to the FSAI but so far Local Authorities have reported 12 major non compliances for 2009.  In 2009, 3,200 inspections were carried out by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority. Ten compliance notices, one prohibition order, one closure order and one improvement notice were issued.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have reported inspection data for the first three quarters of 2009. The meat and meat products division carried out 7,810 inspections for this period. The milk products division carried out 350 hygiene inspection and the egg and poultry inspectors carried out 2,441 inspections in the same period.</P>

	<P>The Strategic Rail Review (SRR) set out priorities for future rail investment which provided an input into the development of Transport 21, my Department&rsquo;s investment framework. The SRR did not include the development of rail services in Cavan, Monaghan or Donegal in its recommendations. As a consequence, no capital provision for such rail development was included in Transport 21 and it is not a priority for investment in the current difficult economic situation.  As I have previously indicated, the Programme for Government contained a commitment to commence preparation of a successor to Transport 21.  It is in the context of such a successor Programme that consideration will be given to future transport investments.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome any proposals regarding the advancement of public transport and am pleased to acknowledge the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly&rsquo;s interest in the possible development of public transport services in Fermanagh, Tyrone, Cavan, Monaghan, and Donegal. As the Deputy will be aware issues relating to cross-border public transport services are also discussed on a regular basis under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council. While there is no provision for funding for a study at present both Governments are committed to the development of cross-border public transport services and the matter will be kept under review.</P>

Specifically, Section 57 of the Roads Act 1993, as amended by Section 271 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, provides that the NRA may prepare a scheme for the establishment of a system of tolls in respect of the use of a public road.

	<P>The current rules governing use of bus lanes were established through the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997-1998.  Large public service vehicles (buses) are permitted to use all bus lanes.  The key consideration underpinning the current policy is that bus lanes are provided to support and promote bus-based public transport and to protect the carrying capacity of bus lanes so as to optimise journey times for the members of the public who use that mode of transport.</P>
        <P>Two exemptions are provided in the regulations.  Pedal cyclists are regarded as being vulnerable road users and, on road safety grounds, are permitted to use with-flow bus lanes.</P>
        <P>Taxis are available for hire on-street to the public at large and are regarded as being an element of the public transport service and are, accordingly, permitted to use with-flow bus lanes.  I have no proposals to extend further the types of vehicles permitted to use bus lanes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 256 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware that in some cases demands for payment of ground rents may not have been made for a number of years.  Where, in such cases, a demand for payment is subsequently made by the ground rent landlord, the landlord is statute barred from claiming more than 6 years arrears of ground rent.  Moreover, section 27 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents)(No. 2) Act 1978 provides that a landlord cannot re-enter or take possession of premises in respect of which payment of the ground rent is in arrears.</P>
        <P>A legal challenge to the constitutionality of the purchase price provisions of ground rents legislation was heard in the High Court in 2005.  While the Court&rsquo;s judgment upholding the constitutionality of the legislation was delivered in early 2006, it has since been appealed to the Supreme Court.  While operation of the law in relation to ground rents continues to be reviewed in my Department, there are no proposals for changes pending the outcome of this appeal.</P>

        <P>Under current regulations on admission and appointment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, recruitment to the Garda rank is open to all citizens of the EEA, although there is no provision for serving members in police forces in other States to apply directly for posts at higher ranks.</P>
        <P>Under an Intergovernmental Agreement on Police Co-operation between Ireland and the UK, however, provision is made for members from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI to apply for posts in the other Force at ranks above Inspector.  Giving effect to this will require changes to the current Garda regulations, and my Department is in ongoing discussions on this with the Garda Commissioner, the Garda representative associations and the Northern Ireland Office.  Under this Agreement, personnel exchanges between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI are already in place, and a Garda Superintendent will shortly be seconded to the PSNI.</P>

Two types of grant have been made available.  Substantive grants of up to &euro;100,000 have been made available from my Department with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs providing matching funding for successful applications from RAPID areas.  Pre-development grants of up to &euro;5,000 have also been made available to assist local communities to develop substantive proposals in their areas.</P>
        <P>Two major rounds of the scheme were advertised in 2005/2006 and 2007 with a total of 13 and 30 substantive schemes respectively approved for funding. A further 2 schemes under the Limerick Regeneration programme were approved in 2008.  In addition, 54 schemes were awarded pre-development grants over the same period.  To date, a total of 26 substantive schemes have been installed. Installation of the remaining 19 Community CCTV Schemes is ongoing with Schemes at various stages of implementation.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 26 May 2006.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), he was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 15 January 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and following the consideration of this application, a decision was made to refuse the application and this decision was conveyed in writing to the person concerned by letter dated 15 February 2010.  The case of the person concerned was then considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement following which a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned.  This Order was formally served on the person concerned by registered post dated 22 February 2010.  This communication advised the person concerned that a Deportation Order had been made against him which placed a legal obligation on him to leave the State by 12 March 2010 or, if he fails to do so, he must present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 16 March 2010 to make arrangements for his deportation from the State.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query about the impact of a Court decision on the refusal of the application for Subsidiary Protection made by the person concerned, it is not clear as to what Court decision the Deputy is referring to or what its relevance to the case of the person concerned might be.</P>

	<P>My Department and bodies under its aegis employ some 25,000 staff, including civil servants, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Prison Officers and the Judiciary.  In March 2009, the Government introduced a moratorium on the filling of vacancies in the public service, either by way of recruitment or promotion.  Subsequently, the Government introduced an Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER) and an Incentivised Career Break Scheme (ICBS).  Taken together, these Schemes are exerting downward pressure on numbers in the public service, including in my Department and its Agencies.</P>
        <P>Given the size and complexity of the Justice and Equality Sector, my Department&rsquo;s focus is on ensuring that key posts that are essential to the functioning of the Sector are filled.  To that end, I have already secured exemptions in respect of a number of key positions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Prison Service.  The Deputy can be assured that where vacancies arise that are critical to the functioning of the Justice and Equality Sector, I will continue to seek exemptions to the moratorium.</P>

	<P>Ireland claims continental shelf extending beyond the standard 200 nautical mile entitlement both to the west and to the south of the country. Under international law these claims must be examined by the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. For the purposes of our claims we have divided the extended shelf into three sectors.</P>
        <P>The first sector is to the south-west of the country near the Porcupine Abyssal Plain, an area which is approximately half the size of the State&rsquo;s land territory. It was the subject of Ireland&rsquo;s first submission to the Commission. The Commission issued recommendations in 2007. These confirmed Ireland&rsquo;s entitlement in this sector and set out details of where the new outer limit there should be established. The area involved is approx. 39,000 square kilometres, which is a very satisfactory outcome. The Government made an Order last year under the 1968 Continen<Col N="852"/>tal Shelf Act which formally establishes the area concerned as Irish continental shelf. The details of this new area of Irish continental shelf have been deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.</P>
        <P>The second claim is in the Celtic Sea, where there are unresolved boundary issues with the UK, France and Spain. The four countries made a joint submission for this 80,000 square kilometre area in 2006. Last March the UN Commission confirmed this claim and negotiations on the division of the area concerned between the four countries are expected to begin later this year.</P>
        <P>Ireland also claims part of the Hatton-Rockall Area of the North-East Atlantic, which extends up to 500 nautical miles from the coast. There is an agreed Ireland-UK boundary here but it is not accepted by Iceland or the F&aelig;roe Islands, which make their own claims. The four countries have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the overlapping claims issue, but to date have been unable to reach agreement. In view of the 10-year deadline for the making of submissions to the UN Commission &mdash; which for Ireland expired last May &mdash; the State lodged its national claim for this area at the end of March. While the Commission&rsquo;s rules of procedure prevent consideration of a submission concerning a disputed area without the consent of all the states concerned, its lodgement at this time stops the clock on the deadline and preserves Ireland&rsquo;s legal position. In the meantime, the four states intend to keep the matter under regular review and we will continue to work for the creation of conditions that will permit consideration of the submission by the Commission as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>EU relations with Colombia are conducted in the framework of regional relations between the EU and the Andean Community, comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In 2007, negotiations aimed at concluding a comprehensive Association Agreement between the EU and the Andean Community were formally launched. Such Agreements cover all facets of relations between the EU and these countries, including political dialogue, economic cooperation and trade. However, as not all member states of the Andean Community were in a position to proceed with free trade negotiations, the decision was taken to commence negotiations on a multiparty Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and two member states of the Andean Community &mdash; Colombia and Peru &mdash; within the overall framework of the Association Agreement. The negotiations were carried out by the European Commission on the basis of a mandate from the Council. The Commission announced on 1 March 2010 that negotiators had concluded talks on the key elements of the trade Agreement.</P>
        <P>Colombia faces many challenges. It has experienced the longest period of terrorist violence of any country in Latin America. The Colombian people have endured relentless suffering reflected in the more than two million internally displaced persons, a number second only to that of Sudan.</P>
        <P>There is no single solution for promoting peace in Colombia; the various social and economic elements underlying the conflict have to be tackled simultaneously. Our approach and that of the European Union is to assist and influence the Colombian Government in a manner that results in economic and social development while progressively improving human rights standards. The conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Colombia will contribute significantly to the social and economic development of Colombia, which is imperative if it is to emerge from its violent past.</P>
        <P>I am aware of and share the deep concern that has been expressed at the manner in which trade union activists, human rights defenders and journalists have been treated in Colombia. I wish to assure the Deputy that there is no question of strengthening economic ties with Colombia at the expense of human rights. I am of the view that continuing the FTA negotiations with Colombia at this time offers the best opportunity to ensure that the concerns of EU Member States at the human rights situation in that country and, in particular, the treatment of trade union activists are fully addressed by the Colombian government<b><i>.</i></b></P>
        <P>I would like to put on record the steps which Ireland has taken over the past year in addressing human rights issues directly with the Government of Colombia and together with the European Union.</P>
        <P>First, in December 2008, at the <i>Universal Periodic Review </i>of Colombia at the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland made a set of strong recommendations <i>inter alia</i> on the protection of Human Rights Defenders in Colombia. Foreign Minister Bermudez subsequently wrote to me outlining in detail the steps that Colombia has undertaken particularly in response to Ireland&rsquo;s recommendations at the Human Rights Council.</P>
        <P>Secondly, the Irish Ambassador to Colombia met with President Urib&eacute;, Foreign Minister Bermudez and senior officials in Bogota in November 2009 and raised a range of human rights issues, in particular the question of the number of trade unionists killed in recent years. The Colombian side acknowledged the difficulties they are facing with regard to the protection of <Col N="854"/>human rights but outlined the steps being taken such as trebling the budget of the Protection Programme for Human Rights Defenders to $47 million in 2009. This permitted the extension of the Protection Programme to cover trade unionists and journalists. Indeed in the first half of 2009, the Protection Programme benefited 1,430 trade unionists.</P>
        <P>Thirdly, the Government&rsquo;s concerns were raised with the Colombian Ambassador when he visited Dublin to present his credentials last month.</P>
        <P>Fourthly, Ireland has insisted on the inclusion of a clause committing both the EU Member States and Colombia to the implementation of their human rights responsibilities with the proviso that failure to do would result in the suspension of the Agreement.</P>
        <P>And finally, I wrote to the EU Trade Commissioner in January to underline the importance I attach to the inclusion of a strong and effective human rights and suspension clause as an essential element of the Agreement.</P>
        <P>In addition to the bilateral track, the European Union has stepped up its human rights dialogue with the Colombian authorities who have been left in no doubt about the seriousness of our concerns regarding the human rights situation and the extent of the improvements needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to closely follow the human rights situation in Colombia and take the steps we consider necessary bilaterally as well as in cooperation with our EU partners.</P>

	<P>On 24 February, the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, delivered a statement in the House of Commons in which he apologised for the support given by successive British Governments for child migration schemes under which children aged between three and fourteen were sent to Australia, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand. The schemes ceased operating in the 1960s. Prime Minister Brown described the schemes as misguided and announced the establishment of a Family Restoration Fund of &pound;6 million. The statement followed a similar public apology made in November 2009 by the Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, for the manner in which the children were treated when they arrived in Australia.</P><Col N="856"/>
        <P>These statements represent a very significant acknowledgement of the suffering experienced by child migrants.  The British post World War II scheme of child migration was not supported by the Irish Government of the day and there was no involvement in the scheme by the Irish authorities. While the number of Irish born children is not thought to be large, it is widely accepted that a significant number of the deported children may have been born to Irish mothers.</P>
        <P>Following Prime Minister Brown&rsquo;s apology, our Embassy in London approached the British authorities to seek information on the number of Irish born child migrants but were advised that such official figures are not available. However, our contacts have undertaken to revert once they have consulted further with the British Department of Health.</P>
        <P>Our Embassy in Australia has had contact with a number of individual child migrants who were either born in Ireland or trace their background to Ireland. The Embassy will continue to maintain contact with the Irish child migrants in Australia and to provide support and assistance where possible.</P>
        <P>The Government, through the Emigrant Support Programme, supports Irish community organisations in each of the countries to which child migrants were sent; including for the provision of welfare assistance and outreach to elderly Irish emigrants.</P>

This information is then made available immediately to police forces worldwide in the Interpol database to protect against the fraudulent use of these Irish passports.</P>
        <P>The holders of lost/mislaid or stolen passports are advised not to use them again for any travel if they are subsequently recovered. When completing the statement of loss as part of their new passport application, applicants undertake not to travel on a missing passport if subsequently found. However, a number of individuals either unknowingly or mistakenly use their previously reported lost or stolen passports. This may account for the following numbers of Irish citizens who were delayed at international border control:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2008 &mdash; 87;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2009 &mdash; 126</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There has been increase in these incidents due to in part to heightened security at international ports and airports and an increase in the number of border stations worldwide that are electronically reading passports.</P><Col N="857"/>
        <P>In each of the cases above, the Passport Office has received a request from Interpol to verify the identity of the travellers. The Passport Office has been able to resolve these cases after checks of the relevant passport details against its own database were carried out.</P>
        <P>The documents used by the suspects in a recent murder in Dubai were not lost or stolen Irish passports but rather counterfeit copies of an old version of the passport that is no longer issued and is currently being phased out of use. In 2005 the Department introduced the new APS version of the Irish passport which is one of the most modern and secure travel documents in the world.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the biometric or e-Passport on 16 October, 2006 further enhanced the security features of the Irish passport. The microchip in the passport contains a digital image of the holder which cannot be altered. Any attempt to alter the data on the microchip will be apparent when the passport is read at a border control station because of the added security on our chip. Border control authorities can be assured that the document is genuine and unaltered.</P>
        <P>To complement the major technical advance which the APS passport represented, new legislation was enacted in 2008. The Passports Act 2008 introduced a series of new offences relating to the misuse of passports and passport fraud.</P>

        <Quest> the stage of the association agreement between the European Union and Syria; the reason there has been a delay in signing an agreement; and if account has been taken of the fact that the EU is Syria&rsquo;s biggest trading partner and that only Syria and Libya of the Mediterranean countries do not have an association agreement with the European Union. </Quest>

	<P>Negotiations on an Association Agreement with Syria began in May 1998 on the basis of a mandate agreed by the Council of Ministers. The text of a draft Agreement was initialled by the Commission and Syria in 2004 and submitted for approval to the Council. The Council did not approve signature of the Agreement at the time because of concerns regarding Syria&rsquo;s policies towards Lebanon. In the light of more positive developments in Syria&rsquo;s regional policy, consensus within the EU emerged that the draft Agreement previously negotiated should be updated with a view to its signature and eventual conclusion. The text of the revised draft Agreement was initialled by the Commission and Syria on 14 December 2008.</P>
        <P>The EU extended an invitation to Syria to sign the Agreement in Brussels on 26 October 2009. However, the Syrian authorities declined the invitation and advised that they required more time to study the impact of the Agreement on economic sectors in Syria. They undertook to remain in contact and to keep the EU informed of developments.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Spanish Presidency is now working towards signature during the first half of this year.</P>
        <P>The Agreement aims to promote a new, closer relationship between the EU and Syria. By establishing a free trade area between the EU and Syria over a transitional period it seeks to support economic and political reform in Syria, while preparing the country for greater integration into the world economy and promoting regional integration. It will enable the EU to engage in discussions with Syria on all topics of mutual concern, in particular human rights and democratic principles, combating terrorism and cooperation on countering the proliferation of weapons of mass-destruction.</P><Col N="858"/>
        <P>Syria is the only one of the southern members of the Union for the Mediterranean with which an Association Agreement is not yet in force. Negotiations on a Framework Agreement with Libya, which is not a member of the Union for the Mediterranean, commenced on 13 November 2008 and are ongoing.</P>
        <P>I regard the Association Agreement with Syria, which is the product of long negotiations, to be of mutual benefit to both the EU and Syria. It is my hope that the Syrian authorities will soon be in a position to move forward on the signature of the Agreement.</P>

        <P>The 2008 Passports Act provides strict guidelines on the proper procedures to be followed with regards to the issuing of Irish passport and Section 12 of that Act stipulates very clearly that only Irish citizens can be issued with Irish passports.

        <P>I would like to reassure the Deputy that safeguarding the integrity of the Irish passport is of paramount importance both to my Department and to me. We in Ireland are rightly proud of the esteem in which the Irish passport is held across the world and I would never condone any action whatsoever that would undermine its credibility.</P>

	<P>As I have previously outlined, a review of RAPID area boundaries has been undertaken with the intention of allowing adjustments necessary to ensure that areas are appropriately targeting the most disadvantaged communities.</P>
        <P>A recognised expert in the field of mapping deprivation was contracted to analyse the Census 2006 data across a range of socio-economic and deprivation indicators and to make recommendations regarding the criteria for inclusion of areas in the RAPID Programme.</P>
        <P>Following the review, the Government approved the inclusion of five new towns in the RAPID Programme in May 2009 &mdash; Ballina, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Mullingar and Rathkeale &mdash; and I have held information sessions in the five new towns over the last few months.</P>
        <P>The review also proposed changes to the boundaries of some of the other 46 RAPID areas. In this regard, I held a meeting with all of the RAPID local Area Implementation Teams (AITs) in January last to brief them on this process.  Each AIT has been requested to examine the proposals <Col N="861"/>and to either confirm their agreement or to make suggestions for amendments, based on their local knowledge. This work is underway and a number of areas have requested amendments and these are currently being examined.</P>
        <P>Overall, it should be noted that in implementing funding allocations based on RAPID boundaries, care has always been taken to ensure that key local facilities (sports clubs, health facilities, schools, etc) are offered RAPID status based on the population they serve &mdash; not just on their geographic inclusion within the area. Thus, for example, an AIT can accept the need to support an organisation which, while physically located outside a RAPID area, is actively serving RAPID residents.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two issues of public concern raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question. Firstly, there is the practice of non-charities representing themselves as charities when collecting clothing and bric-a-brac from residences. Secondly, there is the public nuisance that can be caused by undertaking such collections at anti-social hours.</P>
        <P>At present, certain collectors of clothing and bric-a-brac convey the impression in their promotional literature that they are charitable in nature, when this may not actually be the case. This may lead some people to donate to such collections in the belief that they are supporting a charity.  I consider that this is unfair both to donors, whose intention in donating such items is to help those in need, and to genuine charities, and in particular charity shops, that are reportedly losing out on donations as a consequence. I believe strongly that the public should be empowered to verify the charitable bona fides of such collectors.</P>
        <P>At present, there is no public register of charities operating in Ireland, although the Revenue Commissioners publish a list of current &ldquo;CHY&rdquo; holders &mdash; organisations that have qualified for <Col N="862"/>charitable tax exemptions &mdash; on their website, www.revenue.ie, which is publicly accessible. I would recommend that members of the public check this list if they have concerns about the authenticity of any collector.</P>
        <P>However, the Charities Act 2009, which I brought to enactment last year, will, when fully commenced, address this problem substantively.  The cornerstone of the new statutory regulatory regime for charities will be a Charities Regulatory Authority with extensive regulatory powers and a publicly accessible Register of Charities upon which any charity operating in Ireland must be registered.  It will be an offence for any organisation that is not on the Register of Charities to describe itself or its activities in such a way as to lead the public to assume that the organisation is a registered charity.  This will limit the scope for non-charities to suggest that they are charitable in nature.  By checking the Register, the public will be in a position to distinguish between charitable and non-charitable collections, and to make better-informed decisions about which collections they choose to support. The commencement of this provision is contingent upon both the new Authority and the Register of Charities being in place, and my Department is rolling out an implementation plan for the Act at the moment.</P>
        <P>The second aspect of public concern raised by the Deputy is the nuisance caused to the public by certain collectors delivering leaflets or undertaking collections at irregular hours. Whilst I do agree that the methods of certain collectors leave a lot to be desired, I have no statutory function in relation to such matters. I understand, however, that local authorities have powers under the Waste Management Act 1996 to enable them to control collections where they are of the opinion that such waste collections are being undertaken for the purposes of reward, with a view to profit, or otherwise in the course of business. Such collections require a permit from a local authority for each region in which a collection is to be undertaken.</P>

	<P>Section 61 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 provides that a true copy of an entry in any register must be provided to any person upon payment of a prescribed fee.</P>
        <P>Accordingly a certificate of birth, death or marriage must contain the fada or other accent where it is contained in the entry in the register.  The details of an entry in a register are as provided by a qualified informant prior to registration.</P>
        <P>The current computerised registration system was introduced in 2003 and it replaced the manual system.  While this system is highly successful and does cater for the fada, it does not cater for some characters or accents particular to some European and other languages for the purposes of registration.  Consequently, the absence of these is also reflected in certificates of entries where relevant.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 328 and 346 together.</P>
        <P>The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund exists to support workers who lose their jobs as a result of changing global trade patterns or the global economic and financial crisis so that they can be prepared to find another job as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>An application was made by Ireland, and recently approved by EU, in the context of the DELL redundancies in Raheen, Co. Limerick. It is estimated that up to 2,900 workers are involved when qualifying downstream companies affected by this closure are included and a combined total of &euro;2.8 million is available, between EU and Government funding, to provide complementary retraining, upskilling, entrepreneurial supports and educational opportunities for the relevant workers. The allocated funding will be available for spending until September 2011.</P>
        <P>Under the terms associated with the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), it is not envisaged in general that any monies from the fund will be paid directly to former Dell workers. Therefore, the social welfare entitlements of the former workers will not be affected as no money will be directly received. Instead funding is being channelled through the relevant State agencies and educational institutions to deliver the required supports to eligible redundant workers.</P>
        <P>Workers who were made statutorily redundant from Dell may retain their jobseekers payments while attending education or training courses under the terms of the Back to Education schemes operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. BTEA participants attending an approved full-time course can keep their jobseekers payments for the duration of that course (which may be a number of years). Those who participate in an approved part-time course can receive welfare support for as long as they would ordinarily be entitled to a jobseekers payment (9-12 months in the case of those on Jobseekers Benefit, or longer for those who qualify for the <Col N="865"/>means-tested Jobseekers Allowance). These provisions equally apply to workers studying HETAC or FETAC accredited third level courses at private colleges.</P>
        <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment is the responsible authority for making EGF applications and drawing down EU funding. That department is also working with FAS to make a range of programmes available to the former Dell employees. The package of programmes is currently being finalised. Department of Social and Family Affairs officials are involved at central and local level these matters.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the number of persons under 25 years on the live register who do not hold a leaving certificate qualification; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department does not currently hold information in relation to the educational qualifications of its customers, though such information will be collected under the new statistical profiling and case management systems currently being developed.</P>
        <P>However, when jobseekers are interviewed by FAS under the National Employment Action Plan or meet with one of this department&rsquo;s facilitators, their existing qualifications are discussed and possible options, such as the Back to Education Allowance, would be outlined to them.</P>
        <P>The Back to Education Allowance is a second chance educational opportunities scheme for people on welfare payments who wish to participate in full time education and who would not otherwise be able to do so. It enables qualified people who have been getting a social welfare payment to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course.  Young people who have been out of the formal education system for at least two years may qualify for the Back to Education Allowance once they have been in receipt of a jobseekers payment for at least three months.</P>
        <P>BTEA recipients can attend a second-level course of education at any secondary, community, comprehensive or vocational school.  The course must be full-time and lead to a certificate recognised by the Department of Education and Science or approved by the Further Education and Training Awards Council.</P>

In order to address the additional demands on the Department arising from the increase in the Live Register and associated matters, the Government introduced a staff levy to transfer resources from other Government Departments and Offices to this Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 371 and 372 together.</P>
        <P>Self-employed people are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s payments &mdash; these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P.  This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these same persons enjoy.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</P>
        <P>There are no immediate plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers.  Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context. Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.</P>
        <P>Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as Jobseekers Allowance.  They can apply for the means-tested Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year.  In the current climate, however, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  It is accepted that future earnings may be lower than those of previous years and this is factored in projecting future earnings, with account being taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.</P>
        <P>The Department does not maintain statistics of the type sought by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>In recognition of the devastation suffered by people in many areas of the country as a result of the flooding from November 2009 onwards, the Government set up a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme to provide income tested financial support to people who have suffered damages to their homes not covered by insurance. Community Welfare Service staff in Galway have been providing support to families since this flooding occurred. Up to the 19th February 2010 they had made 718 payments to 328 individuals to the value of &euro;289,000.</P>
        <P>Initially, the vast bulk of applications for humanitarian assistance were for small amounts to assist with basics such as clothing, food, bedding, heating, hire of dehumidifiers and emergency accommodation needs. Payments have also been made in respect of essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods. Assistance is also available for structural repairs to homes not covered by household insurance.</P>
        <P>Very few large scale claims have been made at this stage as homeowners have not yet established the cost of repair. In many cases, they are awaiting builders estimates. It is expected that large scale claims will be received over the coming weeks. These claims will take somewhat longer to process as they will require verification of the loss and the possible use of a loss assessor.</P>
        <P>The level of payment available under the aid scheme to any qualified individual depends on the severity of the damage to that person&rsquo;s home and the extent of the loss experienced as well as household income and general family circumstances. The scheme provides hardship alleviation as opposed to full compensation. As on previous occasions, commercial or business losses are not covered by the scheme nor are losses which are covered by household insurance.</P>
        <P>Applications under the scheme are being income tested to ensure that available assistance is prioritised for those who are most vulnerable. The basic objective of the income test is to determine the household&rsquo;s capacity to meet the costs of restoring their home to a habitable condition. All household income is considered when determining entitlement to payment.</P>
        <P>People seeking assistance should contact their local Community Welfare Office. Further information and applications forms in relation to the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme are available from the Community Welfare Service in the affected areas and from the Department&rsquo;s website ( www.welfare.ie) and the HSE&rsquo;s website (www.hse.ie).</P>

        <P>On 20 December 2001, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1386 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, authorising the establishment of an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. Ireland has participated in the NATO&ndash;led UN mandated mission since 5 July 2002, following the Government Decision of 2 July 2002, authorising the provision of seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the force. Since 2002, the Government has reviewed and approved, on an annual basis, the continued participation by seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF.</P>
        <P>The seven Irish personnel currently participating in ISAF, comprising 4 Officers and 3 Non-Commissioned Officers, are located in the two ISAF Headquarters in Kabul. The Irish personnel work in staff appointments in planning and administrative roles.  Irish personnel are rotated every 6 months.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government gives a clear commitment to the implementation of effective waste management policies based on the international waste hierarchy which places greatest emphasis <Col N="879"/>on waste prevention, minimisation and reuse.  We must continue to reduce our reliance on landfill and this requires an intensive focus on the upper tiers of the waste hierarchy.</P>
        <P>Policy and legislation on packaging waste, both at national and European level, is based on the principles of minimising harm to the environment while maximising the efficient use of resources.  In this context, my Department is involved in ongoing discussions with the retail sector with a view to developing proposals on packaging waste prevention as part of a wider agreement aimed at addressing that sector&rsquo;s environmental responsibilities.  It is envisaged that an agreement will be concluded by the end of 2010.</P>
        <P>There are already legal requirements in place in relation to packaging waste.  Article 9 of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste provides that packaging may not be placed on the market within the European Union unless it complies with the essential requirements as to the composition and the reusable and recoverable nature of packaging as provided for in Annex II to that Directive.  Article 28 of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2007 gives legal effect to the essential requirements of packaging in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In broad terms, the essential requirements provide that packaging must be prevented so that only the minimum amount necessary is used for the containment, protection, handling, delivery and presentation of goods.  Furthermore, packaging must be recoverable &mdash; either by means of material recycling, energy recovery, composting or by biodegradation.  Under article 18 of the Directive, Member States are prohibited from impeding the placing on the market of packaging which satisfies these essential requirements.</P>

The Act provides that the liability date for 2010 and future years is 31 March 2010.</P>
        <P>Payment does not fall due until two months after the liability date and there is a further one month&rsquo;s grace period before penalties for late payment commence.  A person liable for the charge in 2010 thus has until 30 June 2010 to meet that liability without incurring any additional charge.  I have no plans to extend this period.</P><Col N="880"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 398 and 414 together.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development Regulations 2001, define a shop as a structure used for, <i>inter alia</i>, the retail sale of goods where the sale, display or service is principally to visiting members of the public, but excluding, <i>inter alia</i>, any use associated with the provision of funeral services or as a funeral home, or as a hotel, a restaurant or a public house, or for the sale of hot food for consumption off the premises, except where the sale of such food is subsidiary to the main retail use.  Article 10 of the Regulations provides that, with certain exceptions, development which consists of a change of use within any one of the classes of use specified in Part 4 of Schedule 2 is exempted development.  Class 1 of Part 4 of Schedule 2 is use as a shop and accordingly the effect of these provisions was that change of use from one type of shop to another type of shop was exempted development.</P>
        <P>In the Planning and Development Regulations 2005, the definition of shop was amended to exclude a use for the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption off the premises (except where the sale of such liquor is subsidiary to the main retail use).  The effect of these amendments was that an off-licence no longer came within the definition of a shop and accordingly change of use from an off-licence to a shop was no longer exempted development and would in future require planning permission.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy has asked me to look at how the planning system might support the Department of Health <Col N="882"/>regulatory response to the issue of so-called &ldquo;head shops&rdquo;; the issue is currently under consideration in my Department.</P>

Legislation will be required to give effect to this commitment. In October 2009, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) found that Ireland failed to make adequate legislation for dealing with domestic wastewater from septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems. My Department is currently considering the measures necessary to comply with the ECJ ruling and legislation will be required in this regard also.

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland is a non-nuclear state.  The Government does not believe that nuclear power is the answer to our energy needs, and would prefer instead to see greater emphasis on renewable energy sources.  As a non-nuclear state, Ireland does not stand to receive any of the claimed benefits from the current wave of developments in nuclear energy, but must still bear any trans-boundary risks which might arise from these facilities. In view of this, the Government continues to press for the fullest possible information from the UK authorities on any activities that might contribute to that risk.</P>
        <P>Following direct contact with the UK Ambassador in relation to the UK&rsquo;s nuclear development proposals last November, I have asked my Department to maintain regular contact with the relevant UK Government Departments and Agencies on nuclear safety and radiological protection matters, including in particular the UK&rsquo;s proposed new build programme.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) also has regular contact with the regulatory bodies responsible for radiological protection and nuclear safety in the UK, and meets frequently with my Department to discuss these matters.</P>
        <P>Through these ongoing contacts, I am informed of key policy developments with regard to nuclear power in the UK, including proposals for the development of new nuclear power stations <Col N="885"/>at up to ten sites, seven of which are on the coast of the Irish Sea. Arising from my and the Government&rsquo;s concerns at these proposals, I have written to the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, outlining key concerns and seeking further information predominantly on safety and waste issues associated with the proposals.  My Department&rsquo;s priority in all discussions with the UK on its nuclear energy programme is the safety of the Irish people and the protection of our environment, particularly the shared marine environment of the Irish Sea.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>In February 2009, I announced my intention to review the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 under which the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) operates. The purpose of this review is to consider whether the Act best supports the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions and whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector. In November 2009 I announced the preliminary results of this review, including recommendations in a number of key areas, with an overall emphasis on streamlining and simplifying the Act and reducing delays.</P>
        <P>While a range of issues still remain to be considered, I intend to initiate comprehensive amending legislation within the next 12 months. Among the main issues that I have to address in the amending legislation are:</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A statutory objective of 6 months to be set for the issuing of determination orders arising out of dispute resolution applications,</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Board of the PRTB to be reduced from 15 to 12 members,</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The introduction of fixed fines where deposits are illegally retained by landlords,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Measures to address non-payment of rent by tenants during a dispute process, in particular to introduce scope for the legal termination of such a tenancy,</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the Board,</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The inclusion within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act of segments of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector that most closely parallel the current remit of the Board.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A number of issues requiring further research, including third party complaints under the Act, the Act&rsquo;s engagement with anti-social behaviour and how best to address issues surrounding the retention of deposits, will also be considered in detail. In addition, all opportunities for the introduction of time and procedural efficiencies in the Act will be examined.</P>
        <P>The PRTB, which commenced operations in September 2004, is at present outside the scope of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. Given the importance of openness and transparency in relation to the operation of State bodies generally it is my intention that the Board, subject to exemptions that recognise its quasi-judicial functions, should come under the scope of the Free<Col N="886"/>dom of Information legislation.   I will be seeking to give effect to this in the context of the next set of proposals for the extension of the Freedom of Information Act to additional public bodies, to be brought forward by my colleague the Minister for Finance, who has overall responsibility for the Freedom of Information legislative code.</P>

	<P>My Department has a delegated sanction from the Department of Finance for implementation of the general moratorium on the filling of public sector posts in the Local Authority Sector, on the condition that the overall staffing levels in the local authority sector are to be reduced significantly by the end of 2010 in adherence to the Government&rsquo;s Policy on Staffing and Numbers in the Public Sector.  Under the new arrangements which issued to the local authority sector on 20 August 2009, Local Authorities are expected, where vacancies arise, to consider options for reorganisation and reallocation of work to meet requirements. Any exceptions to this principle, which will arise in very limited circumstances, require sanction from my Department.</P>
        <P>Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible, including the employment of outdoor staff and general operatives, in compliance with the relevant public sector recruitment and employment law requirements.</P>

	<P>All local authorities were asked in July 2009 to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services in their areas to my Department by 23 October 2009.  My Department is currently finalising its consideration of these assessments, including the response from Kildare County Council, which form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 Water Services Investment Programme.   In conducting their assessments, local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.  I expect to publish the Water Services Investment Programme 2010 to 2012 shortly.    </P>

This sanction was granted, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, on the basis that repayments would be wholly from the Authority&rsquo;s own resources and without recourse to the Exchequer.  The Authority is operating within its borrowing sanction.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On 23 April 2009, I announced that the Government had decided not to proceed with implementation of electronic voting in Ireland. Since then, a process has been put in place to address the issues that arise from the decision. An Interdepartmental Task Force, chaired by my Department, has been established to bring the project to an orderly conclusion and to oversee disposal of the equipment and termination of storage arrangements.  The Task Force, which met three times in 2009, and is due to meet this month, aims to complete its work as soon as possible. Between meetings, my Department maintains ongoing contact with members of the Task Force, in order to progress work on the cessation arrangements for the project.</P>
        <P>In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach, with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of cost possible in the circumstances, consistent with environmental and other obligations.  Detailed consideration of all relevant factors is underway to inform the manner in which disposal of the machines will be effected.  This includes contact with the original suppliers of the machines.  The total expenditure on the development and roll-out of the electronic voting system to date is some &euro;51.346 million, the bulk of which has been incurred in purchasing the voting machines and ancillary equipment.  These costs are set out in the following table.</P>

	<P>I have no function in the operational matters of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), an independent statutory body established under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. In February 2009 I announced my intention to review the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 under which the PRTB operates. I announced the preliminary results of this review, in November 2009 including recommendations in a number of key areas, with an overall emphasis on streamlining and simplifying the Act, reducing delays and achieving additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of its functions. While a range of issues still remain to be considered, I intend to initiate comprehensive amending legislation within the next 12 months. Full details in relation to the background to the review, the associated terms of reference and the preliminary results of the review are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.environ.ie. </P>
        <P>Among the main issues that I hope to address in the amending legislation are&mdash;</P>

	<P>While the National Spatial Strategy makes a broad reference to the potential for the development of wind energy, the strategic development of wind energy is more fully addressed in Regional Planning Guidelines (RPGs) which guide the development plans of local authorities within their regions.  New RPGs are currently being finalised with a view to their adoption mid-year.  As stated in the reply to Question Nos. 195, 196, 197 and 198  of 17 February, my Department&rsquo;s Wind Energy Development Guidelines issued to planning authorities in June 2006, and available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>, provide comprehensive advice to planning authorities on catering for wind energy through the development plan process. </P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) provides funding to approved housing bodies of up to 100% of the approved costs of accommodation for older people, the homeless, persons with special needs, returning emigrants and victims of domestic violence.  To date, my Department has not received any application for a project under CAS at this location.  I understand, however, that Cork City Council received an initial proposal for such a project on 1 October 2009.  My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the CAS relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects.  The detailed administration of the scheme, including the certification that projects comply with its terms and conditions, the processing of applications and the payment of capital grants in respect of approved housing projects, are the responsibility of the local authority.  It is therefore a matter for Cork City Council to progress this project in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CAS.</P>

	<P>The European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006 &mdash; 2008 established the Building Energy Rating (BER) scheme under which a BER certificate must be obtained whenever a dwelling is commissioned or is subject to an offer for sale or letting.  Compliance with this statutory obligation in relation to its own social housing stock is a matter for each individual local authority.  While Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), the designated issuing authority under the Regulations, maintains a database of valid BER certificates, this database does not distinguish between privately or publicly owned dwellings.  My Department, therefore, is not in a position to supply the required statistical information.</P>

        <P>In April 2009, following a review of the Serviced Land Initiative in light of developments in the economy at large, and in the housing market in particular during 2008, and having regard to the oversupply of housing in some areas, my Department informed all local authorities that the Initiative was being discontinued.  All existing scheme approvals under the Initiative, for which contracts had not been signed or letters of intent had not issued, were withdrawn. Local authorities were however also informed that where they were of the opinion that the continuation of a scheme was necessary for the proper development of an area, it was open to them to make a case to the Department for the scheme to progress. Wexford County Council has in response resubmitted the schemes in question. My Department has assessed the responses received and the decisions on the schemes to progress will be conveyed to the relevant local authorities in light of the finalisation of the Water Services Investment Programme for the period 2010 to 2012, which I expect to publish shortly.</P>

	<P>I understand the Deputy is referring to the special local licences fees set, in the northern and north western fisheries regions, by the Special Tidal Waters (Special Local Licences) (Alteration of Duties) Order 2009 (SI No 538 of 2009).  That Order amended, inter alia, the Rivers Owenmore and Owenduff (Special Local Licences) Order 1967 (SI No 34 of 1967).  Those rivers are located in the North Western fisheries region.  I am pleased to remind the House that the Orders provided for a 10% reduction in all salmon fishing licence fees, a reduction applied nationally to commercial and recreational salmon fishing licences.  However, notwithstanding the benefits conferred by that order, the pre-existing differential in licence fees remains.</P><Col N="901"/>
        <P>Having regard to the long-standing nature of these differentials, it is my intention to ask the new national inland fisheries authority, Inland Fisheries Ireland, upon establishment, to examine the structure of these licences and make recommendations on the matter.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> if he has examined and had discussions with his Cabinet colleagues regarding the recently published Forf&aacute;s report on broadband which details the extent of broadband connection in rural Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Forf&aacute;s report acknowledges that urbanisation and population density are crucial determinants of the economic case for investing in broadband infrastructure and that the case for such investment is likely to be more attractive in countries with a high proportion of people living in urban areas and high population density.  The report notes that by contrast, Ireland has a high proportion of people living in rural areas.</P>
        <P>This reality is reflected in the range of broadband interventions undertaken by the Government to provide broadband service to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to do so on a commercial basis.  Under the most recent initiative my Department entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) in late December 2008.  Since then, 3 has progressed its network rollout and NBS broadband services are now available in almost half of the 1,028 designated Electoral Divisions (ED) to be covered under the Scheme.  Under the NBS contract, all EDs in the NBS Coverage Area are required to have broadband connectivity by end September 2010.</P>
        <P>It is accepted that even after the full roll-out of the NBS there will still be a small percentage of premises outside of the Electoral Divisions covered by the scheme that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  In this context, my Department is currently <Col N="902"/>considering the detailed design and implementation of a scheme which would utilise these funds to address the issue of broadband availability to unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.</P>

        <P>Government policy pertaining to the electronic communications market in Ireland is set out in &ldquo;Next Generation Broadband &mdash; Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland&rdquo;, which I published in June 2009.  The policy paper was developed in accordance with various key principles, which are crucial to the development of the market.  The policy paper sets out the Government&rsquo;s position that investment in broadband infrastructure is primarily a matter for the private sector, facilitated, where appropriate and possible, by Government.  ComReg continues to review the level of investment being made by various operators and has a clear role in trying to provide a suitable investment environment especially for next generation networks.</P>
        <P>Direct State investment is aimed at market failure situations &mdash; hence initiatives such as the Metropolitan Area Networks Programme and, more recently, the National Broadband Scheme which is aimed at bringing a broadband service to unserved areas.  We will continue the levels of <Col N="904"/>investment by both the private and public sectors to support the key objective we have in providing a suitable broadband network for the country.</P>

	<P>The Single Payment Scheme and other EU-funded Schemes are governing by relevant EU legislation. The financial ceilings under the Single Payment Scheme are assigned to the individual Member States, for use within those individual Member States. Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) 73/2009, which establishes the common rules on direct payments, including the Single Payment, defines a &lsquo;holding&rsquo; as all the production units managed by a farmer within the territory of the same Member State. </P>
        <P>However, when the Single Payment Scheme was implemented in the EU, special provision was made for farmers with land situated in more than one Member State. In Ireland, for example, farmers with land situated in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and who were claiming aid under the Livestock Premia and Arable Aid Schemes in the Republic had the number of entitlements allocated to them based solely on the land situated in the Republic. That means that they can receive their full Single Farm Payment by only declaring the land situated in the Republic irrespective of whether they continued to farm the land situated in Northern Ireland.  These farmers are entitled to continue to farm the land situated in Northern Ireland but they do not require this land to benefit from the Single Farm Payment.</P>

The new legislation will amend and consolidate legislation in the area of animal health, particularly to reflect the changed disease status of our animals.

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of EID for sheep was agreed at EU level in late 2003. At that time, it was agreed to defer the implementation date until January 2008. The Council of Agriculture Ministers revisited this issue in December 2007 when it was agreed that the deadline for the compulsory introduction of EID should be set for 31 December 2009, six years after the original decision was taken.  </P>
        <P>The prevailing view at EU level is that Member States should now proceed with implementation and other Member States have proceeded with implementation of EID on a mandatory basis.  I, therefore, have no discretion as regards the date of implementation for electronic identification (EID) and there can be no question of deferring its introduction for a further period.  In these circumstances, we now must proceed with the introduction of EID.</P>
        <P>My Department has circulated a technical document outlining the proposed changes to the National Sheep Identification System (NSIS II) to farm organisations and other stakeholders for comments.  This is part of a consultative process, which has been ongoing for some time.  The stakeholders have been asked to examine this document carefully and engage with my officials so that whatever revisions are made to the NSIS best suit Irish conditions and minimise the burden on farmers within the parameters of the new legislation.</P>
        <P>If farmers do not comply with EU rules on electronic identification of sheep and with NSIS rules they will renders themselves liable to appropriate penalties. Farmers who are found to be non-compliant with the sheep identification requirements will, under the cross compliance obligations, also be liable to a reduction in their single payment, disadvantaged area and REPS payment depending on the seriousness of the non-compliance.</P>

	<P>Bord Bia, under the aegis of my Department, is the State agency responsible for the market development of food, seafood, drink and horticulture at home and abroad.  Its strategy is to expand exports of food, seafood, drinks and horticulture to &euro;10 billion and to develop home sales and sustainable jobs.  On the home market, Bord Bia&rsquo;s quality assurance schemes for various products enjoy 80% awareness. The Best in Season campaign, which promotes locally grown produce in season, will take place again in 2010, beginning in May to coincide with the beginning of Irish seasonal produce.  This campaign, the key messages of which are freshness, taste and health benefits, highlights the seasonal fruit and vegetables available in Ireland.  For example, press and digital media and a best in season website, <i>www.bestinseason.ie</i>, focus on strawberries in June, new season potatoes in July and seasonally available vegetables and potatoes in a &ldquo;back to school&rdquo; theme for September.  In addition, the Good Practice Standard and Flag for farmers&rsquo; markets, which was launched at the Bloom 2009 Festival, encourages farmers&rsquo; markets to provide market access to locally produced in-season produce.  Some 34 markets have to date been certified as meeting the Good Practice Standard for farmers&rsquo; markets and each has been issued with a personalised banner it can use to advertise this achievement.  A list of the successful markets is posted on the Bord Bia website.  The Good Practice Standard encourages farmers&rsquo; markets to provide market access to locally produced in-season produce.  Producers can deal directly with consumers and people have an opportunity to taste products with a particular local identity.  Markets displaying the banner will aim to source 50% of their produce in their county or neighbouring counties.  Farmers&rsquo; markets are a good alternative route to market particularly for small producers.  A new round of applications is under way at present.  It is expected that many more markets will have reached a standard that will enable them to apply in this third round.  One of Bord Bia&rsquo;s key strategies for 2010 is enhancing the position of Irish food and horticulture on the Irish market.  Bord Bia will assist suppliers through initiatives in consumer insight, innovation, and branding.  Promotion of the Bord Bia quality mark will be intensified to expand demand for quality assured meat, eggs and horticultural produce.  Bord Bia&rsquo;s vantage suite of services will continue to assist small food companies to grow local business and identify niche export opportunities, while also continuing <Col N="911"/>support for the development of the organic sector, farmers&rsquo; markets and food based growth opportunities and food tourism partnerships.</P>

	<P>The export of cattle, whether for slaughter, breeding or production, is a commercial matter, and subject to market demand and other economic variables. Under EU trade rules, and subject to veterinary health certification, there is free movement of such cattle from Ireland to every other Member State.</P>
        <P>Overall live exports in 2009 increased by 94% on 2008, with exports to the UK increasing by 159% and those to other EU destinations by 74%. In the period up to 21 February 2010 live exports are already over 300% ahead of the levels achieved during the same period in 2009. Within this, trade has been especially strong in cattle to Northern Ireland, calves to the Netherlands and weanlings to Italy and Spain. Over the full year it is anticipated that overall live exports should reach the highest level for many years.</P>
        <P>With a view to facilitating the live export trade, Bord Bia continues to work closely with the industry in monitoring and developing emerging opportunities and in resolving any outstanding difficulties.</P>

	<P>At the end of 2009 my Department estimates that 737,142 hectares of land was under forestry and that approximately 46% of this land is privately owned.  68,400 hectares of forest was licensed for harvesting since the year 2000, with the majority of this area being restocked. It should be noted that the period allowed for replanting is up to three years after the harvesting has taken place.</P>
        <P>As outlined in the Renewed Programme for Government, the Government is committed to maintaining the annual target of 30% broadleaf planting.</P>
