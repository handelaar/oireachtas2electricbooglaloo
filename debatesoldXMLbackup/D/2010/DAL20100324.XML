	<P>Before proceeding with the business of the day I wish to announce for the information of the House that I received a letter of resignation from Deputy Martin Cullen today, 24 March, as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the constituency of Waterford and I have laid the letter before the D&aacute;il.   In accordance with the provisions of Standing Order 167, the resignation took effect upon receipt of the letter this morning.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Before proceeding to Leaders&rsquo; Questions, I wish to bring an announcement to the attention of the House regarding ministerial and Minister of State appointments.  I wish to announce for the information of the D&aacute;il that having informed the President that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann had approved my nomination of Deputy Pat Carey and Deputy Tony Killeen to be Members of the Government, the Presidential Commission on 23 March 2010 appointed them accordingly.  Second, that on the same day I assigned responsibility for the Department of Education and Science to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Mary Coughlan, the Department of Social and Family Affairs to Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism to Deputy Mary Hanafin, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to Deputy Pat Carey and the Department of Defence to Deputy Tony Killeen.  Third, that on my nomination, the Government last night appointed the following to be Ministers of State and agreed other changes in the allocation of responsibilities to existing Ministers of State &mdash; Deputy John Curran to be Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence with special responsibility as Government Chief Whip, Deputy Dara Calleary to be Minister of State at the Departments of Taoiseach, Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibilities for public service transformation and labour affairs, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe to be Minister of State at the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Transport and Environment, Heritage and Local Government with special responsibility for horticulture, sustainable travel, planning and heritage, Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick to be Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with special responsibility for fisheries and forestry and Deputy Mary White to be Minister of State at the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Education and Science with special responsibility for equality, human rights and integration, and Deputy John Moloney <Col N="308"/>will continue as Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform with special responsibility for disability issues and mental heath.  I propose to nominate to the Government Deputies Cuffe, White and Connick to be Ministers of State.</P>

        <P>It seems as if queues have become an essential part of life in Ireland today, be it queues for passports, queues to emigrate or queues to get into accident and emergency departments throughout the country.  The only place it seems no queue is necessary is to get approval from the Department of Finance for pay increases in certain sections of banking and NAMA.</P>

	<P>The Irish people have had enough.  Some 800,000 people in the public and the private sector have taken serious pay cuts and some 200,000 people have lost their jobs.  This morning Anglo Irish Bank announced that it is to give pay increases to its staff both here and in Great Britain.  It said these staff are to be paid extra money because of extra responsibilities arising from redundancies.  This cannot be justified.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It goes to the very heart of the lack of fairness in this society in Ireland today under Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s disastrous reign as Taoiseach with his Government.  It goes to the very heart of that unfairness and it cannot be justified.  We cannot expect the Irish people to accept that the only sections that can get pay increases now are either those involved in NAMA or those involved in this bank, which is to be rescued again at an inordinate price when it brings in its disastrous results next week.  What the Taoiseach has done is to link these pay increases to a defective policy towards Anglo Irish Bank where the Irish public will be expected to bail them out again to the extent of possibly &euro;20 billion.  I ask the Taoiseach to justify in detail the reason he and his Government sanctioned wage increases for staff members in Anglo Irish Bank?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>These matters do not come up for sanction from the Government, as the Deputy knows or should know.</P>
        <P>On the particular issue, the chairman of the bank in question outlined this morning precisely the position.  There has been a reduction in numbers, extra responsibilities have been assigned to certain staff and there is a totally new management team in place.  The board has the Government&rsquo;s confidence in seeking to de-risk the bank and it is important that there are people <i>in situ</i> who can do that.  The chairman of the bank set out what was the position in relation to the matters raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree with him?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, the Taoiseach is wrong.  Section 50 of Statutory Instrument 411 of 2008 under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">A covered institution shall manage the business of its group at all times with a view to furthering the purposes of this Scheme and the Act of 2008.  . . . . the Minister may require certain obligations of this Scheme, as he or she may specify in writing to the covered institution, to apply to the parent of a covered institution or any member of its group as a condition of benefiting from this Scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Government took specific powers to deal with wages in respect of higher levels in the covered institutions.  Under this statutory instrument, which is part of the Bill passed by the House, the Minister took the authority to indicate in writing to a covered institution that if the scheme is being brought into disrepute, he can, in writing, instruct the covered institution in question to obtain and maintain certain obligations.  I charge that under section 50 of the Bill, which went through the House and gave the Government authority to deal with the banks, the Minister for Finance is entitled to instruct Anglo Irish Bank, in writing as per this section, that these wage increases, which cannot be and are not justified, should not be paid.  This is not the time to acknowledge increased responsibility with cash.  This matter goes to the very heart of what is unfair in this country under the Taoiseach&rsquo;s style of government.</P>
        <P>I charge that, under section 50 of the statutory instrument, where this scheme is being brought into disrepute in the eyes of members of the public the Taoiseach can instruct his Minister for Finance to require adherence to certain obligations.  No wage increase should be paid in circumstances in which a defective policy will result in the Government asking the public to write a cheque the Taoiseach stated would be written irrespective of the size of the sum involved.  Section 50 gives the Government authority and power in this matter and I ask the Taoiseach to use it.  Wage increases in Anglo Irish Bank cannot be justified, are not justified and will not be justified by Irish people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Anglo Irish Bank is being run at arm&rsquo;s length by the new management team and board.  This is in line with best practice.  A relationship framework is set out regarding what the Minister is responsible for and not responsible for in relation to the bank.  In the area of remuneration the Minister approves any changes to general remuneration, the pay of senior management and fees to directors.  As the staff affected by this decision are not senior management, decisions on their pay levels are a matter for management in the bank.  Just as the Minister does not set the pay levels for a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try one more time.  Just as the Minister does not set pay levels for a substation chief in the ESB, neither does he set pay levels for a person who is in charge of information technology in a bank.  That is in line with best practice. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The ESB is paying its way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The board and management of the bank have a serious job of work to do.  They are getting on with that job and seeking to de-risk the bank.  We need people in the bank to do the job.  The chairman set out in detail this morning what are the circumstances in relation to these matters.  The relationship framework sets out the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the chairman?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s powers in this matter are set out in the statutory instrument. </P>

	<P>The Taoiseach should be a leader. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>No substation manager in the ESB is responsible for the collapse of the Irish economy, nor is the ESB responsible for the collapse of Irish banking.  Anglo Irish Bank was at the heart of what went wrong in Irish banking and the economy and we ended up with the State having to take ownership of the bank.</P>
        <P>I was surprised to learn yesterday that 70 staff in Anglo Irish Bank had received a pay increase.  How much of a pay increase did they receive?  I presume that since this matter became knowledge yesterday some inquiries have been made of a bank that is owned by the State as to what level of increase was granted.</P>
        <P>Even if there was never a provision in the banking legislation to allow the Government to take action on this matter &mdash; there is such provision &mdash; does the Government not have a policy on pay in what is broadly described as the commercial State sector and, if so, does this policy not apply to Anglo Irish Bank, as it presumably applies to every other State body?  What is the Government&rsquo;s position on the making of pay increases in Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>With regard to the financial results of Anglo Irish Bank, the report for the 15 month period ending December 2009 was expected at the beginning of March 2010 but has not yet been produced.  When will it be produced?  Since the State owns the bank, will the Taoiseach indicate, at least in ball park figures, what is the extent of the losses incurred by the bank for the 15 month period in question?  According to newspaper reports, the bank lost &euro;14 billion in the period and we are informed its losses will be the highest ever reported by an Irish company.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the figure of &euro;14 billion is the extent of the losses?  If they are even remotely in that territory, will he try to explain how a company incurring losses of that magnitude can give an increase in pay to its staff?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is best practice. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach give some indication as to how much further Irish taxpayers will be asked to dig into their pockets and how much more they will pay over to a bank which has apparently decided to give a pay increase to its staff?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="311"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issues related to the annual report, it will be a matter for the bank to publish the report in due course.  As the Deputy stated, the report is imminent.  On that matter, the Minister for Finance has indicated he will come to the House with a full indication of Government policy on any decisions that have to be made and recapitalisation proposals that have to be considered in due course.</P>
        <P>As I stated to Deputy Kenny, the pay increases are a management matter.  The bank has a totally new management team and board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Losses of &euro;14 billion have nothing to do with the Government. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, extra responsibilities have been given to some specialist staff in the bank.  I do not have the details of that, which is a matter for the management and board of the bank.  The issue, from the Government&rsquo;s point of view, is that in respect of what emerges as a result of what has happened in the bank, we want to ensure the taxpayer is protected to the greatest possible extent. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the taxpayer protected?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the whole focus of the management and board of the bank.  The board enjoys the confidence of the Government in seeking to do this serious task and the chairman set out the position this morning. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an incredible reply.  I asked for simple information, namely, how much are the pay increases, how much losses Anglo Irish Bank has made, even in ball park terms, and how much more will we be asked to put into the bank.  The Taoiseach indicated that we will be given this information in due course and that pay and other issues related to the bank are matters for its management and board as if this were some perfectly functioning, prosperous, profitable company doing its business.  This is the zombie bank, the rotten apple at the heart of what happened in the Irish banking system, which gave rise to the collapse in our economy, for which people all over the country have been paying for the past 18 months with their jobs, in their pay packets and living standards and in the quality of services being produced.  This is not a matter for the management and board of the bank.  This is a matter for the Government because it owns the bank. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is head of the Government that now owns a bank which, having apparently made &euro;14 billion losses in the past 15 months, has just announced it has given a pay increase to some of its staff.  The Taoiseach cannot tell us the size of the pay increase and will not tell us the size of the losses, yet he comes into the Chamber and tells us that this has nothing to do with anything, it is a bank and, therefore, is a matter for the management and the board.  This is of public interest.  </P>
        <P>I can refer to another provision so that the Taoiseach can do something about this, namely, the legislation that nationalised Anglo Irish Bank.  The Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009 states the Minister may give a direction in writing to Anglo Irish Bank, requiring it to do, or refrain from doing, anything which, in the opinion of the Minister, is necessary or expedient in the public interest.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Finance today to give a direction to this bank to refrain from paying these increases until we find out officially how much this bank has lost in the past 15 months and how much more of the taxpayers&rsquo; hard earned money it will come back to look for and at least until the matter can be considered in the normal way? <Col N="312"/> It is very easy to say it is a matter for the management and the board.  The management and the board are not putting up the pony here.  It is the taxpayer who is putting up the money for the losses and the extra pay.  The Act that allowed the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank gives the Minister for Finance the power to give a direction in this situation.</P>
        <P>I have a direct question for the Taoiseach.  Will the Minister for Finance today give a direction to the bank not to proceed with those pay increases until, at the very least, we find out the full story about this rotten bank and the extent to which the taxpayer must pony up for it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is being very unfair to both the new management team and the new board in the bank who are acting on behalf of the taxpayer.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are acting on behalf of the Government and the taxpayer to ensure we seek to protect to the greatest possible extent the interests of the taxpayer in respect of how this bank has been downsized.</P>
        <P><b>Deputy Joan Burton</b> How do we know that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the situation.  The question here, as outlined by the chairman today, is that a small number of people have been given additional responsibilities, as a result of the present downsizing of the bank&rsquo;s staff by more than one seventh, in order to do the necessary work to ensure this operation discharges its responsibilities to the taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach tell us what is so important about these people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what is going on.  If the Deputy is asking me whether we are going to have a situation whereby we express no confidence in the new board and management, that would be a recipe for chaos.  I must ensure they get on with the day to day management of the bank.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They have explained there are 70 people in that organisation who are taking on additional responsibilities and they must get on with that operational job.   What we must and will do, and what the Minister for Finance will do, is to come into the Chamber to explain exactly how we will restructure the banking system, including this bank, so that we can have a proper functioning banking system and deal with all the issues that people complain about, such as the provision of sufficient credit in this economy.  That is the job we have to do.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I travelled to Copenhagen on 17 December to participate with more than 120 other Heads of State and Government in the high level segment of the United Nations climate change conference.  The objective of the conference was to seek agreement to put in place a new international treaty on climate change as a successor to the Kyoto Protocol when its five-year commitment period ends in December 2012.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s position on the international climate change agenda is advanced through our membership of the European Union.  We fully supported the European Union&rsquo;s approach to the Copenhagen conference, including being prepared to raise our target for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, from 20% to 30% in the context of an international agreement where developed countries made comparable reduction commitments and there was adequate action by developing countries to curb their emissions growth.</P>
        <P>The eventual outcome of the conference, the Copenhagen Accord, was considerably less ambitious than the one we had hoped for, particularly as it does not include legally binding targets.  However, while the overall outcome was disappointing, the accord none the less contains positive elements on which future progress can be built.  Importantly, the accord includes recognition of the need to limit the increase in global temperatures to 2&deg; Celsius.  It also provides a commitment for significant financial support for climate change mitigation and adaptation in developing countries and the establishment of a mechanism to support action against global deforestation.</P>
        <P>We must reflect and learn from the Copenhagen meeting.  The process is ongoing and the next conference of parties, COP 16, will be held in Mexico at the end of the year.  Chancellor Angela Merkel has already indicated that she will try to bring parties together in Bonn in advance of the Mexico conference to move the discussions forward.</P>
        <P>The European Union, for its part, will honour all its commitments and obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.  It remains committed to emissions reductions of 20% by 2020, rising to 30% in the event of a satisfactory international agreement, and to providing substantial funding to assist developing nations.  We remain a lead player in this respect.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that the outcome was well short of what we hoped for, I commend the Danish Presidency and, in particular, Prime Minister Rasmussen, for their hard work in organising the conference and their considerable efforts in trying to secure a positive outcome to the <Col N="314"/>proceedings.  Ireland will continue to support the European Union in its efforts to persuade all other parties to sign up to an international legally binding deal in Mexico.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that there was no agreement in Copenhagen and that the EU had set emission reduction targets for 2020, what analysis has been carried out by the Government or the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?  Will this outcome impact more severely on the targets Ireland must now achieve by 2020?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point made is that although the European Union considers that the Copenhagen Accord is insufficient and needs to be developed in a more ambitious and robust legal agreement, it accepts that this was the best outcome that could be achieved at the time.  The accord should be seen as a further step forward in the ongoing negotiations towards an effective international agreement.</P>
        <P>With regard to the formal acceptance of the Copenhagen Accord, the EU has maintained its lead position by reiterating its declaration to a 20% reduction, increasing to 30% within an international agreement where other parties make comparable reductions.  That is the point.  At this point we do not have an international agreement to reach the reduction of 30%.  We have been in detailed discussions with the European Commission on an ongoing basis to ensure we ameliorate the impact in certain sectors.  Various discussions have taken place which would recognise Ireland&rsquo;s particular position, especially in regard to agriculture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear that a low carbon economy can be very competitive.  The national climate change strategy was, in reality, a wish list without any real ownership or management concerning how targets would be achieved.  Although we were close to meeting these targets last year this was because of imploding economic circumstances which brought these targets more sharply into focus.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">There is no international agreement and despite the importance of energy security for our State we are a long way behind in wind provision.  We need to increase what we have by 300% to be anywhere near the targets we set ourselves.  If energy security is of such critical importance &mdash; and it is because we import &euro;6 billion worth of fossil fuels every year &mdash; has the Taoiseach looked at the strategy that was adopted under the national climate change strategy?  Has he given instructions to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, or whomsoever else it may concern such as the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources &mdash; I get the names of Departments mixed up as there are so many of them &mdash; to set out our own enhanced strategy irrespective of international agreements in order to move towards energy security which is of such importance for everybody and for every business in the country?  Has the Taoiseach motivated these people to take action?  The grid offers a recipe for much optimism.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Although it is a more specific question for the Minister, I will give a general answer to the Deputy.  We have already reached our 15% target and we have set a further target of producing 40% of our energy from sustainable sources by 2020.  As the Deputy is aware, we are proceeding with interconnection with the UK so that we can access the wider regional energy market.  We have brought about an all-island electricity market and, as a result, consumers have seen improvements in the prices they pay.  As we try to meet the need to develop sustainable energy resources, we are moving to a greater degree of energy security.  It is on target as we speak.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="315"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand that there are literally hundreds of millions of euro backed up in investment potential for alternative energy and for renewable energy.  The central problem is the capacity of the grid to deal with this.  Regardless of who is in government, we will continue to lag behind over the next 20 years if that central issue is not resolved.  I am aware that EirGrid has laid out its programme for the next five or ten years.  Overseas investors who have serious money behind them want to invest in a country that they consider to clearly have the potential for renewable energy.  Although their money is ready to move, there is no capacity for them to get an offer to join the grid for five, six or ten years to come.  That is not the way it should be.  I recommend that the Taoiseach look at the grid, which is the central problem for the entire country.  Despite EirGrid&rsquo;s proposals, the extent of investment waiting to come on stream, with the consequent potential for thousands of jobs, is being seriously delayed if not lost altogether.  I suggest that the Government should really focus on such investment, which holds enormous potential in terms of employment.  As a consequence of it, our infrastructure would improve and the country would become more attractive to internal and national investment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the ESB and other players in the market have considerable capital plans for the improvement of networks.  It is obvious that EirGrid is involved in the regulation of all of that.  I ask everyone in the House to support the provision of such networks.  Unfortunately, we have seen many instances of exaggerated claims being made about health and safety issues.  Such issues are and will continue to be accommodated in all circumstances.  Deputy Kenny needs everyone to support the policy he is enunciating.  That has not always been the consistent view of those behind him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone shares the view that the outcome at Copenhagen was deeply disappointing.  I would like to pursue the Taoiseach a little further on the action being taken by the Government to tackle climate change.  The revised programme for Government contained a number of commitments in this regard.  First, there was a commitment that the Government would introduce a climate change Bill to give a statutory basis to the annual carbon budget.  Can I ask when we will see such legislation?  The Labour Party and the Oireachtas committee have produced their own Bills in this area.  They could be moved if the Government is not in a position to move its own legislation.  Second, the Government made a commitment to take climate change impact assessments into account when all Cabinet decisions are being made.  Can the Taoiseach outline to the House how such assessments are conducted?  When decisions are being made, is a separate climate change impact assessment document presented to and considered by the Cabinet?  Third, a commitment was made that a national climate change adaptation strategy would be adopted.  I would like to know where that is at.  Finally, there was a commitment that Ireland would ratify the Aarhus Convention by March 2010.  When will the convention be ratified?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy wishes to get exact information on these specific policy development issues, it would be better for his questions to be addressed to the responsible Minister concerned.  While I am keen to provide information, I do not have the details in question to hand.  The questions before the House relate to the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit, rather than to specific domestic policy initiatives that may be undertaken by the Government in any particular area.  It would be better to table a direct question to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer in respect of two of the four matters I raised.  I will pursue the ratification of the Aarhus Convention with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  If the Taoiseach can tell me which Minister is responsible for the producing the national climate change adaptation strategy, I will be happy to pursue the matter with him or her.  I <Col N="316"/>do not accept that the Taoiseach is not in a position to answer my questions on the other two issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>What were the questions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>If I asked him about the climate change Bill on the Order of Business, I would be entitled to get an answer.  I am simply asking when the promised climate change Bill will be produced by the Government.  I would expect him to know what stage of preparation the legislation is at.  I would also expect him to know what is happening with climate change impact assessments.  We were told such assessments would be taken into consideration as part of all Cabinet decision-making.  I assume that is happening.  Is the Taoiseach saying that no climate change impact assessments are being done in advance of Government decisions on various matters, such as infrastructural investment and economic affairs?  I am not asking for the detail of particular assessments.  I am simply asking how such assessments are carried out.  If the Taoiseach knows nothing about it, I presume nothing is being done about it, like many other things in the programme for Government, and therefore there are no climate change impact assessments.  It is all very well for the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to go to Copenhagen and give a lot of rhetorical guff about climate change, when they are doing very little about it at home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is an expert in rhetorical guff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Taoiseach answer my questions?  To which Minister should I direct my questions about the national climate change adaptation strategy?  What is happening with the climate change Bill?  Is the Government undertaking any climate change impact assessments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked three questions, rather than two.  I will answer the three of them for him.  His initial requirement was that I should answer two questions.  I will answer three anyway.  The climate change Bill is due during the course of this year.  Questions on legislation are usually asked on the Order of Business, when I have the information to hand.  If Deputy Gilmore wants to table a specific question on the matter, I will get the answer for him.  I cannot predict every question he might want to ask, particularly if it is outside the remit of the questions before the House.  The purpose of Taoiseach&rsquo;s questions is to try to provide accurate information, rather than to speculate.  I like to give it to the Deputy accurately.  He likes accuracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Great.  The Deputy can take up his second question, on climate change adaptation policy, with the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If he sends a letter to the Minister, he can expect to get a reply.  The third matter raised was the question of climate change impact assessments.  It is obvious that not every Government decision is subject to a climate change impact assessment.  Some decisions do not necessitate such assessments.  Climate change impact assessments will be brought forward by the relevant Departments, where relevant, in respect of Government initiatives that come forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Have any such assessments been brought forward to date?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="317"/>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am not asking the Taoiseach to check all the memos.  I am not asking him to state how many assessments have been brought forward.  I am asking him if any assessments at all have been brought forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, climate change impact assessments, like poverty impact assessments, are set out in memos where relevant.</P>

	<P>Does the Taoiseach remember any such assessment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I read at least 25 or 30 Government memos every week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach cannot remember a single climate change impact assessment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.  The Deputy is well aware that he is asking questions which are beyond the remit of the questions before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should not be getting contrary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not.  It is Deputy Gilmore who is into the rhetorical guff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is it not the honest truth that the Copenhagen summit was an absolute disaster?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the participants failed to meet their responsibility to produce a binding agreement that would have tackled climate change effectively?  It is clear they did not do that.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the vague and badly written political declaration is a setback that will hit hardest those countries in the developing world where climate change is of greatest importance?  The threat posed will spell further economic disaster for those countries in particular.  Does the Taoiseach agree that what was needed were ambitious targets in regard to emissions reductions; clear sources for the substantial &mdash; and I emphasise the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; &mdash; new finance that is needed; and clear commitments, measures and procedures on a range of other issues in order to limit the global increase in temperature to less than 2&deg; Celsius?</P>
        <P>Having listened to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s initial response to this group of questions and his replies to previous speakers, I am at a loss to understand what specific initiatives and actions the Government now intends to take to ensure the next summit, scheduled for the end of the year in Mexico, will not be a replication of the disappointments of the Copenhagen summit.  Will he spell out exactly what new, fresh initiatives the Government intends to take, given the experience and knowledge of the failures and fault lines within the entire approach at Copenhagen?  What is the Government doing to ensure that Mexico will be a summit which people can look forward to with a realistic expectation of concrete deliverables?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course there is disappointment that the ambitions of many to deliver an accord at the last summit were not met.  It was clear before we got to Copenhagen that there would not be a consensus on a legally binding accord, but the effort was made to get agreement on broad principles that would be converted into legal text and subsequently ratified.  It became clear, unfortunately, that major global players in this debate were not prepared to come forward with the same types of proportionate steps as those taken by the European Union in the context <Col N="318"/>of the leadership position it has taken on this matter.  In the absence of a global agreement that would incorporate all areas and all countries that are contributing to the problem, unilateral action by the European Union is not feasible.  However, the European Union has taken a leadership position on this matter and is anxious to proceed.  The question of how to deal with the evolving negotiations that may take place in the course of this year in preparation for the next summit, with the hope of securing a better outcome, will be discussed at the spring European Council meeting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach referred to the European Union as taking a lead position.  In regard to the Government&rsquo;s role and responsibility in this matter, is it the case that we are confined in our approach in the context of our membership of the European Union, or has the Government, on behalf of the people of Ireland, engaged with countries in Africa, Asia and South America &mdash; the countries that have and are likely to suffer most by the failures to grapple with climate change?  Will the Taoiseach outline whether we have taken independent initiatives and built on our work within the European Union in engaging with countries across these other continents?  Does the Government intend to do so in the lead-up to Mexico and in the context of further opportunities that may subsequently present?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of the conduct of aspects of our foreign policy, particularly in this area, Ireland&rsquo;s voice in the world is far greater amplified by adopting common positions with European Union partners.  The idea that Ireland can engage in an individual initiative, outside the parameters of the European Union position of seeking to grow a consensus toward an outcome that meets the needs of the situation, is neither realistic nor achievable.  Ireland is working with partners on a common position so that the European Union can speak to other regions in the world with the strength of a collective voice.  That is a far more effective way of pursuing our foreign policy objective of securing a global agreement on climate change than the idea that we would progress beyond the current position of the European Union in terms of our own particular commitments.  That would have adverse economic impacts for us and affect our competitiveness in a way that would not in any event achieve our objectives.  </P>
        <P>We must work with others to achieve those objectives.  The reality is that failure to secure agreement does not rest with Europe; there are other countries elsewhere in the world that are major contributors to carbon emissions and which are not facing up to their responsibilities.  Everybody must do their bit and Europe is prepared to do more &mdash; as we have indicated and are prepared to indicate publicly &mdash; to bring momentum to these negotiations.  What happened at Copenhagen was that the prospect of agreement, unfortunately, fell away in terms of the initial ambition we adopted.  We must build on where we were at in Copenhagen and seek to make a success of Mexico.  In the context of the next series of negotiations, the European Union will adopt its position after the spring Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that if the European Union is to lead on this matter, it should first ensure that its own member states are developing their natural resources to the extent that they can play a major part in reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions?  We do not have to look far to see the failures in this regard.  The Government established an all-party Oireachtas committee but proceed to ignore its recommendations entirely.  As my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, has stated, that committee has already produced two legislative proposals, one on climate change and the other on offshore renewable energy.  Neither report has seen the light of day, yet we hear much from Government about the importance of the committees structure.</P><Col N="319"/>
        <P>Second, we have neither the legislative provisions nor the grid capacity to develop our natural resources, let alone to meet European targets.  It is a disgrace.  We are years behind and will continue to be years behind in the development of ocean energy.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>As chairman of the Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and energy security, will the Taoiseach take an active role on this issue?  Will he talk to the Minister seated beside him, who is responsible for the greatest disaster of all time in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from transport, which are 146% above target?  Will we lead by example or will we simply go on with all this mere talk of our concern about CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and climate change?  We have two Green Party Ministers who are supposed to be responsible in this area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">They do not have the courtesy to engage with the committee and encourage it to proceed further in this area.  Let us cut out all this nonsense that Europe is leading the fight against climate change.  Leadership starts with one&rsquo;s own country.  We must show that we are developing our natural resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and creating the employment opportunities that are needed.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that we are very competitive.  Does he not realise that electricity prices in the State are among the highest in Europe, which seriously damages our competitiveness?  Yet we have natural resources which, if they were developed, would allow us to become net exporters of electricity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not correct that electricity prices here are among the highest in Europe.  As a result of reductions in the course of the last year, electricity prices are now below the European average.  Work is ongoing in this regard in order to improve the competitiveness of Irish industry.  We have made certain changes that sought to ameliorate the problem, particularly for business users, in order to ensure that we keep energy costs down.  We are a small island market.  Despite the emergence of an all-Ireland electricity market, which has brought its own benefits, we intend to pursue interconnection in order to become part of a wider regional market and to secure access to other sources of energy for purchase, which will ensure we have a proper competitive system.  There has been much change and more players entering the marketplace to assist in that.  However, it is not just a question of more players in the smaller market on this island but also securing interconnection to the wider regional market and ensuring that this, in turn, will bring competitive pressures in terms of price and choice to consumers.</P>
        <P>We are making huge investments in public transport in this city.  We have only seen substantial investment in public transport in Ireland in the last ten or 12 years.  There are major transport projects in various stages of preparation, while some of them are already coming on stream.</P><Col N="320"/>
        <P>The Deputy asked about the Government&rsquo;s position on legislative change.  The Minister is dealing with that matter.  I am aware that the committee has done work in this area.  The preparation of legislation is a matter for the relevant Department and must take account of what has been said.  I am not aware of what happened at the most recent meetings between the Minister and the committee, but it is best to work together to get an effective operation.  If an adversarial approach is taken, then it is hard to make progress but I am sure there is much good work being done.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also spoke about climate change and wave energy.  I met the representatives of an American company prominent in that area who told me they were proceeding with further capital investment here.  We hope that much of the work they are doing will result in a successful commercial outcome.  I replied to Deputy Kenny previously on wind energy and the other sustainable energy sources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in having interconnection if there is no grid to carry the power.  We are years behind on this aspect.  Why are we talking about interconnection if we have not got the grid to export energy?  We have no thought of developing harbours to deal with offshore development.  We do not have the basics put in place.  We do not even talk about a road network.  Do people understand that ocean energy cannot be developed without having harbours?</P>

If the Deputy is for the network, then he should be consistent about it.

He suggested that nothing is being done, but I am explaining to him how the Government is trying to promote this investment.  Things are being said and done on the ground that are at variance with the Deputy&rsquo;s strong commitment to get this done as quickly as possible.  Some of these things are being said by people in the Deputy&rsquo;s own party.  I am entitled to make that point, and if people in my party did that, I would ask them their proposals.  They are either for this or against it.  We cannot demand better infrastructure all over the country, and then go to town halls around the country and agree with those who say they have a problem with such developments.  We cannot have it every way.</P>
        <P>There has been an improvement in the stock of trains and engines at CIE.  There was no rail transport investment in this country up until 1996.  In the last 13 or 14 years, hundreds of millions of euro have been invested in public transport.  More is to be invested, but significant infrastructure projects are being completed on time and within budget across this city.  There are other cities in Ireland that would love to get such projects.  To hear a Deputy from Dublin saying nothing is happening with public transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to ask about the question on the Order Paper on the negotiations that are following the Copenhagen summit.  Is the Government opening a dialogue with the developing bloc of countries that went to the summit with specific demands on the additionality of resources over and above that which is committed to development?</P>
        <P>Very little meaningful progress was made on technology transfer.  It is not good enough to say that the European Council will discuss some of the broader issues, as individual member states of the EU are in negotiation with particular parts of the developing and the undeveloped blocs.</P>
        <P>Is it still the position of the Government and the European Council to stay in pursuit of a legally binding agreement?  Will that agreement have mechanisms of implementation that will be the project of the UN?  Alternatively, is there a slide towards a set of bilateral accommodations between blocs and countries that will fall well short of a legally bind agreement?  This would mean that the Mexico conference in December would be as big a failure as the Copenhagen summit.</P><Col N="322"/>
        <P>I accept the view that a strong positive position by the EU will be of great value at the conference in Mexico.  What precise dialogue is being opened with some of the major players who were obstructionist in the Copenhagen process?  China has described itself as part of the developing bloc, and this differs from the undeveloped bloc.  The undeveloped bloc will go to the Mexico conference claiming that they are paying the highest price in terms of loss of life and environmental costs, yet they are getting the least.  They want a clear answer on additionality and technology transfer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that there is a requirement to assist those undeveloped countries to the greatest possible extent, both in terms of additionality and technological transfer.  There has to be a just outcome to this matter.  As the Deputy said, there are small communities, islands and countries in the undeveloped bloc whose very existence is under threat, given all the available scientific evidence.  They have the greatest stake in this but, unfortunately, they also have the weakest voice.  As regards the values we should espouse and articulate, the EU has been and will be to the forefront in ensuring that we get an outcome that will do justice to those who are under the most severe pressure.  I do not think there is any argument about that.</P>
        <P>It is true to say that the stage the negotiations reached did not indicate what the final figure or outward boundary would be in terms of additionality and technological transfer for those countries.  That was because no overall deal emerged.  However, it is a part of the negotiations which I agree is important and needs to be adequately addressed.  In so far as one can, I hope it can also be addressed to the satisfaction of those undeveloped countries whose very existence is under threat, let alone for other more developed countries which have resources and are in a better position to deal with this problem and find ameliorating measures to compensate for any loss of capacity arising from the commitments they undertake.</P>
        <P>As regards the United Nations, we obviously do not want to see bilateral or trilateral arrangements being made by individual blocs.  We want to see an overall global agreement under the aegis of the UN, which best provides guarantees for that.  I was personally disappointed with the arrangements in Copenhagen, which were under the UN aegis.  It undermined the arguments about the centrality of the UN&rsquo;s ambition and involvement if basic logistical issues regarding the organisation of conferences cannot be dealt with competently.  To that extent, one was dealing with a disorganised situation.  I found it hard to believe, given the importance of the issues that were being dealt with, but that is not germane to the debate&rsquo;s issues.  While we have always advocated that the UN must be centrally involved in these issues, it must show the capacity and competence to be the player it needs to be in order to provide a just outcome for those whose voices, thus far, have not been adequately heard in this debate.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>I believe in working towards the UN&rsquo;s common position, which does not mean that this country will abdicate its responsibility for advocacy on these matters.  In addition, it ensures that in our bilateral relations with those affected, we have a good relationship in terms of our UN participation in New York and elsewhere.  Nobody is suggesting that Ireland is less than committed to the issues regarding the group of countries to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has said that the United Nations&rsquo; role and responsibility are clear following any future agreement.  Is it not the case that individual EU countries are effectively trading off different levels of crisis against each other?  These include the food, energy, environmental and climate change crises.  My question is positive towards the outcomes that will happen in Mexico.  If, for example, technology transfer is to be left to individual countries&rsquo; arrangements with countries receiving development aid, one will not be <Col N="323"/>able to monitor the issue of additionality.  In addition, the technology transfer will not be of sufficient volume to enable individual developing countries to participate in the agreement in Mexico.  Does the question mark over some scientific activities &mdash; not the work, but the publications &mdash; mean that the United Nations has moved back from taking the lead role?  I refer to the UN taking responsibility for technology transfer as a global achievement, and for changing the role of its institutions such as the UN Development Programme.  Will this be done in such a way that, effectively, the issues of additionality, accepting differences, survival and the balance between the different crises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>This is my question: is the UN being urged by the Irish Government to resume a more active role in being the lead agency for resolving the issues that will go into the Mexico conference?  Is there any evidence available to the Taoiseach that the UN is resuming such a role?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has raised a fair point.  I will take the matter up with the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure that we are letting the UN know that we want it to be involved in this area.  It is not a question of coming up with a deal that does not have the necessary transparency we would like to see, so that in signing up to something these developing countries would know exactly what they will get, and that it was additional rather than a replacement or less than what is being suggested.  There are detailed aspects to these negotiations, which are dealt with at a technical level and need to be cleared.  I do not have the details with me but I note what the Deputy has said.  I will take the matter up with the Minister and ask him to revert to the Deputy.  </P>

	<P>I ask the Taoiseach whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs will take time today to make a statement to the House about how he intends to manage the disruption being experienced by citizens who wish to obtain passports at the Passport Office.  The Taoiseach is aware that every citizen is constitutionally entitled to a passport and to travel.  Those rights are being denied to citizens at the moment.  Has the Government considered a situation in which it fails to deliver on the constitutional imperative for so many citizens?  If a person who wants to travel abroad with his family books a holiday and pays the airline but cannot travel because he cannot get a passport, there is clearly a case for him to receive compensation from the Government, as he has lost money through no fault of his own.  How does the Government propose to manage the delivery of its constitutional responsibility to provide passports and uphold the right to travel for people who want to leave the country?</P>
        <P>What is the Government&rsquo;s response in cases in which people have clearly followed the procedures and have not had their passports delivered, thus incurring losses from money paid to airlines and so on through no fault of their own?  They followed the procedure but their passports have not been sent.  The Government has failed to deliver on that constitutional imperative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised in this area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no legislation promised.  My great regret in this matter is that the Passport Office has in the past been an excellent example of the provision of a good public service.  An industrial relations issue has arisen and the only way it can be resolved is to see the action stopped.  The impact this is having on the public is absolutely disproportionate to the issues being raised.  A forum has been established on my initiative to ensure all issues like this can be dealt with in current discussions.</P>
        <P>For everybody interested in the public service and in respect to any concerns or aspirations public servants have, ordinary public servants know why the Government had to take the decisions it took in December.  The issue for today and over the coming weeks is to deal with the backlog that has emerged as a result of the action.  The only way the backlog can be resolved is to lift the action of not co-operating with the employment of seasonal staff that could be brought in to deal with the matter and stop the refusal to do overtime, which would normally be available.  There are many seasonal fluctuations in the number of passports being sought at a given time of the year, with Easter and the summer being the busiest times.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask that common sense prevail and people enable temporary staff to be taken on to deal with the backlog to try to get back to a proper service for people who need it.  It concerns people who may not be in a position of life and death but who need this service in the normal course of events.  I acknowledge that in the past we have seen that staff in the Passport Office are good, committed public servants who have provided a good service.  We need to get back <Col N="329"/>to that position and the only way to deal with the matter is to have the union lift the stipulation not to co-operate with seasonal staff, should they be brought in, and allow overtime to be provided.  That is how to get the position back to normal as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>With regard to other matters, there is a forum and facilitation taking place and discussions are ongoing.  Issues can be dealt with like so and cannot be dealt with in any other forum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the union representing staff working in the passport offices has issued protective strike notice.  This issue has been very disruptive for thousands of people and the Government has failed to put in place a system that delivers a service to citizens that they deserve and which is their constitutional right.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has made comments in good faith about getting the working position restored.  May I take it from his comments that he clearly supports the lifting of the embargo now?  Does he support overtime being made available and the introduction of temporary workers normally employed at this time of the year in the passport offices to deal with a backlog?  If so, has the Taoiseach communicated this, through his office, to the union and asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs to speak directly to unions about the Government&rsquo;s wishes?  Is there anything further he can add through making a statement in the House today?</P>
        <P>Every Deputy from every party has heard of hundreds of cases from all over the country.  People have travelled by train but were unable to get into the office.  There are issues concerning management of the line, with people possibly being ordered by who is travelling on Friday, Monday or Tuesday if there is authentic proof of travel.  Given that there is an extensive line of people, there could be simple management of the queue according to who is travelling on a particular day.  That would be much more manageable.</P>
        <P>It is imperative that the Taoiseach ensures the Minister for Foreign Affairs intervenes and expresses the Government&rsquo;s wishes in this regard directly to the union and staff so that the matter can be resolved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an ongoing process in place.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not working.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It began on my invitation and was agreed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Government as employers.  All the unions, including the one which the Deputy has said has suggested protective strike notice, is involved in that process.  Best industrial practice means there cannot be an escalation of disputes when there is an ongoing discussion for the purpose of trying to find a way forward and trying to coincide the public interest with any aspirations public servants have for their future work.  We must get on with that job, which cannot be dealt with in the context of the action taking place.</P>
        <P>It is a matter of particular regret to me that this is occurring in an office which has been, in the past, an excellent example of how the public service provides an important service to the public in a very competent and professional way with a quick turnaround.  We must get back to that position.  Every year temporary staff are always taken on at this time and overtime is provided to deal with the greater workload.  That has always been facilitated and will continue to be facilitated.  It has been sought but there has been a decision not to co-operate with the policy which must be lifted.  The only way to deal with a backlog of 44,000 applications is to see that this happens.</P><Col N="330"/>
        <P>The modification of the union position this morning, moving from issues of life and limb to trying to provide the service to everyone who needs it, will not be possible without extra temporary staff and overtime.  We must get on with the business and there is another forum being facilitated by people who are expert in industrial relations in order to deal with general issues.  That should be allowed and we cannot have an escalation when there is a facilitation of discussions agreed between congress and the Government as employer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand why this industrial action is taking place; it is a result of anger among low-paid public servants in particular that the Government unilaterally cut pay and threw their trade unions out of Government Buildings last December.  When issues of pay and people&rsquo;s employment conditions and contracts are approached in such a way, there is a consequence.</P>
        <P>I have called for a suspension of the industrial action given the major inconvenience being caused to the public and the difficulties being posed for people.  I was glad to see yesterday a statement and decision from the union concerned that it was prepared to vary the industrial action.  I was surprised at the reaction of the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, which effectively shot down the suggestion.  An opportunity was provided yesterday evening when the trade union concerned indicated a willingness to vary the industrial action and the appropriate Minister should have taken it positively, sat down with union representatives and tried to work out some kind of formula that would have got over the crisis that now exists in the passport offices.  It clearly did not happen and there is now a position where there is talk of escalating the dispute.  The Government&rsquo;s handling of the issue leaves much to be desired.</P>
        <P>There are a couple of other issues I wanted to raise with the Taoiseach.  This morning he announced the assignment of Ministers to a number of Departments, referring to the Departments as they were before yesterday.  In his introduction of the motion yesterday, he said it was intended to reconfigure Departments and rename a number of them.  Is it intended to bring legislation before the House to provide for the reconfiguration of the Departments and, if so, when will that be introduced?</P>
        <P>When is the reconfiguration of the Departments to take place?  For example, we were told yesterday that matters relating to science investment and research were to be transferred from the Department of Education and Science to the new Department responsible for enterprise, trade and innovation.  If Deputies have a question relating to science or research, to which Department or Minister do we address the question?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I also wish to inquire about matters relating to cost.  When the Department of Social Welfare became the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in 1997, it cost &pound;2 million to change the logos on its headed paper and on nameplates outside its offices.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach announced changes in name for five Departments.  There is probably a consequential change in the name of a sixth Department given that if responsibility for equality is to be transferred to the new Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, then I presume the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will become the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  If it cost &pound;2 million to change the name of one Department in 1997, how many millions of euro will it cost to change the names of six Departments in 2010?</P>
        <P>The Ceann Comhairle indicated that he received the resignation of former Deputy Martin Cullen.  Although I took issue with the former Deputy in respect of certain matters in the past, I take this opportunity to wish him well.  This latest resignation means that there are now three <Col N="331"/>vacancies in the House.  When it is intended to hold by-elections in respect of those vacancies?  It is normally the case that when a vacancy arises as a result of the death of a Member, a suitable period is allowed to pass before the by-election is held.  However, the three current vacancies came about as a result of resignations as opposed to the deaths of Members.  As a result, there is no need to postpone holding the by-elections.  When will those by-elections be held?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The third matter I wish to raise with the Taoiseach is the lost at sea scheme report.  I have been putting moderate questions to the Taoiseach on this matter, which I believe should be dealt with in a non-partisan manner.  I suggested that it should be referred to an Oireachtas committee in order that the issues raised by the Ombudsman might be dealt with.  It is clear that the Ombudsman is unhappy with regard to the way in which this matter has been handled.  In an interview in last Saturday&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, stated that the future of her office is at stake as a result of the way in which this matter has been dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, this is the Order of Business and I am seeking to discover whether the Taoiseach &mdash; in the absence of further unnecessary rancour &mdash; will agree to have this matter referred to an Oireachtas committee in order that it might be dealt with.  If this does not happen, those of us who are members of Opposition parties will be obliged to take the appropriate steps in order to exercise our responsibility in the matter on the floor of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not know what the Deputy means by his final comment.  The basic point is that the Ombudsman presented a special report on the lost at sea scheme to the Houses of the Oireachtas, at which time she invited them to &ldquo;consider my report and ... take whatever action they deem appropriate&rdquo;.  That has happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not happened.  That is the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Both Houses have discussed the report.  I have no difficulty with the relevant committee dealing with any of these matters.  I am not involved in any phoney confrontation with anyone.  As I have done in the past, however, I am entitled to make the point that there is no obligation on the Government to accept the recommendations in a special report.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the record of the debates relating to this matter that there has been an attempt to continue with a misrepresentation of the position of a certain Member of the House.  The particular allegations in this case &mdash; which the Ombudsman, in her report, accepts were not well grounded &mdash; continue to be made.  Deputy Gilmore suggests that he wants this matter dealt with in a non-partisan fashion.  However, in the debates that have taken place it has been dealt with in an extremely partisan way.  That is the truth of the matter.</P>
        <P>If people want to deal with the report in a proper fashion before a committee of the Houses, I for one am not in the business of blocking what committees want to do.  I am also not in the business of facilitating those who state that they want a matter to be dealt with in a non-partisan way when the contents of the relevant debates on that matter suggest the contrary.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman&rsquo;s report sets out the position.  The charges that were made against the relevant Deputy were unfounded.  However, for political reasons, Members of this House are making efforts to ensure that the matter remains in the public domain and it is they who keep uttering jibes, etc.</P>

I am not involved in a confrontation with the Ombudsman and nor have I any interest in becoming so involved.  I am concerned with regard to the way people have sought to use the report in the House in order to continue to make allegations which are without foundation.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>

	<P>I have just outlined the position.  Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s problem is that he does not listen.  He has a major problem in that regard.  He has a great deal to say but he does not listen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>

	<P>I am not involved in a confrontation with anybody.

      </Speaker><Col N="333"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore also inquired about the renaming, etc., of various Departments.  A transfer of function order will have to be drawn up in respect of the various changes that were announced.  That will be done in due course and in the normal way.  The programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, will be transferred to the new Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  The changes and rearrangements I announced yesterday are intended to provide better services to the public.  On organisational changes, realignments will have to be made.  In the first instance, there must be better co-ordination among existing organisations and the Departments.  The purpose of the rearrangements is to ensure that the outcomes will be better for the people who need to access the services to which I refer.  The various issues that arise will be dealt with over time.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also inquired about costs.  I made various changes to certain Departments and I sought to indicate the new emphasis that will be brought to bear by the relevant Department in respect of, for example, innovation.  The latter is at the heart of an industrial policy that will drive the investment strategies of businesses that will be contacted by IDA Ireland and which will work with Enterprise Ireland.  That is the purpose of what I have done.  This is not the first occasion on which name changes have occurred.  Whatever consequential changes arise, must be dealt with sensibly and in the normal way.  There is nothing to disbar a Taoiseach or Government of the day from making new arrangements or ensuring that the names of Departments indicate what are the activities of those Departments.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s first question related to by-elections.  A decision has not yet been taken in respect of the holding of by-elections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Given that the Taoiseach has no objection to the lost at sea report being referred to an Oireachtas committee, will he accept the motion on the Order Paper in that regard which is tabled in the name of Deputy Sherlock?  The issue now at stake here is as much about the Office of the Ombudsman as it is about the report.  The dissatisfaction with the way the report was dealt with was expressed by the Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>The second point I wish to raise relates to the reconfiguration of Departments.  When will the transfer of functions order be introduced?  Confusion has already arisen in respect of the changes that have been made.  For example, the questions on today&rsquo;s Question Paper are addressed to the Ministers for Education and Skills, Justice and Law Reform and Social Protection.  Everybody seems to be confused now as to who is Minister for what and what are the Departments.  Will the Taoiseach clear up this?  From when will the reconfigured Departments take effect?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Deputy Gilmore has experience of the House.  He has known formation of Governments in the past, even ones of which he was half part.  The transfer of function orders will be drawn up in due course, confirmed at Cabinet and put before the Houses of the Oireachtas or laid in the Library or wherever they are brought.  In the meantime I want to see the practical arrangements put in place.  We want to see better service provided in the training and skills area, where F&Aacute;S will liaise with what is being done in education.  In the meantime corporate accountability remains with the existing Departments until the new arrangements are put in place.  On a practical level we will get on with ensuring that the agency sits down with the Ministers concerned and that the practical arrangements for the interface between that wing of F&Aacute;S dealing with social welfare and the other wing of F&Aacute;S dealing with education will proceed and make the necessary arrangements to improve co-ordination in the first instance and work through the ultimate integration at a stage in the future which may require legislation.  That does not stop the immediate point which is to get a better service for those who need it by ensuring that the various parts of the organisation deal properly with the new Department.  The political decision has been made and we will now deal with it.  There is no <Col N="334"/>confusion.  The existing arrangements remain in place while that process begins and once the transfer of functions orders are decided they will move to the other Departments.</P>

It is a matter for the House to decide, whatever views people outside the House may have on it.  We had a debate on it in plenary session.  There is now a request that we deal with it in committee.

Its statement of strategy states that it will conform with the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act until the statutory instrument is signed.

	<P>Deputy Tuffy, on promised legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>This pertains to secondary legislation.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Curran, has been promoted to the position of Chief Whip and I congratulate him.  My question relates to a matter in his new area of responsibility.  The previous Chief Whip, Deputy Pat Carey, recently spoke to the Joint Committee on the Constitution about proposals to amend the Standing Orders of this House in respect of how business operates to give Deputies a more enhanced role.  It is in the interest of both the Government and the Opposition to do something about this issue because it is in no one&rsquo;s interest when our Parliament is knocked, as has happened recently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We would welcome positive thoughts on the matter, particularly in respect of the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>This relates to the Order of Business because it pertains to Standing Orders.  In the United Kingdom, the Government and Opposition have worked together and have come up with proposals to enhance the role of MPs there.  Is something similar proposed here?  For example, one could move the Adjournment debate to the morning and make it the commencement business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Curran, is settling into his brief.  I am sure he will be able to discuss this matter further with his constituency colleague, Deputy Tuffy, in the coming weeks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, this pertains to promised legislation.  Arising from the controversy that surrounded the enactment of the Defamation Act and the inclusion of blasphemy, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform has since made an announcement to the effect that he intends to hold a referendum to excise the provision from the Constitution.  The Taoiseach should indicate when it is intended to hold a referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice and Law Reform has recently made public his intention to propose to the Government an amendment to the Constitution to delete the provision concerning blasphemous libel.  The proposal would avail of the opportunity afforded by other planned referendums.  He indicated this approach during the consideration by the Oireachtas of the Defamation Bill.  It will be considered in the context of whether and when other referendums will be held.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Taoiseach.  May I take it, given the all-party agreement on the proposed amendment regarding the rights of children, that it will be held in conjunction with that proposal this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>What is the up-to-date position in respect of those thousands of bog owners?  The turf machines are trundling their way down the bog roads of Ireland and are about to cut.  Are they allowed to so do?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is no promised business in this regard.  The Deputy is aware that a ten-year derogation was obtained in respect of the traditional rights of turf cutters on protected bogs.  The then Minister, S&iacute;le de Valera, obtained that derogation, the length of which was unique in the context of the aforementioned directive.  This is how matters stand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is actually stating that the cutters are banned from this day on.  This is absolutely shameful.</P>

	<P>This also affects the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach will be busy between walking the dog and footing the turf.  I wish to raise two items of secondary legislation with the Taoiseach.  The first is a legislative item I raised with the Taoiseach in the Chamber a fortnight ago, that is, the introduction of a new statutory instrument in respect of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to remove the exemption from the requirement of planning permission for head shops.  When will this item of secondary legislation be introduced?  Second, the Government has drafted a statutory instrument under the Misuse of Drugs Act to ban quite a number of products that are on sale in head shops.  The Taoiseach has informed the House that it will take three months for approval from the European Commission.  In light of the fact that the three-month period has expired in the United Kingdom for the banning of similar substances that are to be banned here and in light of the European Commission&rsquo;s ability to give approval for the immediate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We will try to find out about the basic query the Deputy has on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;ban of mephedrone on public health grounds and given that another young girl died yesterday in the United Kingdom following the consumption of mephedrone, will the Taoiseach make this a priority?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is secondary legislation promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government introduce a statutory instrument to ban mephedrone and the other products immediately?  When will Members have sight of the secondary legislation of the Planning and Development Act?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Reilly, on the same matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the same matter and another unrelated matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please do not.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="342"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>On this matter, I asked both that this secondary legislation be put in place and that the Minister for Health and Children introduce secondary legislation to ensure first that there would be product liability on all the products sold and second that the Irish Medicines Board and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland would be obliged to pass all substances for sale in such shops.  This would have the net effect of shutting them down.</P>
        <P>While I am on my feet, I will raise an unrelated matter.  The Taoiseach might confirm to Members that there is a recruitment committee responsible for appointing senior management to NAMA and that one person on that committee is a Mr. Maurice Keane.  Is this the case because this man is a director&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must find another way to raise the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not stop now.  This is the Anglo Irish Bank&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but there are other ways of so doing.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but the point is the question is out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Mr. Maurice Keane, who is a director of Anglo Irish Bank, also on a committee to select management for NAMA, to which his bank will be selling bonds and loans?  Is this not a gross conflict of interest?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should table a question to the line Minister.  I call Deputy Durkan.</P>

	<P>I am entitled to a response in respect of the secondary legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same matter, I refer to the legislation in preparation to ban certain products in head shops.  On foot of the transfer in ministerial responsibility from, I understand, the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, to the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, will this legislation continue in train?  Will the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, deliver the legislation?</P>
        <P>In the context of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s trip to Brussels tomorrow and Friday, the only item on the summit&rsquo;s agenda is the financial future of Greece.  The Chancellor&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is seeking detailed information.  Hopefully, he will get it via a parliamentary question.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>

	<P>If the Government can ban substances like St. John&rsquo;s Wort because of powerful lobbies, surely it can proscribe the substances in head shops.  People in Ireland must travel across the Border into the United Kingdom to get a simple substance, St. John&rsquo;s Wort, because it was banned due to the influence of major people.</P>

	<P>On promised legislation, it has long been recognised that there is an urgent need to amend the Mental Health Act 2001.  Amnesty International has published a good dissertation on the human rights implications of that Act.  When will the mental health (amendment) Bill, which will deal with this issue, be introduced in the D&aacute;il?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Further to the Government&rsquo;s proposal on the reconfiguration of Departments, is legislation to break up F&Aacute;S into three parts proposed?  If this is not the intention, which Minister will be answerable to the D&aacute;il for F&Aacute;S?  In terms of the examination of F&Aacute;S by the Committee of Public Accounts, which Secretary General will be the responsible Accounting Officer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As things stand, it will remain with the existing Department until, as I have said, a transfer of functions order is signed and dealt with.  In the first instance and as of today, we need to sit down with the F&Aacute;S operation.  Two thirds of its operations deal with placements <Col N="345"/>and all of that area will be dealt with in the Department of Social Protection to get people working together to provide a better service for the people who need it.  Similarly, skills policy will be dealt with in the Department of Education and Skills.  The corporate accountability issues remain with the main Department until such time as there is legislation that will change it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked about the final situation, that is, what the setup of F&Aacute;S will be.  Our first job is to align and co-ordinate the work being done and deal with issues of how to proceed.  In due course, whatever legislation is needed to effect a Government decision will be effected.  In the meantime, corporate accountability for the organisation will remain with the current Department until the changes take place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government dealt with decentralisation in secret.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>What one does is indicate which parts of the operation will deal with which Departments.  One gets them to sit down and co-ordinate their works so as that people who need their service get a better service than the current one.  Over time and as one deals with the IR issues, one makes whatever arrangements are necessary in terms of the organisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a basic thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the meantime, one makes sure that the service is better for the people who need it.  We are one of the few countries in the world that do not have a placement service in line with those who receive the benefits.  That is what we must get on with.  That is what the OECD report states.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but we expected that the Government would have worked it out and would know at this stage whether legislation would be necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be the outcome of this.</P>

	<P>Will there be legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I am sorry for saying this on the Order of Business, but the important point is that we must get this part of that organisation to work with the services provided by social welfare to improve the choice for people in that area.  Similarly, the skills training part will deal with the Department of Education and Skills.  I outlined in a statement to the House yesterday the purpose of this and how we will proceed with it.  This must be arranged, co-ordinated and then proceeded with.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the first case, and as I said to Deputy Gilmore, a transfer of functions order must be made.  There will then be co-ordination between what is happening in that part of the F&Aacute;S organisation and social welfare.  Over time as we deal with the IR issues, we will deal with the overall integration of the service.  That is what is going to happen.  Whatever is required legislatively to achieve that will be proceeded with.  End of story.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Two days ago, the Minister for Transport said the coast guard had issued the recommendation.  We met with the coast guard a couple of days ago and it told us it did not issue the recommendation but that it had been issued by the Department of Transport.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>With regard to the reconfiguration of ministerial responsibilities, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has had responsibility for community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs.  Deputy Pat Carey&rsquo;s brief does not include rural affairs.  There is genuine concern among people involved in rural affairs.  I have received calls on this and I ask the Taoiseach to clarify the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me clarify this matter for Deputy Deenihan.  I know he has a genuine interest in this area.  The rural social scheme goes across to the new Department of Social <Col N="350"/>Protection but responsibility for voluntary community and rural affairs remains in what is now Deputy Pat Carey&rsquo;s Department.  The rural social scheme has gone with other community employment schemes and they will all be dealt with by one Department.  At present they are spread among three Departments.</P>

	<P>I am afraid I must mention the dogs again.  The horse and greyhound industry has been bounced back into the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food but it is not clear how funding for the horse and greyhound fund will be put in place.

      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Dermot Ahern told Deputy Joe Costello, &ldquo;The Deputy can expect the publication of legislative proposals in the normal course&rdquo;.  That was said in relation to gambling.  I raise the issue of Internet gambling and a tax take from it.  When can we expect some progress to ensure that the horse and greyhound industries are supported and made viable in the future?</P>

	<P>I am happy to bring George Mitchell Scholarship Fund (Amendment) Bill 2010 back before the D&aacute;il.  All stages of the Bill were taken in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on Thursday, 18 February and in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on Tuesday, 23 February 2010.  I am now seeking the agreement of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to one amendment made in the Seanad to section 3 of the Bill.  </P>
        <P>Section 3 amends subsection 2(3) of the 1998 Act, which comprises a number of general provisions relating to the establishment, scope and management of the George Mitchell scholarship fund, with particular reference to the accounts of the fund.  The Seanad amendment ensures that accountability arrangements for the annual audit of the fund are further strengthened.  The amendment ensures that the auditor, which the fund manager is obliged to appoint each year, is appointed with the consent of the Minister.</P>
        <P>The George Mitchell scholarship fund is held, controlled and managed in the United States by a fund manager, currently the US-Ireland Alliance, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills.  Under the existing agreement the fund manager is required to provide the Minister with a copy of the audited accounts of the fund on an annual basis.  During the debate on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il it was suggested that consideration should be given to having the Minister actually appoint the auditor each year.  I explained then that given that the fund is managed in the United States it is considered more appropriate that a US based audit firm conduct the annual audit of the fund.  The present arrangement, whereby the fund manager appoints the auditor, has operated since 1999.  Copies of the audited accounts are also conveyed each year to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General before being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is also considered more practical for the fund manager to select the firm to conduct the annual audit in the ordinary course of events.</P>
        <P>Under both the existing and draft new agreement the Minister can request, and the fund manager must permit, additional independent auditors to examine the records relating to all <Col N="353"/>matters of the agreement.  Having considered this issue in some detail, however, I am satisfied that having the fund manager appoint the auditor each year with the consent of the Minister makes for an improved arrangement and on that basis I brought forward this ministerial amendment.</P>
        <P>I add that my Department is also arranging for the draft new agreement with the alliance to be amended to reflect this provision once the amending legislation has been passed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming back to the House on this matter and for taking the unusual step of accepting an amendment in principle from this House and formally proposing it in the Seanad with the clear knowledge that he would have to bring the Bill back to this House and thereby lose a certain amount of operational time.  I appreciate that.</P>
        <P>I will briefly explain the reason we tabled this amendment.  Some concerns were expressed about the operation of this fund and some ill-informed comments were made which have been distractionary.  In view of the variable standard of accountancy practices worldwide, it is not necessary for the Minister to be in the driving seat in terms of the nomination or identification of either an accountancy firm or a manager but it is necessary for the Minister to have some oversight or final say and to be satisfied on behalf of taxpayers that the selection was appropriate and those concerned are professionally competent to do the work involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Suggestions were made to the effect that this fund represents a great deal of Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money being allocated at a time when there are cutbacks and constraints in other areas of expenditure in education, but Deputy Brian Hayes and I have held to account in that regard the Minister of State and the Minister.  In the ill-informed commentary against this project an understanding of what an endowment fund actually is has been obscured.  An endowment fund is a once-off lump sum of capital allocated for a particular purpose, surrounded by proper trustees, fiduciary requirements and safeguards, and the income derived from that once-off fund would go towards the funding of the scholarships.  In other words, it is not the case the &euro;20 million in the fund will be disbursed over a period of time and once it is all allocated the trustees will come back and seek more money.  Such a fund is a fairly standard procedure in many educational institutions.  There are chairs endowed in Trinity and UCD.  A once-off capital sum is set aside and made available and the income derived from that fund is deemed to be adequate to fund the exercise, in this case to provide for approximately 12 students under the George Mitchell scholarship fund.</P>
        <P>I want to repeat a point, as I want to put it on record in view of what has been said by way of ill-informed comment elsewhere.  Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews accord and the other agreements, Hillsborough being the final one, we have finally reached a stage in our relationship with the other island and the Unionist community in Northern Ireland, it having been bedevilled for centuries.  That bedevilled relationship found its way across the Atlantic and was reflected in the activities of many Irish Americans in trying to help their former homeland to come to an accommodation as to how we share these islands together.  This has been successfully achieved.  It is, to borrow a phrase from the Italian Communist Party, a classic historical compromise.  We now need to reach out to a much wider American community who have no Irish connections, no Irish antecedents and no reason to be aware of what Ireland, and Britain for that matter, have achieved or not achieved in the past.  The option presented to Americans to study here in some of the best universities in Europe, as international rated agencies have testified, will give us in Ireland an opportunity to reach out to new cohorts of Americans who have no knowledge, experience or familial ties <Col N="354"/>with this country.  Hopefully their experience of studying in top class universities here will open up new opportunities to achieve the kind of knowledge-based economy and international collaboration which is one of the objectives of the Government and one of the specific responsibilities for which the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, has direct responsibility.  I thank him for accepting the amendment and for bringing it back to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Quinn on proposing this amendment in the House and the Government, through the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, for accepting it and tabling an amendment in the Seanad.  It significantly strengthens the Bill for the Minister of the day to have such oversight in working with the alliance to ensure there is clarity on the question of accountancy practices and the usefulness of the funds that are in place.  The inclusion of this amendment is a significant improvement.  I congratulate Deputy Quinn and the Minister of State on amending the Bill in this bipartisan way.</P>
        <P>I wish to make two comments.  We have a tremendous opportunity to tap into the potential of international education and to create in this country a destination for many international students who want to come and study here.  Last week I produced a paper on behalf of my party which highlights the potential over a five-year period &mdash; similar to what has been done in New Zealand and in Britain &mdash; whereby we could virtually double the number of students coming to this country and double the yield in that respect.  At present the yield accruing is &euro;900 million made up of &euro;500 million on the English language side and &euro;400 million in higher education.  There is no reason we could not achieve that over a five-year period.  The potential for extra jobs is enormous.</P>
        <P>We have a tremendous location.  We are an English speaking country in Europe and ours is a safe community.  We have diaspora not only in the United State but throughout the world, as Deputy Quinn said, comprising second generation Irish people in the United States in particular.  We need to market our country.</P>
        <P>This fund is good for our country, for employment and for universities.  I spoke to the president of UCC some time ago and that university is ahead of the game here.  Some 10% of its total student cohort is made up of international students.  The main benefit to be gained from such a measure for a  university is not only monetary but that of the participation in tutorials of international students alongside our students and they being part of the same examination process and upping standards for our students.  With the George Mitchell scholarship fund, which emanated from the Northern Ireland peace talks, we have managed to put in place a scholarship programme for American students.  We need to consider if we could put in place a scholarship programme for the Asian, Chinese or the Indian markets, which would result in our having ambassadors who would come to this country, obtain opportunities through higher education and then return home and sell Ireland indirectly in their home countries.</P>

        <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department which sent me, on foot of my request on Committee Stage, a detailed breakdown of the number of scholars under the George Mitchell scholarship fund initiative in each year since 2001 and it showed the variety of colleges, North and South, in which they studied.  It is important that scholars be allowed to study in prog<Col N="355"/>rammes in the institutes of technology in the next few years.  While Trinity, UCD, UL, DCU, the Queen&rsquo;s University, Belfast, are the typical traditional colleges, we have an opportunity to market many of our excellent institutes of technology during the next few years.  That would be good for them and good for the scholars.</P>

I would be interested in considering the Fine Gael proposals in that regard.  I thank Deputies again for their co-operation.

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 7, line 48, after &ldquo;system&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for both employees and the general public&rdquo;.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0" el="5">I acknowledge that the Minister of State has accepted a significant number of the amendments Deputies proposed on Committee Stage.  The purpose of this amendment is to improve the definition of the term &ldquo;safety case&rdquo; and ensure it achieves more than currently proposed.  Under the current wording, the term &ldquo;safety case&rdquo; means &ldquo;a document describing the components of the safety management system relating to the designated petroleum activity concerned&rdquo;.  The amendment proposes to add, after the words &ldquo;safety management system&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;for both employees and the general public&rdquo;.  As I noted on Committee Stage, the definition of the term &ldquo;safety case&rdquo; must be watertight to ensure a petroleum activity or project that involves the laying of pipelines or bringing ashore of gas or oil is safe for the employees working on the infrastructure and members of the public.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage, some confusion arose as to whether my reference to a safety case related to workplace safety, which is the responsibility of the Health and Safety Authority.  This is not the purpose of the amendment, which is to ensure that if, for example, a gas pipeline is being constructed, all the safety measures should be outlined in the safety case being made when the relevant company applies for a permit to proceed with the project.  This would ensure those working on the pipeline or members of the public living nearby would be catered for as <Col N="356"/>regards the safety case.  While I do not intend to cause a fundamental division on this issue, I believe the proposed wording improves the definition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Coveney and McManus for their wise contributions on Committee Stage.  I indicated on Committee Stage that the Health and Safety Authority has responsibility for occupational safety and requires in-depth reporting in the context of demonstrating <i>inter alia</i> that a major accident prevention policy and safety management system for implementing it have been put into effect and that major accident hazards have been identified and the necessary measures taken to prevent such accidents and limit their consequences for people and the environment. </P>
        <P>The health and safety interests of employees are regulated by the Health and Safety Authority.  Any reference in this Bill to a requirement that a petroleum safety case should address the interests of employees would cause regulatory ambiguity and lead to confusion between the Health and Safety Authority and the Commission for Energy Regulation in trying to discharge their respective statutory obligations.  For this reason, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  Having pursued this matter in a non-partisan manner, I am certain the Deputy will understand my position.  I genuinely believe the suggestions made by Opposition Members on Committee Stage were very helpful in improving the Bill.</P>

Amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 24 are related to amendment No. 2 while amendment No. 18 is consequential on amendment No. 16.  Amendments Nos. 2, 16, 17, 18 and 24 may be discussed together. </P>
 </Speaker>
        <P>Bill recommitted in respect of amendments No. 2 and 3.</P>
     
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 8, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;&lsquo;safety framework&rsquo; means the risk-based petroleum safety framework established under section 13I;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As amendments Nos. 2, 16, 18 and 24 were not referred to on Committee Stage, they will be recommitted.  I propose to discuss the amendments together with amendment No. 17.  The core objective of these amendments and a number of further amendments which I also propose to recommit is to provide the maximum level of clarity to everyone with an interest in the development of the new safety regulatory framework.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a national risk assessment safety framework based on international best practice, as recommended by Advantica following its safety review of the Corrib gas pipeline.  A risk assessment framework is a regulatory mechanism that will require petroleum undertakings to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission for Energy Regulation that they have reduced and are managing safety risk to a level that is as low as is reasonably practicable.  Having reflected on this core purpose, together with the consultation methodology underpinning the establishment of the new safety system, and having reflected on the contributions of Deputies during the Committee Stage debate, I am proposing a number of amendments that will further clarify the language used in the legislation to ensure clarity for all parties interested in the formulation of a new safety framework.</P><Col N="357"/>
        <P Just="Left">I consider it necessary in amendments Nos. 2 and 16 to reference explicitly risk assessment both in the definition of a petroleum safety framework and in reference to that framework in the body of the Bill in section 131.  Amendment No. 18 is also being proposed in the interest of clarity in that it sets out in a more comprehensible manner the specific bodies to be consulted by the commission in establishing the petroleum safety framework.</P>
        <P>With regard to the timeframe for the implementation of the safety framework, Deputy McManus proposes that this new system should be both established and implemented within six months.  While it is my intention that the new system is implemented at the earliest possible opportunity, given the range and depth of consultation necessary to ensure we introduce the most robust and effective system, I do not believe this is achievable in the timeframe suggested by the Deputy.  For this reason, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
        <P>To ensure the petroleum safety framework is introduced without undue delay, however, I am proposing to reduce the timeframe by which the Minister may give a direction to the commission with respect to the publication of the safety framework.  Amendment No. 24 now proposes that where the safety framework has not been published within six months of the commencement of the safety framework provision, the Minister may direct the commission in writing to publish it not later than the date specified in the ministerial direction.  I am, therefore, leaning towards Deputy McManus&rsquo;s proposal for a six month timeframe rather than the original eight month timeframe.  I have moved halfway towards the Deputy&rsquo;s position, while reserving the right to give a direction as opposed to imposing an absolute time limit of six months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s amendments and I am willing to withdraw my amendment No. 17.  It is noteworthy that the Minister is introducing, in amendment No. 19, a provision which allows for public consultation on a draft of the proposed safety framework where an invitation is made by the commission &ldquo;by means of a notice to that effect published in a newspaper circulating within the State and published in the prescribed manner&rdquo;.  This is a welcome change.</P>
        <P>Following our discussion of this issue on Committee Stage, I commend the Minister on taking an open approach to the legislative process.  I also welcome his decision to incorporate the timeframe, at least in part.  On reflection, I accept that issues arise which require time to address.  It is not my intention to set unreasonable time limits.  The approach taken by the Minister is fine and I am happy to withdraw my amendment.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment was not mentioned on Committee Stage and, therefore, it is being recommitted.  On Committee Stage I introduced amendments aimed at removing any ambiguity from the transitional nature of what is termed an &ldquo;established petroleum activity&rdquo;.  An established petroleum activity is one that is being carried on by an undertaking at the time this Bill becomes law.  The purpose of this amendment is to introduce further clarity to the scope and intentions of the Bill.  I imagine it does not pose any major issue for the Opposition but that is a matter for the Deputies concerned.</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;through a formal public consultation process with a fixed timeframe&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This is the nub of the issue for me.  If we are serious about learning from mistakes made during the fiasco of trying to bring ashore gas from a very significant gas find in County Mayo, a situation where almost everybody to date has been a loser, we must ensure, from the very outset of a process, that there is public consultation.  We must ensure we do not merely say, as the wording of the legislation stands at present, that we will give interested persons, organisations and other bodies an opportunity to make representations but also that we will be proactive in informing and consulting people and listening to what they have to say.  That is the basis of my amendment.</P>
        <P>I recognise the Minister of State has introduced his own amendment to a later section of the Bill, on page 14.  I shall wait to hear what he has to say before withdrawing my amendment.  However, I am very serious when I say to him that we must ensure we push information at people.  Otherwise, conspiracy theories develop which lead to all sorts of problems.  Communities dig in their heels and find very imaginative ways of preventing legitimate projects from moving ahead.  We must ensure that the mistakes which were made by many people in the Corrib situation, including the company and policy makers, do not happen again.  This is for the benefit of communities as well as for the country and will bring energy security benefits to consumers by bringing oil and gas ashore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to consider amendments Nos. 4 and 19 to 23, inclusive, together.  Their common feature is a desire to achieve an appropriate level of public consultation.  Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s amendment seeks to add a formal public consultation process to the designation of petroleum activities.  Having listened to the views expressed by Deputies Coveney and McManus on Committee Stage, I now propose to amend the Bill explicitly to require a formal public consultation process to be carried out by the commission in establishing the safety framework.  As this framework will set out the designated activities, it will afford the public an opportunity to comment on such activities prior to the implementation of the framework. </P>
        <P>I do not propose to accept Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s amendment in respect of a formal public consultation process specific to the designation of petroleum activities.  However, I point out that under section 13<i>(D)</i>(3)<i>(a)</i>(ii) of the Bill the commission is required to &ldquo;give interested persons, organisations and bodies an opportunity to make representations to it&rdquo; in respect of the proposed designation of petroleum activities.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 20 to 23, inclusive, are technical drafting amendments requiring the renumbering of ensuing provisions consequential on the insertion of the new public consul<Col N="359"/>tation provision.  I hope the level of formal consultation on the framework will assuage the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns regarding the information issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem here is that when there is a consultation process during the construction of the framework &mdash; in other words, when we make general rules concerning safety issues, the putting together of safety cases and getting safety permits from the CER &mdash; the chances of communities participating in that process are nil, unless they know the project will affect their area.  If we had decided ten years ago to have a public consultation process regarding safety framework issues for national policy on petroleum activity, nobody from County Mayo would have made any contribution.  They would have been getting on with their normal lives, whether farming or whatever.  It is only when a project threatens a community locally, where a pipeline is to go through its land or its neighbours&rsquo; land, or when a terminal is being built in an area about which the community has concerns, that people engage.</P>
        <P>That is the difference between what I propose and what the Minister proposes.  He proposes that we have a public consultation process which will be high level and will not involve local people.  People will not focus on it unless their local environment or community is threatened.  We are talking about specific projects which are not very common; they are not a-dime-a-dozen.  There are very few specific projects of this kind likely to occur in Ireland.  One could count them on one hand.  Regarding the specifics of a project, the proposal is that it is up to people or organisations to make representations to the CER as opposed to there being a formal information and consultation process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe we are making a mistake here.  I recognise the Minister has come some of the way and that he said it is normal practice in most parts of the world not to have consultation processes.  However, Ireland is not the same as other parts of the world.  We have specific problems in this country in terms of acceptance of the kind of project we are trying to build in County Mayo.  I realise the Minister&rsquo;s concern is that if we open up a public consultation process for every individual project, we will go on for ever.  I agree with that concern.  That is why we should put a timeframe in place.  The problem is that we are going on for ever in any event because local communities, not having been involved at an early stage, develop a resistance to projects.  This resistance is sometimes valid, sometimes not, but in my view it could be dealt with by having an earlier public consultation process.  Otherwise what will happen is what is happening now.  We are still putting public consultation processes in place in County Mayo.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, still goes down to set up forums and discussions and all the other things that had to be done to try to address people&rsquo;s concerns.  That is why I believe the Minister of State is making a mistake on this.</P>
        <P>I recognise I come from the minority side of the House so it will be hard to get this changed.</P>

	<P>I will.  I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s support and that he may not press this issue.  It is not common in other jurisdictions to have consultation on the safety case.  I am extremely worried about this point, as I believe are all other Members given that worry was certainly reflected during the Committee Stage discussions &mdash; I was very happy about that.  The unconscionable delays associated with the Corrib project are not something we should be proud <Col N="360"/>of, either as a Government or as a country, in terms of how we handle very large investments that are very valuable to this country in energy security and revenues to the State.</P>
        <P>I hope the Deputy will bear with me and perhaps consider withdrawing his amendment because we must try this process and make it slimmer and faster while having a requisite level of public consultation.  It would be dangerous to open the safety case to a public consultation procedure because there is no end to that.  I need not remind the Deputy that some of the people who have opposed this project will never be happy unless Shell move away from this country.  They impose a comparison to the Niger Delta which I do not share or see as being relevant.  That is the kind of mindset one is dealing with regarding some of the people involved.  I am somewhat sceptical of consultation measures and fora of one kind or another that facilitate serial objectors, who are wired up on some kind of ideological or subversive viewpoint, to continually ambush something that is clearly in the national interest.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 11, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(vi) the relevant local authority.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These amendments relate to the matter the Minister of State has tried to deal with in amendment No. 5, which we have just accepted.  It is regrettable that his amendments do not make a specific reference to local authorities.  Individual projects may affect local authorities from the perspectives of planning and access, for example.  Local authorities are in the middle of this stuff, for all sorts of reasons.  I cannot understand why the Minister of State wants to deal with the issue I am raising by including a reference to &ldquo;such other persons as may be prescribed by order by the Minister&rdquo;, rather than by simply referring to &ldquo;the relevant local authority&rdquo;, as I suggest.  I would have thought that in this context, local authorities are as important as, if not more important than, the Department of Health and Children, the National Standards Authority of Ireland or the Department of Transport.  If the Minister of State plans to make that a reality by order, I will accept what he is trying to do.  I do not see why we are not referring specifically to local authorities.  Surely there should be consultation between the Commission for Energy Regulation and local authorities on this issue and similar issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s amendment.  It is an indication of a certain mindset that a reference to &ldquo;the relevant local authority&rdquo; was not included in this legislation as a matter of course.  If we are to take local government seriously, we need to incorporate this kind of provision into law.  Like many of us, the Minister of State is probably aware that there is a great disconnect between the public and the State at present.  There has been a certain loss of confidence.  Local government will be a very important part of the restoration of trust.  I regret the failure to include a reference to &ldquo;the relevant local authority&rdquo; as a matter of course.  It should be seen as an essential part of the provision of a safety framework that reflects the needs and concerns of people at national and local levels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The bodies to be consulted during the designation of petroleum activities and the establishment of the safety framework and guidelines are specified for two reasons.  First, such specification will ensure that any potential for regulatory overlap is kept to a minimum.  Second, it is important to draw on any specific experience or expertise an individual body might have.  A local authority would not generally be in a position to bring petroleum safety expertise to the table.  There is no potential for regulatory overlap between a local authority and the CER.</P><Col N="362"/>
        <P>The Bill already provides a basis for the CER to seek input from interested individuals and organisations, including local authorities, when designating petroleum activities and developing safety case guidelines.  The critical point is that local authorities can be consulted even though they have no particular or specific expertise in the area of safety statements or frameworks.  I assure Deputies that local authorities can be included in the CER&rsquo;s consultation.  However, I suggest that to give them some kind of safety or expertise remit would, in effect, be to give them a power that would not be well judged.  Such expertise does not reside within such organisations.</P>
        <P>I have outlined that, as a result of amendment No. 19, the Bill will provide for a formal public consultation on the development of a safety framework.  We have also discussed amendments Nos. 5, 14 and 26, which provide that the Minister may prescribe other bodies that must be consulted.  Taking all these factors into account, I am satisfied that the Bill provides that the CER can consult a local authority if it considers it appropriate to do so.  Local authorities will also have a good opportunity to independently provide input, if they consider it appropriate to do so.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept these amendments.</P>

It provides that the codes of practice and technical standards used in setting the minimum safety benchmark to be achieved by developers will be specified in the safety framework.  The individual details will be set out in the safety case guidelines that are specific to each designated petroleum activity.  By specifying codes and standards within the framework, the CER can recognise the best practice which a petroleum undertaking must, at a minimum, apply.  This does not obviate the responsibility placed on petroleum undertakings to reduce their safety-related risk to a level that is as low as is reasonably practicable.  An additional benefit of setting out the relevant codes and standards in this manner is that it will remove any ambiguity as to what the appropriate code or standard for each designated activity will be.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 60 together.</P>
        <P>The May 2005 Government decision on the construction of the second terminal at Dublin Airport provided for the selection of the operator of the terminal through an open tender process organised by an independent group.  Consultants were appointed by my Department in 2008 to advise in the first instance on an appropriate facilities management procurement process.  Having considered the consultants&rsquo; report at the end of this first phase, I mandated the consultants to proceed to organise the procurement process.</P>
        <P>The formal procurement started in July 2009 with pre-qualification submissions received in late September 2009.  Following the evaluation of the pre-qualification submissions, the consultants reported that none of the candidates had met the minimum requirements for pre-qualification.  Furthermore, having completed a market debrief process, the consultants concluded <Col N="364"/>that there was a low probability that the process, if restarted, would prove successful.  Unfortunately, I had no option but to terminate the procurement process in light of this advice.</P>
        <P>Following the decision to terminate the facilities management procurement process, I announced, on 10 March, that I was mandating the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, to operate terminal 2, while requiring it to demonstrate that it could do so within a benchmark set by the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR.  In this context, the Dublin Airport charges determination for 2010 to 2014, made by CAR in December last year, has set very specific and stringent operating cost targets for operating an efficient terminal 2.  I have asked the DAA to report back to me within three months on its capacity to operate terminal 2 satisfactorily with effect from November 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my understanding that the DAA did not participate in the pre-qualification competition and was not asked to do so.  It seems the DAA was effectively taken into the winners&rsquo; enclosure while others were excluded.  Why was the authority not required to take part in the pre-qualification procedures?  In respect of those companies that did partake in the process, did the consultants make any recommendations?  The Minister indicated that none of the applicants qualified, but did the consultants make a judgment as to whether any of the companies, despite not qualifying, had the capacity to deliver the requirements they did not meet on technical grounds?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The DAA participated in the process in the sense that it was involved in consultations on standards and so on in regard to the second terminal.  However, it did not participate in the tender procedure.  The process that was recommended to me was that the DAA would submit a benchmark for the operation of the terminal.  The idea was that when we decided which facilities and so on would be managed, the authority would submit a price in a sealed tender document.  That was one part of the process.  The applicants we invited to tender formally would then submit their prices for running the terminal.  If any of those prices were better than the benchmarked price set by the DAA, then that company would win the tender process.  However, it did not get to the stage of benchmarking because none of the applicants was found to be qualified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Minister not agree that this looks to the public like he has simply blown away &euro;700,000?  First, the Department spent &euro;200,000 directly on a process which did not seem to offer any type of result.  I understand three companies &mdash; Goodbody Corporate Finance, Matheson Ormsby Prentice and Mott MacDonald &mdash; were involved in that.  Did they fail completely to offer any type of basis for a competitive tender?  Were they at fault in this regard?  Second, the Department allocated &euro;500,000 to the DAA for providing what amounted to some type of a benchmark.  Did the Department not already have from CAR the Dublin aircraft charges determination for 2010 to 2014?  Did the Department spend money twice in order to obtain the same result in each case?</P>
        <P>In regard to the pre-qualification tenders, did the major companies in Europe with which we are familiar, including Ferrovial, British Airways, Servisair and so on, participate?  Will the Minister indicate which companies put in any type of tender bid to operate the terminal?  Has this entire process merely been a &euro;700,000 scam to enable the Government to come forward and say to workers in the airport that their wages must be slashed by 40% or 50% because terminal two cannot afford them at existing rates?  Does the Minister agree he has gone through an elaborate charade that cost the State &euro;700,000 and which next year my colleagues and I in the Committee of Public Accounts will be investigating?  The &euro;700,000 squandered is in addition to the Minister&rsquo;s ongoing bill of some &euro;110 million.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have set out the reality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision in regard to the running of the second terminal was made prior to my time as Minister for Transport.  I was required to implement the Government decision to put forward an alternative for running the second terminal at Dublin Airport, which had been requested by most people both inside and outside the industry, as well as by most Members of this House with the exception of Labour Party Members.  I do not have available to me within the Department the expertise, skills and knowledge to conduct that process but I had a Government decision which said I must do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Therefore, we employed consultants to advise us, first, on how we might go about such an unusual process.  It was originally envisaged that it would be fairly straightforward to put a new operator in place in the new terminal.  However, significant complications arose from a legal standpoint in that the DAA owned the land on which the facility was built and thus might be found to own the terminal.  The cost of hiring the consultants was partly met by us and partly by the DAA itself.  The function of these consultants was to guide the process in order to secure the best possible deal and the most effective and efficient terminal 2.  As it turned out, there were seven or eight bids, as I recall, but none met the minimum standards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister name the bidders?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot do so.  I am not even sure I should be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall submit a freedom of information request.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may do so if he wishes.  I do not have the information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I saw the list at the time but do not have it with me.  From recollection, most of the companies that are involved in this type of business were represented in the tenders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The key point is that some of the companies that tendered are multi-billion dollar companies which run airports throughout the world and have larger budgets than the DAA and better qualified staff.  Yet they were excluded from this process on technical grounds.  The DAA was never in the race until the race was over, and it got the job without having to undergo proper due process.  The authority got a sweetheart deal which facilitated a State monopoly at Dublin Airport to the detriment of consumers.  Costs at the airport will be higher as a result.  The Minister does not know what the DAA will charge, having given it three months to come up with God knows what figures.</P>
        <P>We want competition, choice and reduced costs.  Is it not a fact that the whole process was a con job to put the DAA in charge of the airport as a State monopoly, and to put the maximum burden on taxpayers as a result?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is absolutely incorrect in his assertion.  The fairest way of doing this was to get the DAA to put in its price at the appropriate time, and then give everybody else the opportunity to put in their prices.  If there was a cheaper price than the DAA price, it would then have been taken.  Unfortunately, if people do not comply with a tender document, whether for technical reasons or otherwise, as the Deputy is implying, we <Col N="366"/>cannot ignore the process.  The Deputy would have me before the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General if I interfered with a tendering and procurement process&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the DAA in a tendering and procurement process?  It was not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in any way at all.  The Deputy made the assertion that this will cost taxpayers, but that is not the case.  When this process was finished, CAR issued a recommendation on prices at Dublin Airport that is very stringent and that will keep the cost very tight for Dublin Airport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have the request for tenders in my hand that the Minister issued in April 2008.  It is a very unusual document as it states that the Minister reserves the right to terminate the assignment after the end of the first phase.  This means that there would only be a pre-tendering phase, which is something I have not seen in similar documents.  Does this not confirm the point that we went through a kind of charade?  Why was this necessary when we knew that the Commission for Aviation Regulation was making its own determination of airport charges?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Terminal 2 is a wonderful investment.  It is a magnificent building and a wonderful piece of infrastructure for the nation.  I commend those who designed and organised it.  I do not believe that people should be flying out of a greenfield site without normal comforts when they are about to go through very stressful travel.  I commend those people, but it is important that the terminal be efficiently run.  Aer Rianta International was a proud standard bearer for our country and competed successfully for many airport management contracts in places such as Birmingham and other places in the US and Europe, so why did the Minister not ask the DAA to put its best case forward, given that it has competed freely and successfully before?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The DAA was going to get the opportunity to put its own best case forward.  That was part of the process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the end of the process, not the beginning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It was part of the process.  The consultants came forward with the proposal that it should be a two phased thing and should be benchmarked.  The right to terminate the competition at the end of the first phase was included in the document just in case there was no second phase, so that we would not fork out &euro;800,000 to the consultants for a phase of work that they were not going to do.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>A procurement process for the Irish Coast Guard helicopter search and rescue service is currently taking place.  As the process is ongoing, there are constraints on what I can say, but I will be as helpful as possible.  The request for tender, which was drawn up with the assistance of various stakeholders, aims to improve the service nationally through <Col N="367"/>the provision of modern helicopters that are safer and more effective than the current 40-year old Sikorsky S61s.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Bidders were required to quote for a number of alternative options in which the target level of service could be provided.  Among these were a 24-hour operation at four bases; a 24-hour operation at three bases; and a 24-hour operation at three bases and a 12-hour operation at one base, the choice of which was to be made by the bidder.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A preferred bidder has now been nominated.  The annual cost will increase very substantially as a result of the provision of modern helicopters, but will deliver a marked improvement in the capacity, range, speed and capability of the service.  This has enabled the Government to select the option which involves 24-hour availability from three bases and 12-hour cover from one base, while still delivering the required level of service.  As a result, the additional funding that will have to be found to meet the cost of the service is somewhat reduced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There will be no change in the 24-hour availability from the Waterford base before July 2013.  While a 12-hour contract is to be negotiated for the subsequent period, the Government is committed to keeping this position under review in the light of the operational requirement at Waterford and the availability of funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A 24-hour service at four bases that costs &euro;27 million per annum will be changed for a 24-hour service at three bases and a 12-hour service at one base, which will cost &euro;50 million.  That is unacceptable, particularly to the people of the south east.  Why is the Minister doing this?  Why is the Minister reducing the time cover?  Notwithstanding that we will have a different calibre of helicopter, surely it will take longer to go from Dublin to Waterford and from there to a distressed ship.  If there is a 24-hour service already in existence, why should people have confidence in a 12-hour service?  It is not acceptable.  The savings come to &euro;1 million per annum, but the Minister wasted most of that on the DAA competition, so surely he could provide a 24-hour service at four locations for safety reasons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy is incorrect in stating that there will be a 12-hour service anywhere along the coast.  There will be a 24-hour service right around the coast.  The Waterford base could go to a 12-hour service after 2013, but there will be a 24-hour search and rescue service in all parts of the coast.  The reason we can do this is that the helicopters involved are 55% faster than the current helicopters.  They are much larger and are much more capable of manoeuvring around clouds and at night, so the service will be improved.  That is reflected in the fact that we are nearly paying twice the current rates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question of whether Waterford will be a 12-hour or 24-hour base will not arise until after 2013.  It will be kept under review at that stage.  The contract negotiations are ongoing and we will try to get the best value possible.  The important thing is that we will have a 24-hour search and rescue service all over the coast.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s decision is wasting money and putting lives at risk.  If there is a 12-hour service in Waterford, then the helicopter will come from elsewhere for the other 12-hours.  No matter how fast it is, it will not get five miles off the Waterford coast by the time a helicopter in Waterford could do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The south-west coast of the UK is currently served by the AW139 helicopter, which is basically the Air Corps helicopter.  If that is good enough for the UK, why is it not good enough for Waterford and for Ireland?  Was the Air Corps asked to tender for this process?  The Air Corps helicopters can provide a 24-hour service and the same safety that is provided by the British authorities.  It is not good enough.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is absolutely right.  It is not good enough.  The UK service is not acceptable at all to me, nor is that kind of helicopter.  The reason we are going for this helicopter &mdash; the newest of the Sikorsky models &mdash; is precisely because the other ones are no longer suitable.  </P>

        <QRef>[12768/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Railway Safety Act 2005 put in place a strong and modern legislative and regulatory framework for railway safety in Ireland.  The legislation established an independent safety regulator in the Railway Safety Commission and an independent office to investigate accidents, the Railway Accident Investigation Unit.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the statutory framework, an independent investigation is being carried out by the Railway Accident Investigation Unit into the collapse of the Malahide viaduct.  I am aware that Irish Rail carried out its own internal investigation and recently published a summary of this report.  The company has also submitted the report to the Railway Accident Investigation Unit.</P>
        <P>The Railway Accident Investigation Unit is required to publish its report not later than 12 months after the date of the incident.  Until this statutory investigation is complete, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the causes of the collapse or the actions that are required as a result, notwithstanding the fact that Irish Rail has published its own internal report.</P>
        <P>It should, however, be acknowledged that significant progress has been made in the past ten years in improving safety on the railway network through the investment of almost &euro;1.2 billion in Exchequer funding over that period.  In 2010, notwithstanding the difficult Exchequer funding environment, a further &euro;96 million has been allocated to Irish Rail as part of the continuing investment in railway safety.</P>
        <P>The Railway Safety Commission is funded by a combination of Exchequer funding and a levy on railway undertakings.  The budget for the commission and the accident investigation unit in 2010 is &euro;2.53 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>All we have is a summary of the Irish Rail report.  Although we only have a few pages of summaries and recommendations, it highlights an appalling failure by Irish Rail management and the Minister to look after the permanent way.  Only for the bravery and courage of a driver, and the warning we got from the Malahide sea scouts, Deputy Dempsey would certainly not be here today as Minister for Transport.  In addition, the management of Irish Rail would have changed dramatically.  We came within a hair&rsquo;s breadth of a desperate tragedy.</P>
        <P>The findings of the report are astonishing.  It mentions a misunderstanding and says that as time progressed, the importance of maintaining the weir profile was no longer fully appreciated.  In other words, the Irish Rail engineers did not realise that the Malahide viaduct comprised a series of piers built on top of an underlying structure.  They had forgotten the basic structure of one of the key bridges in the rail network.  Is that not an appalling indictment of maintenance in Irish Rail?</P>
        <P>Since the disaster, the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland has informed me that original drawings of the Malahide viaduct and other drawings over the past 150 years are available in the society&rsquo;s office in Heuston Station.  I have a photograph taken 30 or 40 years ago of a train crossing the viaduct.  The relevant information was clearly there, yet the report&rsquo;s astonishing finding is that people in the company had forgotten basic maintenance procedures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy on one thing &mdash; that a very serious incident was averted by the quick thinking of the driver in question.  We should all be grateful for that.  I have two roles concerning rail safety, which are to ensure that the policy is correct and to provide as much money as possible for that.  In both of those duties, my predecessors and I <Col N="370"/>have discharged our functions as we should.  I agree with the Deputy that what is contained in the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann report, about forgetting in some ways what they should have been doing concerning the maintenance of the viaduct structure, is frightening.  I certainly hope that the lesson has been well learned by the company itself.  I do not propose to make any further comment on the specific findings because once we have set up the statutory body, the report of which will be public, the proper time to comment is when we have all the facts.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we get the full report and the other two reports that I understand are in train?  The Minister has a responsibility nonetheless.  The Railway Safety Commission has only four inspectors for 2,000 km of permanent way, which we are beginning to add to now.  It is an astonishingly small resource to monitor all that work.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport was told that the Railway Safety Commission has never examined this bridge.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>They had not looked at Rogerstown.  Has the Minister asked Irish Rail&rsquo;s management to make specific changes concerning maintenance and the management of maintenance?  Has he asked the company if all the major railway bridges in the country have been inspected, including Rogerstown, Malahide and elsewhere? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>From inquiries I have made, I am aware that the company has reviewed all its procedures in this respect.  It has examined similar structures.  The Railway Safety Commission is not meant to do the job of the railway company.  The inspectors are supposed to spot check, but the rail company and its linesmen are involved in ensuring that the track is up to date.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>They did not know it either.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I await with interest the report as to why they did not know that, if they are the experienced people in this area. </P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>  if he will provide a detailed assessment of the &euro;180 million cost for repairing damage caused by the recent weather conditions as estimated by county councils; the details of the cost involved for each county council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will provide a table setting out the returns received from county and city councils.  It covers the estimated cost of the response to the recent flooding and severely cold weather, and of road repairs arising from those weather events.  The total estimate is almost &euro;198 million.  This information is being assessed by my Department at present.  </P>
        <P>When deciding on the allocation of over &euro;412 million in Exchequer regional and local road grants for 2010, my priority was to protect the existing investment in the roads network and to target carefully resources to address, on a priority basis, the most urgently required repairs resulting from the extensive damage caused by the recent severe weather.  With that in mind, I simplified the grants structure and gave more flexibility to local authorities to direct funding to these priorities.</P>
        <P>These grants, which supplement expenditure by local authorities from their own resources, represent a very significant investment at a time when public finances are under severe press<Col N="371"/>ure.  They bring the total Exchequer investment in regional and local roads since 1997 to over &euro;6 billion.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The question concerns getting more money, but it is not easy to obtain.  Last Saturday, I visited Kerry, which is the last of the counties I have visited over the past three months.  The last time I was there was in 1991. <Col N="372"/> People all over the country are saying that they will spend their holidays at home this year, given the value offered by hotels.  In addition, improved roads to Galway, Cork, Limerick, the south east and Belfast now have shorter journey times.  One can nearly do such journeys in half the time due to the fantastic road network.  However, money needs to be invested in a lot of smaller county roads where holidaymakers go.  Many accidents take place on these roads.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We have had a good month or six weeks of repair and much work has been done in county councils around the country.  Is there anything more that can be done?  We have a new Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport; I have no doubt she will do a great job and I wish her well in it.  People will be spending holidays at home this year and we do not want to lose any lives because of potholes or bad upkeep of verges on the roads.  Can &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million extra be given to each county to make sure our roads are safe, so that when people decide to holiday at home they will come back with only good memories?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the Deputy, I encourage as many people as possible to take their holidays at home.  The answer to his question about whether there is any more money for local or regional roads is that I do not have any more money.  I have provided the maximum amount of flexibility and the feedback from local authorities, obtained from my talks with officials, has been positive.  They have been given the freedom they need and the system is working well.  If the local authorities require further changes within the allocations provided, I will try to be as flexible as possible without compromising other aspects of the roads programme.  However, I do not have extra money and I do not expect to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>Before we reach the peak holiday time &mdash; perhaps in three months time &mdash; the Minister might review that.</P>

        <Quest>  when the Commission for Taxi Regulation will be incorporated into the National Transport Authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[12774/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Transport Authority was established on 1 December last.  In accordance with the provisions of the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, the Commission for Taxi Regulation will be subsumed into the National Transport Authority, at the request of the authority, on such day as the Minister appoints by order.</P>
        <P>Discussions are currently taking place between the National Transport Authority and the Commission for Taxi Regulation on the details of the assimilation process, such as the integration of financial and information technology processes.  It is important that the assimilation takes place in a manner that ensures an effective transition to the new institutional arrange<Col N="373"/>ments.  I expect this process will be carried out expeditiously and that the integration of the two organisations will be completed over the course of this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying that by the end of 2010 the Commission for Taxi Regulation will be based completely within the National Transport Authority?  The authority will then effectively be the regulator.  I understand that according to the Bill that we put through the House, the current taxi regulator is the last such regulator.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware of the considerable unease in the taxi industry at present, with many taxi workers feeling it is impossible to earn a decent living under the current conditions and the current regulator?  People are going out for three or four hours and coming back with &euro;15 in their pockets, then having to work all night in chaotic circumstances.  Has the Minister met representatives of the Irish Taxi Council and, if not, is he prepared to meet them?  Will he meet with other representative taxi bodies?</P>
        <P>Will he address the major concerns of the council with the Commission for Taxi Regulation?  It is concerned, for example, about the nine-year rule for cars, under which many taxi drivers will be obliged to replace fine cars that are now around nine or ten years old.  In the current circumstances, they will find it difficult to get credit and pay back loans.  Will the Minister ask the regulator to review this rule?  Many taxi drivers have large cars with two-litre engines in fine condition which may be more than ten years old.  Will he consider any of the other issues raised by taxi workers, particularly that of a moratorium on the issue of taxi plates?</P>

	<P Just="Left">Over the last couple of years I have met representatives of the Irish taxi industry &mdash; the established representative bodies which have been there for some time, some of which are unions or members of unions.  They are involved in the consultative process that is currently taking place with the advisory council to the Commission for Taxi Regulation.  The Advisory Council stated in a letter to me dated 16 March 2010:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The industry representative bodies which sit on the Advisory Council have fully engaged with the proper consultative processes and have played their part in progressing a number of initiatives such as the forthcoming introduction of Wheelchair Accessible licences only for taxis and hackneys, stricter rules on transferability of licences, new vehicle standards and the new Driver Skills Development Programme.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Clearly, not only is this kind of engagement the correct and proper route to take, it is also the most constructive for all parties.  The Irish Taxi Council [which is the group the Deputy mentioned] &lsquo;demanding change&rsquo; whilst disrupting the general public cannot possibly be a successful route to improvement of standards.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I agree with the advisory council that the way to change any regulations with which people have a difficulty is through the consultative process and not by disrupting the general public, who have enough hassle in their lives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am relaying to the Minister the deep concerns I have heard from taxi workers in every part of the country &mdash; not just those represented by the Irish Taxi Council but also those represented by six or seven other bodies, including SIPTU.  They all feel we need a coherent taxi service that is up to international standards and run in a different way.  The continuous antagonism between taxi drivers and the regulator, as they see it, must end.  We need a better service but one in which workers can earn a decent living.  That is the reason people want the Minister to intervene.</P>
        <P>It will be on the Minister&rsquo;s own head if there is further disruption in coming weeks, because people want to meet him to tell him about their concerns.  There are almost 50,000 taxi drivers <Col N="374"/>and more than 27,000 taxi plates.  The situation has become chaotic and is out of control.  We need a service that is well organised and also provides people with a good living.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is not reflecting the views of the established taxi organisations on the current process.  The taxi advisory council, whose letter I quoted and which represents these organisations, is satisfied with the level of engagement and accepts that things are happening and that change is taking place.  It is part of the process of consultation.  I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point that whether people are in the Irish Taxi Council or some of the other representative bodies, they are in difficult circumstances.  However, this is a result of the state of the economy, and there is no easy solution except to restore the economy.</P>
        <P>With regard to achieving change in the taxi regulations and the implementation of recommendations made by other bodies, including the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, the proper way to do that is not by engaging in disruptive behaviour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>  when the Road Traffic Bill 2009 will be enacted; when the reduced blood alcohol limits will be introduced; his views on the Road Safety Authority survey that stated that one in three drivers believes it is acceptable to drink and drive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[12873/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Road Traffic Bill 2009, which is currently before the D&aacute;il for Second Stage consideration, provides for the lowering of the legal blood alcohol concentration to 20 mg per 100 mL for learner, novice and professional drivers and 50 mg per 100 mL for other drivers.  The lower limits will be introduced following the enactment of the Bill and when the necessary evidential breath testing, EBT, instruments for testing at the lower limits are available.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Medical Bureau of Road Safety has commenced the procurement process for the new EBT instruments, following which the new instruments will be evaluated and tested by the bureau over a six-month period.  The Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s recently published national survey of driving attitudes and behaviour shows a 71% level of approval for the new 50 mg limit and 73% in favour of the 20 mg limit.  The survey also shows that 61% believe the legal limit of alcohol is one drink, after which a person should not drive, and 90% indicated they had not driven a motor vehicle in the past 12 months after consuming two or more alcoholic drinks.</P><Col N="375"/>
        <P>Overall, the RSA survey results show a significant hardening of people&rsquo;s attitude towards drinking and driving in the country and indicates a profound change in the public&rsquo;s attitude over the past decade.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On this the House is <i>ad idem</i>.  I very much welcome the results of the survey from the Road Safety Authority, which shows the profound change over years in public opinion.  The voices in this House which have argued for a reduction in the alcohol limit have been proved to be in tune with public opinion.  Unfortunately, there are the likes of Deputy Mattie McGrath in this world who do not want change and have articulated a view that one can drink and drive.  That is no longer acceptable.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister continue, with the Road Safety Authority, to provide a budget particularly for bringing about awareness of the effects of drink on people?  The key point is that no matter how low the levels of drink, it can affect how people drive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy and it is my intent to continue to support the RSA in its education profile.  It is a good example of at least one area where across parties people have been constructive and positive in the implementation of policy and the highlighting and support of issues that needed it.  I hope it will continue as it is a matter of life and death as far as I am concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The best briefing I got on the Bill as it stands was from Ms Susan Gray, Ms Donna Price, Ms Ann Fogarty and Ms Teresa Leonard.  They are great road safety activists from the PARC organisation and they are very anxious to meet with the Minister when the Bill emerges from the House.  I wonder if he could facilitate such a meeting as these people have a deep understanding of the issue; each of them suffered an horrendous tragedy in their own family, which has been the basis of their terrific campaign over recent years to bring about safer roads.</P>
        <P>We hope the Bill will begin Committee Stage soon and the Minister might indicate when this will be.  We clashed before about the evidential breath testing, EBT, machines so what is the timeframe on the recalibration of the machines?  Issues have also been raised about intoxilyser machines which will be in Garda stations and the fact that their tolerance is too high compared with the UK and Northern Ireland.  Has the Minister any views on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The process involving the testing, tendering and purchase of machines started on the day I put the Bill into the public domain.  I did this in order to cut at least six months off the normal time taken to procure such instruments.  The largest and most complex part of the process relates to the EBTs.  The current versions, approved and supplied to the Garda stations, could be recalibrated to the 50 mg limit but could not be recalibrated to the 20 mg limit.  I have asked the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, to purchase the new generation of EBT instruments, which will be capable of measuring all the range.  It has begun the process and we are coming to the end of the process where people identify and submit interest in tendering.</P>
        <P>Samples must be evaluated by the MBRS and these are tested over six months, which will be in the latter half of this year.  At the end of that period, towards the end of this year, it is expected that they can be approved by January 2011.  They are then moved to Garda stations and over a period of approximately six months they will be installed in Garda stations and garda&iacute; will be trained in their use.  They will be ready for operation by that summer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with others in congratulating the Road Safety Authority on this turnaround and the reduction in deaths so far this year.  We have our fingers crossed as the chairman as indicated that we could end up with a sudden shock over just one long weekend.</P><Col N="376"/>
        <P>I know the Minister has covered the possibility for garda&iacute; to form an opinion that somebody is under the influence of a drug other than alcohol but will the availability of testing kits be further explored so that garda&iacute; might quantitatively and qualitatively know that somebody has been taking an intoxicating substance that could influence driving?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is something which has exercised everybody on all sides of the House.  The impairment tests are being legislated for.</P>

	<P>Garda&iacute; can also form an opinion and do a test later.  We are working with the EU to see if we can get a roadside testing kit that would assist in the issue.  I assure the Deputy that we will pursue the matter and try to ensure an effective testing system for drugs other than alcohol.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 76 and 94 together. </P>
<P>I have not received proposals for the development of new aircraft maintenance or engineering initiatives at Dublin, Shannon or Cork airports.  In any event, these would be matters in the first instance for the Dublin Airport Authority, which operates the three State airports, and for the relevant development agencies.</P>
        <P>I have not had discussions with Ryanair on its plans for hangar 6 at Dublin Airport, nor have I been specifically briefed by the company on other locations for the company&rsquo;s proposed new maintenance investment.  I have been in close contact with the Dublin Airport Authority and my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, while she was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, on the use of hangar 6, which is leased to Aer Lingus.</P>
        <P>In recent correspondence with Ryanair, the T&aacute;naiste has confirmed her wish to focus constructively on the possible alternatives to hangar 6, which include the use of available existing hangar space, new builds on available sites on airport land or some combination of the two.  The legal position on hangar 6 has been set out comprehensively by the CEO of the DAA in his statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport on 24 February.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="377"/>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">During the controversy, was the Minister briefed by Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary or others in Ryanair on the proposal for hangar 6?  Does he have any information on where the much-talked jobs were located?  I did not notice it mentioned in any press release from Ryanair.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We got a good report from Mr. Barry O&rsquo;Leary of the IDA at a meeting of the transport committee.  He mentioned that hangars 1 to 6 were increasingly occupied by Aer Lingus, Ryanair, Dublin Aerospace and a garage operation.  He told us hangars 3 and 4, which were then fully available to Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary and Ryanair, were in a process of negotiation for a major maintenance project.  Is the Minister aware of this?</P>
        <P>With regard to aviation jobs in general, it is my understanding that since mid 2008, Ryanair removed approximately 500 jobs from the three main Irish airports in Dublin, Shannon and Cork.  Was the Department given any information on this?  I tried to raise this with the Minister on a number of occasions but I did not notice my Fine Gael colleagues jumping up and down about the loss of 500 critical jobs.  Those were real jobs which would have been created at the three main airports but they have now gone elsewhere.  Does the Minister have any comment to make on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I was not briefed by Ryanair at any stage.  I did not seek a briefing in respect of the hangar 6 issue, nor did I receive one.  I was, however, fully briefed by the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment at that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>She is still T&aacute;naiste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I also had meetings with officials in my Department and their counterparts from the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Furthermore, I had brief discussions with representatives of Aer Lingus at one stage.  I was, therefore, fully briefed about the matter while events were unfolding.</P>
        <P>Hangars 3 and 4 were available to Mr. O&rsquo;Leary at the time.  One of these hangars is similar in size to the facility at Prestwick, while the other is larger.  For some strange reason, however, a facility the size of that in Prestwick did not appear to fit the bill in Dublin.  As the Deputy is aware, Dublin Aerospace had an interest in some of the buildings at Dublin Airport.  Subsequently, that company established operations in hangar 5 and part of hangar 1.  In addition, an aircraft painting company was due to move into certain of these buildings.  The contract in that regard was awaiting signature prior to my departure abroad to carry out my duties for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and, as far as I am aware, that contract was signed.  Much of the hangar space that was available at the airport is no longer unoccupied.</P>
        <P>I cannot inform the Deputy with regard to the exact number of people Ryanair has made redundant in Ireland during the past ten to 15 months.  I cannot argue against the figures he provided.  As a result of cuts on routes from Shannon, Dublin, etc., I have seen a number of different figures from Ryanair in this regard.  Announcements of job cuts of that nature on the part of Ryanair are usually accompanied by a tirade of abuse against the Government, individual Ministers, the DAA or whomever.  The purpose of this is to distract attention away from the fact that such jobs are going elsewhere.  That was the case in this instance, when Ryanair decided to try to create as much of a smokescreen as possible.  That is par for the course with this company.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a disgraceful comment.  The Minister has launched an attack on a company that creates jobs.  Over 432,000 jobs have been lost in recent times.  Deputy Dempsey is the second Minister to indicate that he neither met or sought a meeting with <Col N="378"/>representatives of Ryanair in order to discuss that company&rsquo;s proposals.  Is it not a fact that Ryanair wrote to the Department, etc., stating that it wished to create 500 jobs?  However, those in Government did nothing about it.  Is it not the case that last week some Government Ministers went the extra 10,000 miles in order to try to attract jobs from New Zealand or wherever?  Not one of them thought to travel to Dublin Airport in recent months in order to secure jobs.  Instead of flying around the world, the Ministers to whom I refer should have sought a meeting with Michael O&rsquo;Leary in order that they might discuss his plans with him.</P>
        <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister failed to do this?  His fundamental duty of care is to try to attract jobs to Dublin Airport.  He is the line Minister with responsibility for the DAA but he did not seek to attract these jobs.  He has again attacked, in a disgraceful fashion, a company which has created thousands of jobs and which is one of the largest airlines in Europe.  This illustrates the Minister&rsquo;s completely callous attitude to the company in question and the jobs it creates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am only stating facts.  I have the utmost regard for the achievements of Ryanair, which has created jobs, brought down the cost of air fares, etc.  I have no difficulty acknowledging that.  Ryanair is an Irish company and on a number of occasions my Department has been obliged to make representations at European level in respect of cases it has brought to its attention.  I do not have a problem with regard to being even-handed in respect of this company.  Equally, I am entitled to express my views.  If the Deputy can find something untrue in what I said with regard to the tactics that are used by Ryanair, he can inform me of that fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>There is little point in rehearsing the history of this matter.  It is clear to everyone that an opportunity was missed.  Will the Minister outline his view on the current position at Aer Lingus?  Staff are being threatened that they will be let go and then re-employed.  All the while, they have also been informed that they will be able to avail of Government redundancy packages.  Is this not an abuse of both taxpayers and the workers at Aer Lingus?</P>

	<P>The matter to which the Deputy refers has been the subject of discussions at the LRC and is now the subject of a ballot among staff.  I hope there will be a positive outcome for the company and for the employees concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It appears Mr. Mueller and the Aer Lingus management team were on the verge of acting illegally in the context of the course they were allegedly going to pursue in respect of vulnerable cabin crew.  It must be noted, however, that the wages and conditions for such crew appear to be set in Ryanair&rsquo;s headquarters.  That is one of the difficulties that arises.  I reiterate that ten aircraft &mdash; which were making an important contribution to the economy &mdash; were withdrawn from this country and we have not had an opportunity to discuss the issue in the House.  My colleagues in Fine Gael did not think the Ryanair cuts worthy of being raised here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A few weeks ago the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Calleary, informed Senator Brendan Ryan and I that the process relating to the globalisation fund is so long and convoluted that it will be the end of the year before moneys will become available to the 800 former employees of SR Technics.  Many of these individuals are commencing courses in aviation engineering at DCU and other universities. <Col N="379"/> They already trained as engineers and are now intent on moving one step up.  However, the colleges do not have the funding to facilitate them in this regard.  There will be an eight-month wait before funding becomes available.  In view of the importance of aviation to the country and its economy, would it not be possible for the Government to assist these young men and women in completing their training?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is broadening the scope of the question to an unacceptable degree.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>At least Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s supplementary was somewhat related to the matter under discussion.  I do not know the answer to Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s question on the former employees of SR Technics and the globalisation fund.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The process is extremely slow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  I will take the matter up with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to see if something could be done for those involved.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also referred to the difficulties at Aer Lingus and the cuts that have been made.  I accept that the process involved is very painful.  I do not know where the wages, etc., are being set.  I am not sure they are being set by Ryanair or anyone else.  The aviation industry is experiencing an extremely difficult period.  Aer Lingus needs to continue with the process it currently has in train in order to try to survive.  Sacrifices were made by Aer Lingus employees in the past.  I am of the view that the case which has been put forward to the effect that cabin crew previously made major sacrifices is not unreasonable.  Unfortunately, as a result of the downturn in both the economy and the aviation industry, they are being asked to make even further sacrifices.  I am confident that if Aer Lingus can achieve what it has set out to achieve, there are better times ahead for both it and its staff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Ryanair is one of the largest airlines in the world and has 231 aircraft.  Aer Lingus, another excellent company, has only 45 aircraft.  The difference in scale is massive.  It would have been great had we attracted additional Ryanair business to Dublin Airport.  I would fault the Minister and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan, for not taking action in this regard.  A year ago, Ryanair proposed to create 500 jobs at Dublin Airport.  Now, however, those jobs have disappeared.</P>
        <P>We have no control over Ryanair, which is the only airline that is creating jobs in the aviation industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>And taking jobs out when it suits it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is reducing costs and overheads.  The State has an influence through the Government being a shareholder in Aer Lingus.  That is the point.  However, I accept what the Minister stated.  The Aer Lingus company is under excellent management now and it is time for both sides to get together &mdash; and most people are together on it &mdash; and vote on it, seal the pact and save the airline.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that it is wonderful to have an airline as commercially big, powerful and strong as Ryanair.  I have no difficulty accepting that and stating that it is a good thing which has helped competitiveness in the aviation sector here also and that is extremely important.  From the point of view of these jobs, every facility was given to <Col N="380"/>Mr. O&rsquo;Leary and the T&aacute;naiste met him because it was her area of responsibility at the time.  The best thing I could state is that if anybody really wants to know how serious the situation was they should look at the evidence given before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and the behaviour of the witness before that committee and form their own judgments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 79 together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Priority Question No. 62, answered today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The key point is that journal 143 of the Irish Railway Record Society, which can be referenced very easily on the Internet, would indicate to Irish Rail, the Minister, me or anyone who cared to look at it, the issue of the Malahide viaduct and how it was constructed.  There is a 12 page article on it by a gentleman who works for Irish Rail, Oliver Doyle.  I find it entirely unacceptable that Irish Rail can have a self-serving summary of the conclusions of the report without the complete report being published.  Is it not a fact that Irish Rail should publish the complete report?</P>
        <P>The regulator, which is the Railway Safety Commission, has served a compliance order on Irish Rail with regard to the Malahide viaduct, the content of which it is refusing to disclose.  To have confidence in railway safety, and Question No. 75 from Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe also covers this, we need to know exactly what the Railway Safety Commission specifically stated to Irish Rail about the Malahide viaduct.  That should not and does not in any way prejudice the accident investigation unit, which is an entirely different and separate activity.  I want to know what is going on, what the Railway Safety Commission knows and what it stated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope and expect, and by law I know, we will get the report from the railway accident investigation unit, which is independent of, but part of, the Railway Safety Commission.  I agree with the Deputy that the maximum amount of information must be made available and made public.  However, all of the facts and investigation should be completed and then all of the information should be made available.  The report has to come out within 12 months from when it was commissioned so a maximum of four months remains.  It can do the report earlier and I hope it would be in a position to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Separate to anything else, the Railway Safety Commission has made a finding on the Malahide viaduct and I believe the contents of that report are very significant and I want to know what they are.  The key issue is that the Government promised to make the Railway Safety Commission operate under the Freedom of Information Act.  The statement of strategy of the Railway Safety Commission, which is on the Internet, states that pending that order being made it will abide by the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act and make information available in a free and proper manner.  It is refusing to do so.  It creates concerns for me and all travellers on that line that it refuses to do so.  It is not good enough.  I should not need to have a conversation with the person who is acting head as that person should <Col N="381"/>respond to my freedom of information request, which is an entirely separate matter to the railway special investigation unit.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether the Minister has the same view but I believe Irish Rail&rsquo;s attitude to all of this is shameful, disgraceful and self-serving.  Hundreds of people could very easily have died in that accident.  It did not do enough to make it safe.  In 1998&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;an initial report on safety adequacy found that it was one of the most potentially dangerous locations in the country for a rail accident.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy provide me with a note on what he has raised?  I do not want to give a commitment that I will be able to give the Deputy that particular report because as I understand it the report may feed into the investigation unit.  I agree that we should have maximum information if it will not prejudice the investigation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call.  We should have the three reports in full.  The bit of information we have raises many questions.  It reaches a damning conclusion but it raises many questions.  Was the Minister shocked by the reference that the 2006 scour report, which Irish Rail conducted, decided it would investigate only underneath the piers six years later, in 2012?  That seems an indictment of maintenance procedures.  It is incumbent on the Minister to publish it.  Questions must be raised about the Railway Safety Commission.  We passed the Bill to establish the commission five years ago and it was established four years ago.  It has very small resources and I felt its performance at a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport was not sufficient and that was before this near disaster occurred.  Will the Minister review everything about the Railway Safety Commission?  The history of recent years reveals that a series of regulators, from the banking industry to building control, was not just light touch but non-existent.  Was railway safety part of the same cancer, in other words non-regulation?  The Minister should look at the commission as well as at Irish Rail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is being unduly harsh on the Railway Safety Commission, if he does not mind me saying so.  We have had an excellent record up to this particular incident, which I agree could have been a huge disaster.  Once we have the report I want maximum disclosure and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport could review it.  If issues arise for any agency, body or the company itself we should discuss them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my two colleagues&rsquo; call for full transparency on the investigations taking place.  The Government has a terrible tendency to delay reports.  It is eight years since a young child died in care and we are receiving the report now.  However, I will stick to the Malahide issue, which was extremely serious and in which several hundred people could have drowned.  The report and the bit of information we have to date suggests that nobody knew and it was nobody&rsquo;s fault because people left and they did not tell other people.  What sort of a company are we running?  We are back to PPARS &mdash; nobody is responsible or accountable.  Fortunately, nobody was killed.  Is this lack of culpability, responsibility, accountability and transparency in a semi-State body acceptable to the Minister?</P>
        <P>It is not acceptable to me or to people in my constituency or elsewhere in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone should be fully accountable for actions or lack thereof in particular areas within this company or any other.  However, the normal manner in which this is done is within the company.  The board, in the form of the chairman and board members, is there to do so.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="382"/>

	<P>They are not doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate it is my understanding that apart from the separate investigations to be conducted by the Railway Accident Investigation Unit, RAIU, Irish Rail also conducted its own internal review and report in this regard.  All the details and data have been passed on to the RAIU and I am sure this also will be referred to in the report.  I agree with the Deputy on one point, which is there should be transparency and openness and people should know the exact position.  However, people should be given the opportunity to do a thorough job in investigating before producing a report.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>  his views on whether national road safety has been compromised after 18,000 drivers who had committed road safety offences got away without a single penalty point being applied to their licences; the proposals he is developing with the Department of Justice and Law Reform to address this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[12798/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to state at the outset that more than 70% of fixed charge notices are paid within the statutory prescribed 56-day period and that penalty points, where appropriate, are applied as a consequence of making such payments.  Where fixed charge notices are not paid, the matter is dealt with by way of summons to appear before the courts.  There is already an obligation on a person appearing before a court charged with offences under the Road Traffic Acts to present his or her driving licence to the court.  However, the Road Traffic Bill 2009 amends existing provisions to facilitate administrative procedures in the courts by obliging a person to also bring a photocopy of his or her licence for presentation to the registrar, clerk or other principal officer of the court.</P>
        <P>This proposed amendment arose during the extensive discussions with key stakeholders, including the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that preceded the drafting of the Bill.  The Bill also includes a number of provisions to facilitate the endorsement of penalty points where a licence record does not exist and for foreign driving licence holders, as well as to bring foreign driving licence holders into the scope of the application of sanctions for road traffic offences, including a disqualification from holding a driving licence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The public were shocked to learn that so many drivers had got away on this technicality.  Moreover, when this was allied to the issues concerning non-Irish national drivers and drivers from Northern Ireland, people concluded that the penalty points system is a farce.  Has the Minister made further progress in respect of the mutual recognition of penalty points with Northern Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>This is being done jointly with the United Kingdom and at present we await a report from the United Kingdom&rsquo;s authorities in this regard.  The United Kingdom is the lead authority on this issue as we were the lead authority, with Northern Ireland, regarding the mutual recognition of disqualifications and, consequently, we are in their hands to an extent.  While progress is being made, I acknowledge there will be a three to four year period before the two systems can be aligned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>While I accept the Minister has made progress in this regard, cars from Northern Ireland still drive at extremely high speeds on the M1 every day of the week. <Col N="383"/> When will the authorities be able to deal with this problem effectively?  The Minister has acknowledged this is a serious matter and I am surprised it has not been dealt with heretofore.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I apologise for my late arrival in the Chamber.  First, as a former public servant and as a former member of the union which is in dispute, I deeply regret what has been happening within the Passport Office.  I believe the union has made a fundamental error.  I do not make this point as a union basher as most Members who know me will know the opposite is the case.  I have much time for this union and in particular for its leadership, which showed great leadership and courage during the recent referendum campaign in particular.  However, I must apologise on behalf of the Department and the Government to those who have had their plans destroyed or certainly upset, as well as for the extraordinary inconvenience, suffering and frustration that has been caused by the delays in the passport service.</P>
        <P>The second point I should make is that over its long period of operations, the passport office has been a good operation.  It issues up to 600,000 passports per annum or approximately 12,000 passports per week and during peak periods, it handles approximately 20,000 passports per week.  Consequently, the capacity exists and were people working to rule, it could be used to purpose.</P>
        <P>Deputy Timmins has made a number of important propositions outside the House, for example, augmenting current staff.  As he is probably aware, this would be normally the case at this time of year, but it is not currently possible.  The passport service must operate to international standards, including those drawn up by international organisations such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, and the US Department of Homeland Security.  Unfortunately, there is no room for shortcuts in the process.  It must be handled in a professional way.</P>
        <P>Since the Passport Office operates with large volumes, any curtailment of processing would soon lead to a major backlog, as we are seeing.  The CPSU action has resulted in a build-up of 44,000 applications in the system.  Last Friday&rsquo;s action was particularly regrettable, as it undoubtedly caused a considerable amount of disruption.  Long delays in processing passports has resulted in a collapse of confidence in the system, a legacy with which we will all need to deal.  In other countries that previously experienced a loss of confidence in their passport systems, only a return to guaranteed turnaround times restored confidence and, consequently, a lessening of pressure at public counters.  The Minister and I are acutely aware that a loss of confidence will take a significant time to overcome, that frustration has been caused and that there will be an IR legacy.</P>
        <P>The industrial relations action is slowing down the overall process.  As Deputy Timmins pointed out, the CPSU has blocked the recruitment of temporary workers, which would have been normal at this time in the Passport Office.  Demand for passports is seasonal, but it is 11% greater this year than it was last year.  As concern has set in during recent days, a flood of passport applications into the system is adding further to the problems.</P><Col N="385"/>
        <P>As Deputies know, there was a particular problem last Friday when the CPSU provided the Department with only very short notice of its intention to withdraw from public counter services.  It was not possible to advise all callers directly as to their actions and the passport service management advised on its website when notice of the position was received on Thursday.  The difficulties with the public office did not start last Friday.  They had been building for a number of weeks.  The Department appealed to the unions to put off their strike action last Friday.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, made the same appeal last night, an appeal that I renew.  It is not in the interests of the public service to be in conflict with the general public.  Those who are suffering are members of the general public.</P>
        <P>On 16 March, accommodation and sophisticated equipment in the Passport Office were destroyed.  It is important to put on the record that they were destroyed by a water leak that occurred overnight despite the suggestion that they might have been destroyed otherwise.  That a production unit will be out of commission is adding to the difficulties.  The two remaining production units were receiving the normally scheduled preventative maintenance, work that concluded yesterday.  With one unit out of action for the medium term, it was prudent to ensure the other two units received their scheduled maintenance.</P>
        <P>The Deputies asked about the further action that can be undertaken.  The Minister has asked the union to consider its position, particularly on the employment of additional personnel.  The backlog will take some time to clear.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interests, including those of the public service unions and their relationship with the general population, to accede to the request.  Suggestions have not been made just by our side of the House, but from the other side of the House as well, to curtail the action.</P>
        <P>Having said this, I appreciate that the unions have a job to do.  It is not easy for unions, particularly those representing lower paid public servants, to accept the types of restriction that recently needed to be placed on pay.  However, it is a time of sacrifice across the economy.  No part of the public sector system should impose additional hardships on families at this time of year.  I would welcome any supplementary questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this Private Notice Question.  I also thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I have a number of questions for him.  Does he agree that the reason for this difficulty in the first instance is the Government&rsquo;s policy of pay cuts?  Had it followed Fine Gael&rsquo;s advice and started enacting pay cuts above the &euro;30,000 level, it would have been carrying out a far more equitable policy.  The decision to reverse the pay cuts in respect of the higher paid added fuel to the fire.</P>
        <P>Does he also agree there is an implicit right in the Constitution to travel?  Thus, an individual has a right to transport, a right that the State should be in a position to honour.  The European Convention on Human Rights, to which we are signatories, recognises the freedom of movement.  This indicates that a State should be in a position to issue passports to its citizens.  Does he agree that it is outrageous for the general public to be inconvenienced in such a manner?  Members of the public are innocents in this matter.  Some are queuing at the Passport Office and thousands more are waiting at home awaiting their passports.</P>
        <P>This is not a question of someone hoping to go to the Costa del Sol for a holiday.  It is a question of students going abroad on educational matters, people going abroad on personal appointments and business people travelling.  They have all been inconvenienced.  The general public cannot be held to ransom by one of the State&rsquo;s unions.  It is inappropriate.  This is not a go slow.  Rather, it is a strike in everything but name.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State also agree that the Passport Office has provided an excellent service to date?  It is a credit to the advances made by sections of the public service in recent <Col N="386"/>years.  This work to rule has brought the office into disrepute, undeservedly so in some sense.  The workers are being held to ransom by their union leaders.</P>
        <P>At a committee today, certain issues were raised, including the extension of the valid period of passports as per section 9 of the Passports Act 2008 and the issuing of emergency travel documentation as per section 15 of that Act.  It would appear both sections, due to security difficulties and international agreements with the aviation organisations, are not options.</P>
        <P>Two options are available.  First, the dispute could be ended.  Will the Minister of State confirm whether approximately 50 temporary workers have been sanctioned to do the work and clear the backlog within a few weeks?  Temporary workers are taken on every year during this peak period, but the CPSU has placed an embargo on their being taken on board.  It has also placed an embargo on overtime.  That a machine is out of commission is irrelevant to the time taken to process applications.  The CPSU action is the only blockage.  Are temporary staff available to come on board straight away and clear the backlog?  Will the Minister of State join me in asking the union to call off the go slow, which has been of considerable inconvenience to the public?  We have seen the difficulties it has caused people in recent days.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Second, we could outsource the service.  If the State cannot guarantee through its public service that members of the public can travel freely by getting a passport, we should outsource the service.  In 2008, a KPMG report suggested that the passport service should undertake a cost benefit analysis of producing passports in-house and outsourcing that production before the end of the useful life of the current APS hardware.  The same report outlined how the Netherlands, UK and Denmark have outsourced their services, which have operated successfully since.  Has this cost benefit analysis been conducted?  Does the Minister of State agree that, if the dispute is not resolved, the facility should be outsourced?  We are here to serve the public interest, not any sectoral interest.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that Deputy Timmins made suggestions with a view towards helping.  However, escalating the conflict with the trade union would not necessarily help.  I agree with him that the union should give serious consideration to reviewing and reversing its position on overtime and the taking in of temporary staff.  Many of the temporary staff are people who have been employed over the years in this capacity.  It is strange, to put it no stronger than that, for a trade union, at this particular time, to take a view that employing additional staff is a wrong thing to do.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with Deputy Timmins that simply blaming the paycut policy of the Government is a solution.  This is a reality which we all face.  Of course, I have no doubt I would make the same point if I were sitting across the House.</P>

	<P>Deputy Roche soon will be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>We are borrowing more than &euro;340 million per week just to keep the public services ticking over.  A very high proportion of that is going on pay.  It is clear that the Government, whoever is in government, must balance the books.  We cannot continue to borrow at that level.  It would not be wise or prudent to talk about reversing this situation.  In fact, I would be absolutely opposed to that.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Timmins that it is a citizen&rsquo;s right to travel.  It is a fundamental right and enshrined in national and international law, the Lisbon treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the many measures we have enacted.  That is why the action taken by the trade <Col N="387"/>union in this case is singularly ill-advised.  It will create bad feeling between the union and the general public, who are being grotesquely inconvenienced.  There is something fundamentally wrong, in the 21st century, in people having to queue from 3 a.m.  I heard a lady from Donegal speaking on a radio programme earlier today.  She said she left her home at 3 a.m. to come to Dublin because a passport was urgently needed for a child who wants to travel to engage in some activity.  That is wrong.  Public service unions, notwithstanding industrial relations disputes, must be aware of this.</P>
        <P>I am not entirely convinced that outsourcing public services is the best way to go.  I have never been a big fan of outsourcing public services.  However, the Deputy is right when he says outsourcing has worked very well in the Netherlands and is working in the United Kingdom.  I am not sure of the precise position in Denmark.  In so far as it is possible to run an efficient, effective and cost-effective service, we should do so within the public service.  That is why I think the action of the trade union in this case is so ill-advised.  In terms of the long-term relations between unions and the public it is an ill-advised action.  I join with Deputy Timmins in calling on the Civil and Public Service Union to reconsider this, reverse its action, resume overtime and allow temporary workers to take up their positions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing us to raise the private notice question and I am grateful for the Minister of State&rsquo;s replies so far.</P>
        <P>We had an opportunity earlier today of raising some of the issues at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The meeting was attended by senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, who were forthright and complete in their answers.  Nevertheless, I will make a few important points.</P>
        <P>First, there is no point in imagining there is not a background to this dispute.  It is that the burden of the fiscal adjustment has fallen overwhelmingly and disproportionately on the very large number of people in the lower grades of the public and Civil Service.  I will not dwell on this but I say it as a former Minister who looked at a small army of civil servants who were very far below those on middle and high incomes.  In fact, some of the lower civil servants in my Department would have qualified for family income supplement, such were their circumstances.  That is a factor.  That being said, the advancement of their working conditions should not be at the cost of quenching the right to travel and to hold a passport with such grievous discomfort as is taking place, in Molesworth Street in particular.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State may be sympathetic to the following point.  Given my introduction to my supplementary question, it would be appropriate to locate this issue in the general context of the talks between the Government and representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  There is considerable merit in that.  The issues at the background of this dispute are not particular to it.  They are elsewhere as well.  If progress is being made in the talks between Government, the ICTU and mediation forces it would be useful to attach this dispute as quickly as possible to that process, giving, as it does, the opportunity of transcending the particular difficulties.</P>
        <P>Second, if a backlog of 44,000 is threatening to rise to 50,000 it would be useful to arrange a place for queuing to take place in less distressing conditions and to break the large number of cases into categories.  This could be done through the tracking system, which would give people an idea how long they will be waiting.</P>
        <P>I share the Minister of State&rsquo;s reservation about outsourcing.  It has not been the success people claim.  Outsourcing of passport provision depends on the capacity to produce a secure document, to meet security conditions and to achieve international acceptability.</P><Col N="388"/>
        <P>Members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs  heard how Ryanair, for example, has rejected out of hand the suggestion that it would, like other low cost carriers operating out of Belfast and other airports, accept other documents as photographic proof of identity.  I find this extraordinary.  Some low cost operators flying out of Belfast are doing this but Ryanair has said flatly that it will not even consider it.  If we are, correctly, to stress the constitutional right to travel as something which should not be defeated by the trade union right to representation neither should the constitutional right to travel be defeated by intransigence and by putting identification verification conditions in place which have no legal basis.  These requirements have no legal basis in European law.  In fact, they are in contravention of certain aspects of European law.  Even as one is dealing with an emergency, every attempt should be made to remove as many people as possible from the 44,000 so that one has a smaller volume to deal with when a resolution is achieved.  Measures, such as extending the validity of passports and seeking forms of renewal not located in Molesworth Street, have been proposed to achieve this reduction.</P>
        <P>The rejection by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the CPSU statement as being &ldquo;too little too late&rdquo; is unfortunate.  Waiting for the moment when the union is forced to withdraw all of its actions before a resolution is possible will prolong the dispute.  I would have preferred if yesterday&rsquo;s CPSU statement had been seen as a window of opportunity.  I appeal that it be revisited and that the dispute be attached to the talks between Government, congress and mediation.  This may offer us the shortest possible journey to a resolution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Higgins, particularly for his last point.  If this is seen as a battle to the death on issues of principle, the people who will suffer most are those queuing outside.  Ultimately, the reputation of a good service will suffer too.  The reputation of public administration, which has already taken a hit because of certain types of industrial action, will also suffer.  </P>
        <P>I will mention to the Passport Office the issue of proper queuing arrangements.  There is something fundamentally undignified in the 21st century in people having to queue outside from three or four o&rsquo;clock in the morning.  That is not acceptable.  I am not sure how we can deal with the queuing issue but I will certainly make that point.</P>
        <P>Deputy Higgins also mentioned the intransigence of a private operator.  Public administration is where bureaucracy is supposed to exist and not in the private sector.  One would have thought Ryanair would be a little less bureaucratic and a little more open, provided security requirements are met and proper proof of identification is presented.</P>
        <P>Deputy Higgins also made a very useful suggestion that the backlog of applications should be broken into different batches of those which are urgently required and those which are not.  Given that we are approaching holiday time and everybody is making arrangements, in light of the current publicity surrounding the issue, it would be difficult to persuade anybody that his or her case is less urgent that somebody else&rsquo;s case.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also mentioned the talks that are under way.  They are at a very preliminary stage.  We have to deal with the trade unions in good faith and make it clear that they understand fully the difficulties facing the Government.  We do not have any wish to be at war with the trade unions.  We certainly do not have any wish to be at war with public servants, particularly low paid public servants.  The Deputy is correct in saying that the pay of clerical officers and clerical assistants, the grades represented by the CPSU, are not grand salaries.  I accept that.  I served with some people in those grades and I was a member of that union and of its executive.  Returning to the Deputy&rsquo;s first point, the burden of adjusting should not fall, as the <Col N="389"/>Deputy said, on junior public servants.  It certainly should not fall on citizens who have legitimate business with which to deal and many of whom have urgent business with which to deal.</P>
        <P>I handled a matter raised by a person from Donegal, which was brought to my attention over the weekend.  The person had to travel to New York to see a person who was dying.  In all humanity that is a case that is critically urgent and the system should be able to handle that.  I heard Deputy Timmins mention a case earlier of young people who are due to travel abroad for particular reasons, that they do not have a passport and that they perhaps should have applied for one six months ago.</P>
        <P>We have had an excellent passport service.  I fear greatly that there will be a legacy in this regard and in that respect I draw attention to the point I made, a point Deputy Timmins made and a point that was implicit in what Deputy Higgins said.  The trade union took a step forward last night and it has shown great leadership on issues in the past.  I mention in particular the general secretary of the union who has taken something of a lambasting in recent days.  I ask that the trade union rescinds this action and allows the 50 staff who have already been passed to come in and to allow them to work overtime.  We can continue the discussions.  At the end of the day this dispute will be resolved.  Everybody realistically knows that it will have to be resolved by discussion.  It certainly will not be resolved by imposing any further hardship on the travelling public in this country.  I thank the Deputies for their contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate that we have an opportunity to discuss this crisis this afternoon.  I, on behalf of my colleagues, thank the Ceann Comhairle for providing us with this opportunity.  As the Minister of State will be aware, coming from Donegal, one of the jobs a public representative is asked to do is to arrange for the processing of a passport application in Dublin in emergency circumstances.  I must compliment the officials and staff in the Passport Office on the service they have provided down through the years.  They have been co-operative, obliging and have looked after us in emergencies, as have the officials in Iveagh House in helping to process a passport in emergency circumstances at a weekend.  </P>
        <P>The queue that had formed outside the Passport Office by 8.45 a.m. when I was passing it along Molesworth Street and down Kildare Street was unbelievable.  That cannot be tolerated.  We have to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned the case of a person from Donegal.  A constituent of mine had to travel by motorcycle from Donegal to Dublin to collect his passport before 1 p.m. last Friday.  Thankfully, he got it and then he travelled back to Donegal.</P>
        <P>Many people in the country who have applied for a passport do not know the status of their applications.  I have suggested to some constituents that in emergency circumstances where a person has to travel, be it on a holiday or for some other reason, any person who was born in this country prior to 1949 is entitled to apply to the British Embassy on Merrion Road for a UK passport, which would be processed in two or three days.  I do not know if that is widely known.  There are people in Donegal and in other parts of the country who are at their wits end and they will head to the British Embassy.  If what is happening in the Passport Office on Molesworth Street continues for much longer, one will see a queue forming outside the British Embassy.  I have recommended to a number of people in emergency circumstances that if they cannot obtain a passport through our Passport Office to apply for a passport to the British Embassy and that they will be facilitated.  I do not know what is the view of the Minister of State on that.  He probably does not qualify for such a passport on age grounds.  It was a declaration of the Republic that anyone born here before 1949 is entitled to the UK passport, but I believe that would be the last resort for people.  This problem is causing widespread consternation and the greater the distance one is from Dublin the more difficult one finds it.</P><Col N="390"/>
        <P>It is great that a passport facility is in place in Cork.  The passport service should be regionalised.  There is no reason a passport office could not be provided in the north west, Galway and the south west.  When the dust settles and this dispute is resolved, that solution should be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The case has been put to the Minister of State to declare his eligibility for such provision and we will wind up the discussion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not necessarily agree.  We should solve our own problems here.  It took us long enough to get independence and to get to this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be a satisfactory route to take but if the Government cannot facilitate people, they may have to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>If people cannot get a passport, they do not have any other alternative.  I am not recommending it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a much more peaceful exchange before Deputy Ring came in; he probably qualifies for such provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true that one can qualify for a British passport on those grounds?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is.  This is a serious issue and it is a reflection on the current state of affairs.  Like outsourcing, I am not sure that this is the solution.  The solution is in our own hands.  I join the Deputies who made the point that we would ask the trade union to allow staff to work overtime, to rescind this action and allow the additional staff to come on duty.  I thank the Deputies for their contributions.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have to brief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State believe it is right that a person living in Blacksod, Erris or in Westport in Mayo&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>

        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow me to ask this question because this is not a matter of fun; there is a passport facility in Cork.  If a problem arises concerning a passport application of an applicant from Westport or Bellmullet, the applicant has to take the train or drive to Dublin to sort out the matter.  This has happened on numerous occasions.  That has been the position before this dispute arose.  I have a simple question for the Minister of State.  Has he or the Government any plans in this respect?  Why should people have to travel to Dublin to get a passport?  The Government has a policy of decentralisation.  Why must people from my county <Col N="391"/>have to travel to Dublin to get a passport?  More people from County Mayo than from any other county have queued outside the Passport Office today because there is not a passport office in County Mayo.  That needs to be examined.  We do not even want an office; we need a facility where people can get a passport rather than having to travel to Dublin to get one.  Does the Minister of State consider that is a reasonable request?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>What is not reasonable is that any citizen, whether he or she is from Blacksod, Erris, Bellmullet or Donegal, should be inconvenienced.  That is not reasonable.  I am not sure about the practicalities of having a passport office in every county.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>One should be provided in the west.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>In the north west. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a good idea to open the office in Cork.  I think it is working well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an excellent service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In the fullness of time perhaps the other issue should be examined.  Sadly, wise as the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion may be it will not solve this dispute right now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>When the dust settles that suggestion should be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be an office in Galway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It may well be something that should be considered, but I am not in a position to do that.  I recognise the validity of the fact that there has been a call from Deputies  for further decentralisation of the service.  I am not in a position to give an undertaking on that and the Deputies will understand that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister of State inform me if the Government has any plans on how it might deal with the issue of passports or has it definitely ruled out the concept of outsourcing the service?  The Department was asked to examine that option by KPMG in 2008.  If this dispute continues, we cannot allow the public to be held to ransom.  We must examine a mechanism to provide for the issuing of passports.  That is our first obligation. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that there is an issue to be examined here.  I have put my own views on outsourcing on record; I am not a fan of it.  We should deliver public services through the public service.  That is my general view on this and on other areas, but the reality is, as the Deputy knows as well as I do, that even if there was a decision in the morning that the service was to be outsourced, it would present significant logistic difficulties to get to that point.  It would not solve this dispute.  The only solution is for the union to rescind its action. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment that the talks between the Government and mediation facilities are at a preliminary stage, is there not considerable merit in asking that the talks address this particular dispute as a serious obstacle to progress?  Will the Minister of State convey that message to those involved in the talks to ascertain whether the dispute is blocking the advancement of the talks at a more general level?  In that way, the matter could be resolved. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="392"/>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will accept, the talks are highly sensitive.  It would not be wise, therefore, to set preconditions.  However, the logic of the position dictates that the trade unions at all levels and specifically the union involved in the dispute reconsider their stance.  I say this as someone who was a member of the executive of the union in question and is not in any sense a union basher.  What is being done is terribly damaging and also dreadfully frustrating for the general public.  I thank Members again. </P>

This will add to the robustness of the process as the safety guidelines will establish beyond any doubt what are the relevant standards with respect to each specific designated authority for the purposes of safety assessment in Ireland.

	<P>I am not clear about what the National Standards Authority of Ireland does or what its role is.  The Bill states that the standards and codes of practice applicable to designated petroleum activities will have been formulated or recommended by the authority.  Essentially, the CER will have to take guidance from the authority.  Is that how it will work?  Is there expertise within the authority in respect of the petroleum industry to do that?</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>f</i>) a comprehensive public information and consultation process has been undertaken to inform and reassure locally effected populations of the safety considerations relating to the project.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This goes back to my big issue with the Bill, namely, that it must contain a very strong element of public consultation and the giving of reassurance to the public on matters of risk and safety and other issues in respect of projects.  To try to be helpful and in an effort to get some consensus from the Minister of State, I will be happy to withdraw amendment No. 31 with a view to pressing amendment No. 32.  If this is done a company would not be required to undertake a comprehensive public consultation process during the putting together of a safety case.</P>
        <P>In regard to amendment No. 32, I wish to see the commission providing for a submissions process to allow the public to express concerns relating to a project if such concerns exist before a safety permit is issued.  I am trying to meet the Minister of State half-way by not making the putting together of a safety case over-bureaucratic for companies, over-expensive and time consuming.  However, before a safety permit is granted to allow work to proceed there would be, as part of the permit process, an opportunity for local people or experts to make submissions that might be relevant and of concern to the local community for the CER to consider before granting a work permit.  This is the nub of the issue in light of our earlier discussions on public consultation at the framework stage and during the putting together of safety frameworks.  A community wants to have its say before a permit is granted to allow work to commence.  I accept that we cannot have public consultation processes at every stage without having time or other kinds of limitations regarding companies and the CER.  However, we should require it before the permit is granted.  On that basis I shall withdraw amendment No. 31 in order to press amendment No. 32.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s amendments.  Having listened to the concerns raised on Committee Stage, I believe that the additional public consultation process I proposed in the context of the safety framework, together with the existing consultation process in the designation of petroleum activities and the development of safety <Col N="397"/>case guidelines, allows a high degree of access by the public to both the establishment and implementation of the safety framework regime.  I believe there is now sufficient scope for any concerns members of the public might have to be addressed.</P>
        <P>The chair allows for submissions on framework and guidelines.  The Bill also provides that the permit must be published so there is no secrecy about the outcome and there is no precedent internationally for this type of approach, as I pointed out at earlier stages in this discussion.  The commissioner for energy regulation has a public remit and therefore is always open to the public in that regard, like any public body which may be subject to submissions, views, lobbying or whatever is required.  Commissioners are not shrinking violets in that regard but are open to representation of one kind or another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, the Minister of State is missing the point I am trying to make.  Putting a safety framework in place is essentially a policy direction.  Yes, there will be an element of accepting from the public views, considerations, concerns and so on and I accept that.  However, I do not believe this will happen.  Unless one is dealing with the specifics of a project, namely, a safety case or a decision regarding a permit for a certain project, the local communities in question will not become involved in the consultation process.  There must be some way of reassuring local communities that a project that will impact on their environment and, potentially, on their way of life and property is safe, properly thought out and has been through all the necessary permit arrangements.  My party&rsquo;s proposal is to give those people a say, if they want it, when the safety framework is being put in place.  Otherwise they would not even know it was going on.  This is head in the sand stuff.  They will not even know that a project will affect them in the future until they see a safety case that relates to a petroleum project and the permitting of that project.  That is what will get the interest of local communities.  Otherwise we will be telling them they did not make a contribution to the generalised safety framework which was made six months before.  They would not have done this because they would not even know it was happening.</P>
        <P>It is when a community is concerned and potentially confused about the impact and safety consequences of a project that we must ensure the people have their say and that there is a proper information flow between the CER and the public to ensure that people do not believe in conspiracy theories and that they understand there is a regulator which considers their safety concerns to be of paramount importance.  The permit stage, when a decision is being made to allow a project go ahead, is when the public must have information and the chance to formulate and ask questions.  We do not provide for that anywhere in this Bill and as a result there will be repeats of what we experienced in Corrib, namely, ugly and damaging scenes that not only damaged Ireland&rsquo;s reputation in respect of investment and the encouragement of future oil and gas exploration but also was very damaging to the local communities involved.  I believe the Minister is making a mistake and for that reason I shall press amendment No. 32.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We must put this in context.  There is an oral hearing in the planning process and the actual environmental impact process will deal with this, as will the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is important to remember that the CER will be represented at these hearings.  It is not the case that the public will be outside the loop concerning the safety of what is being proposed in individual projects.  They will be in the loop because we have a planning process that allows them to be.</P>
        <P>With respect to Deputies Coveney and McManus, who have borne with this legislation, if we add an extra layer here we will invite further potential vexatious or ideologically motivated ambushes.  As I said earlier in the debate, the process is already causing significant problems from the perspective of investment in offshore exploration in Ireland.  I agree with Deputy <Col N="398"/>Coveney that we are at the nub of it here.  As Minister of State with responsibility for natural resources, I am speaking from personal experience when I say that innumerable people have decided not to invest here, or not to apply for licences, precisely because of the reputation we have generated for ourselves as a result of the Corrib project.  Although I have only been in this job since last May, I am aware of a number of cases in which approaches were made by investors and people on the ground who represent international exploration companies.  Their personnel and key executives on the ground were very positive about investing in Ireland.  They accepted that we have tried to streamline the process and make it easier for them to invest here and create jobs.  When they returned to their global boards, in London or elsewhere, the boards decided not to invest because of what they had seen, read and heard from their own analysts at headquarters level.  They did not believe their own executives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is trying to bulldoze things through.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not suggesting we should bulldoze anything.  If we add an extra layer as proposed by Deputy Coveney, we will do what is not done in other jurisdictions.  One of the big problems, from an investment point of view, is the legacy of Corrib.  As a result of that case, many people are not prepared to apply for Irish exploration licences.  There is a perception that the process is difficult, cumbersome and bureaucratic.  They believe that a multiplicity of permissions is required in the safety area and in other areas.  Officials in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources are working on this process pretty much night and day.  They are trying to make it simpler, easier and more in keeping with what happens internationally.  If we do not do that, there will not be any jobs.  As the Deputy is aware, the oil situation is causing many exploration companies to take risks in deeper waters like those off the coast of Ireland.  They are keen to do so.  However, there is a very negative attitude towards Ireland in this area.</P>
        <P>As someone who worked in business, I am most worried about the fact that the global boards of companies are saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;, even after their key executives have recommended that licences be applied for.  There is a perception that our system is cumbersome, unwieldy, difficult and subject to ambush by conspiracy theory.</P>
        <P>We have managed to confuse this whole area with different processes.  We are at the nub of it here.  I accept that Deputy Coveney is approaching this issue with the best of intentions.  To be honest, this problem is not just a feature of this area.  I will not bore the House with my views on the manner in which, over the last ten years, we have made other areas much more bureaucratic than they should be.  I will put my hands up in that regard because we have been in Government for that period.  I strongly believe it is time for this country to reduce the obstacles that inhibit inward investment in Ireland.  We should allow such investment to occur.  While I appreciate the support I have received today, and admire Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s approach to this legislation, I cannot go along with what the Deputy has proposed in this instance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to make a final point.  I agree with some, but not all, of what the Minister of State has said.  I do not think all of the concerns are spurious or are led by conspiracy theories, although some of them may be.  There are plenty of people who have genuine concerns.  In my view, they have an entitlement to make comments and ask questions before it is decided to grant a safety permit for a big project that will affect their <Col N="399"/>communities.  We are not providing for that in this legislation.  I am withdrawing my amendment that asked for &ldquo;a comprehensive public information and consultation process&rdquo; to be undertaken as part of the safety case being made by a company.  The amendment I am now pursuing states, &ldquo;the Commission shall before deciding whether or not to issue a safety permit, allow for submissions to be made by the public in relation to safety issues or concerns relating to the project under consideration for a safety permit&rdquo;.  I am asking for a ten-day period &mdash; or any other period the Government may decide on &mdash; to be provided so that local people, or anybody else, can make submissions.  I suggest that the CER be required to take note of such submissions before it makes a decision on a permit.  That is a useful belt and braces approach, as well as a useful pressure valve that will allow the local community to get its concerns off its chest before a decision is made.  It is not an extra layer of bureaucracy.</P>
        <P>If we have learned one thing from the Corrib affair, it is that when the State takes a hardline approach to try to drive things through &mdash; when it reduces the process in terms of bureaucracy, etc. &mdash; it does not work.  It has not worked.  People resist that type of approach by digging their heels in.  They are prepared to martyr themselves for their communities, if necessary by getting sent to prison.  That is why Ireland is now perceived as a country in which it is difficult to develop this kind of project.  Rather than providing for some kind of tokenism after decisions are made, or at some early planning stage when local people do not even know that planning is taking place, which will be the case with the safety framework proposal, we need to find imaginative ways of giving local communities an opportunity to speak before decisions are made.  I have made my case.  I will withdraw the more extreme amendment, which would have imposed an extra layer of bureaucracy and expense on companies.  I will press the more moderate amendment, which would give local communities an opportunity to express concerns in writing to the CER before decisions are made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appeal to Deputy Coveney to understand that as part of the current planning process, local communities can have their say at the oral hearing stage, at which representatives of the CER are present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that they can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In other words, anything that is required &mdash; letters, submissions or campaigning statements &mdash; can be done as part of the planning process.  The approach advocated by the Deputy is already provided for in the oral appeals stage of the planning process.  The important point is that officials from the CER are present at such hearings.  They can respond to local people in that context, just as I am responding to the Deputy now.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The CER will be represented at the oral hearings.  Not only will its officials will be able to respond to specific local and community concerns, worries and anxieties at that forum, but they will also be in a position to respond further in writing at a later stage, if necessary.  There is no problem with people making submissions at that time.  Those who make representations may receive a direct response during the oral hearing process, or by means of a letter at a later stage.  As a public personage who has the responsibility of an executive position in the Government, I am responding to Deputy Coveney in an open public setting.  In the same fashion, local concerns can be publicly addressed during the oral hearing stage of the planning process.  The Deputy is asking me to replicate that, in effect, at a later stage in the process.  I do not consider it necessary to do so, as it would represent a move beyond international best practice in this area.  I will leave it at that.</P><Col N="400"/>
        <P>I accept that the Corrib case is exceptional.  There are differing opinions on it.  As a Minister of State who is trying to promote and encourage investment in offshore exploration, I am open to the accusation that it is inevitable that I would hold my particular view on it.  That is how I define my job in the context of the ongoing recession.  I am in the business of attracting investment in exploration to this country and cutting out any undue delays and forms of bureaucracy that are over and above what is internationally regarded as best practice.  Governments are often accused of creating more bureaucracy.  The Opposition has often alleged that this Government has created too many quangos.  I do not disagree with the assertion that we have done that in recent years.  It is time to unwind these bureaucracies and make it easier and safer or people to do business and, ultimately, create jobs here.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the completion of the passage of the Bill through the House.  It is important that we have dealt with an issue of safety that was highlighted as a result of the controversy surrounding the development at Corrib.  Some good has come out of that sorry saga.  I thank the Minister of State for his openness in accepting amendments.  That approach is to his credit and has improved the legislation.</P>
        <P>The only offence I took to the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks is that he thought we on this side of the House might use the word &ldquo;bureaucratise&rdquo;.  That is not a word that comes from this side of the Chamber.  The large volume of legislation coming through from the Department is to the credit of all, particularly the civil servants involved.  However, it has led to a type of practice which has not, in my experience, been the norm in the past and is not the intention of the process itself, whereby at each Stage, including Report Stage, new amendments are being introduced by the Minister.  The recommittal process was most unusual in the past but is now becoming the norm because of the productivity of the Department.</P>
        <P>I offer the Minister of State the warning that this is not a good way to produce legislation.  I recall one instance where the name of a Bill was changed twice as it made its way through the House, along with major changes being made to its content by the Government.  Our job is to <Col N="401"/>scrutinise, but we cannot do so if Government amendments are put forward without sufficient time for consideration.  It is great to see the Department&rsquo;s enthusiasm, but at the end of the day, if one runs too fast one will end up falling.  It is important that we take our time over all these matters.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>By way of information for Deputy McManus, ours is a small Department and the officials work extremely hard on a very heavy legislative workload.  However, I will reaffirm to the officials who work under my direction that they should, when bringing forward additional amendments in transit, partake in comprehensive briefing of Opposition Deputies.  I am open to making sure there is fuller and better briefing, where necessary, from officials directly to Members opposite.  I agree with the Deputy that amendments should not be introduced in that manner, but it inevitably happens because of the pressures under which the Department is working.  The compensating measure, if it is to happen, should be that Opposition Members are briefed regarding such amendments in a better and more timely fashion as the legislation is moving through the House. </P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill, which affords us an opportunity to discuss many of the issues relating to road safety issues and to consider the Government&rsquo;s priorities in this area.  Most of the focus in regard to this Bill has been on blood alcohol limits.  There is no doubt that the consumption of alcohol impairs driving and is a direct contributor to road accidents.  However, I intend to question the proportionality of the proposals before us, an issue that is being ignored in the debate.  I have no doubt that a reduction in the blood alcohol limit will have an impact in terms of road safety, but I would question whether we are using a sledge hammer to crack a nut and diverting limited resources from the real causes of road accidents.</P>
        <P>Any measure that saves lives must be given serious consideration by everybody in this House.  However, the Government seems to be of the view that it has overall ownership of the issue of road safety, despite its own unimpressive record in this area.  The recent decision to downgrade motorway public lighting specifications in order to save a few euro is a case in point.  While the issue of costs is pressing in every area of expenditure, a decision to save a few euro on the operation of public lighting on motorway junctions, where vehicles are travelling at 70 mph, is of doubtful merit.  Nothing has been done to address the decision by the former Minister for Transport, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan, to increase the speed limit outside some of the busiest schools in the State.  During the severe weather after Christmas, salt was not available for gritting roads, which caused numerous accidents and marooned many people.</P>
        <P>In the debate to date, certain figures have been thrown out as facts.  The reality is that figures can be twisted in a particular manner to support a particular agenda.  We have had lies, damned <Col N="402"/>lies and statistics.  Statistics can be and are used to support any argument whatsoever.  The latest figures that have been published by State agencies and are publicly available show that in 2008, seven out of ten samples tested by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety were over the legal blood alcohol limit.  Of these, 85% pertained to the old limit of 100 milligrams per 100 millilitres.  The legislation before us will do nothing to deal with that particular figure, which has been ignored.  Moreover, one in six of those found to be over the legal limit was two and half times over the limit.  This legislation will have absolutely no impact in this regard.  Given a conviction rate of 52% in 2008, there was a 50:50 chance of getting away with having a blood alcohol level of more than 100 milligrams per 100 millilitres, as was the case in 85% of those found to be over the limit.</P>
        <P>This issue is being shoved aside because it is a question of putting the resources in place to ensure prosecutions are secured in the case of motorists identified as being far in excess of the legal limit.  When the former Garda Assistant Commissioner, Mr. Eddie Rock, attended a meeting of the joint Oireachtas committee, he pointed out that garda&iacute; spend between 40 and 100 hours preparing a drink driving file for court.  Yet after all that time and effort in the context of limited Garda resources, half of the infringements detected do not result in prosecutions.  This scandal is being ignored because it reflects poorly on the Government.</P>
    
        <P>We hear much about the causes of accidents.  It was interesting recently to hear Mr. Noel Brett make the point that road conditions are the cause of 3% of accidents.  He is not able to provide figures on accidents caused by blood alcohol levels.  He will say that alcohol is a contributing factor for a percentage of accidents.  When he wants to airbrush out the issue of road conditions, he will use one set of figures, yet when he wants to steer an argument in another direction, he will use another set of figures.  The problem is that we do not have proper figures on the cause of road accidents in this country.</P>
        <P>We are awaiting the first report of the Garda forensic collision investigation unit.  I would like to see the exact causes of accidents in this country.  The reports are being complied by the 42 forensic crash investigators into fatal accidents or crashes causing serious injury that have occurred on our roads.  They will give us for the first time a clear record of the causes of accidents in Ireland.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There has not even been an acknowledgement by the Government or the Road Safety Authority that the global accident risk exists.  This is the baseline for road accidents, because once somebody sits into a car and turns on the ignition and moves the vehicle, there is a statistical probability that he or she will be involved in an accident.  We have never calculated that figure here.  That will give us a baseline on which we can develop our road safety policies.  Why have we not done this?  How big a factor is tiredness, listening to the radio, using a mobile telephone, driving a car with children on board, or driving on medication?  We do not have figures for these factors.  We do not even have an accurate estimate on the potential rate of accidents on those factors.</P>
        <P>Research has been carried out in this area in the UK, and the police there have been investigating road accidents for years with the type of thoroughness that the road accident investigation unit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has recently been using.  The British police examined 2,613 fatal accidents that occurred in 2005 in that country.  According to its research, 66% of road accidents were due to driver error or incorrect driver reaction to a certain situation.  Behaviour and inexperience were the main factors in 25% of accidents.  The road environment was the main contributing factor in 15% of accidents.  Pedestrians contributed to 13% of accidents by not looking properly.  Alcohol, surprisingly, caused only 5% of deaths on UK roads. <Col N="403"/> The figures for alcohol related deaths in this jurisdiction may or may not be lower than 5%, but the figures show that alcohol is not a big factor in the UK.</P>
        <P>The argument in favour of reducing the blood alcohol level here has been based on the road accident statistics for 2003.  That research was provided to us by the Road Safety Authority.  It states that there has been no assessment of the implications of alcohol since random breath testing was introduced in this country.  Surely we should be assessing the impact of random breath testing.  I have no doubt that this form of testing had a huge impact on alcohol consumption by drivers when it was introduced.  We know that the resources given to the Garda to enforce this since its introduction have fallen dramatically, but if we were to highlight that, it would lead to a bad reflection on the Government and it is far easier to bring forward another Bill than deal with the issue of resources.</P>
        <P>The HSE report in 2006 based on road accident statistics in 2003 showed that 5% of fatalities involved drivers with a blood alcohol reading of 20-80 milligrams.  Of those involved, 24% were over the legal limit &mdash; this will not be addressed by the Bill &mdash; and 7% involved pedestrians who are over the legal limit.  Alcohol was a factor in 36.5% of fatal crashes, two thirds of which involved those who were over the current legal limit.  The mean blood alcohol level based on that study was 99.2 milligrams per 100 millilitres, which is 25% over the current legal limit.  The mean blood alcohol level for males at 107 milligrams per 100 millilitres was 34% over the legal limit.</P>
        <P>Mr. Noel Brett was quoted in the <i>Sunday Independent </i>in November, when he gave an interview to the newspaper as chief executive of the Road Safety Authority.  I have a high regard for Mr. Brett.  He has done a great job as the head of the RSA, and the authority has brought the issue of road safety to the fore in this country.  However, he states in the article that &ldquo;It is time to provide people with the facts . . . It is estimated that alcohol is a contributing factor in one in three fatal collisions.  That is a fact&rdquo;.  My problem with the Bill is that we are using estimates and quoting them as facts.  I am not just highlighting this now.  I have made several contributions on road safety over the years and I have constantly highlighted this issue and stated that we must provide the accurate data to support the case being put forward.</P>
        <P>A case is being made for the alcohol factor.  There is no doubt that any amount of alcohol will impair drivers, but I question the level of that impairment and the amount of resources put on it.  For anybody involved in a road traffic accident with a level of alcohol in the blood, alcohol will be considered as a contributing factor in that accident.  However, there was a case last year of a young man who left a suicide note and drove his car into a lake.  He had drink taken, so alcohol was considered to be a contributing factor in the statistics.  In an another case, an elderly driver had a heart attack at the wheel of his car and ploughed into a group of men who were smoking outside a pub.  Drink driving had nothing to do with the accident, but it is considered to be an alcohol related accident if one of those individuals is killed.</P>
        <P>Another piece of research was carried out on single vehicle collisions in County Kildare by Dr. Cliona McGovern and Professor Denis Cusack in November 2006.  It makes for very interesting reading.  It examined the issue of single vehicle accidents, so does not deal with pedestrians or other drivers.  I believe that it provides a more accurate reflection of the impact of alcohol on road traffic accidents.  These results clearly show that the majority of driver fatalities in single vehicle accidents are well in excess of the legal limit, with the greater number being twice or three times over the legal limit.  This is consistent with the Medical Bureau of Road Safety&rsquo;s annual reports, which continually highlight the large volumes of alcohol that people have consumed prior to being involved in a road accident.  I would question the real potential benefit to be gained from reducing the blood alcohol limit to 50mg.</P><Col N="404"/>
        <P>In 2002, the Canadian Traffic Injury Research Foundation examined this specific issue.  The report&rsquo;s conclusions stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Our critical review of the evaluation of the research literature failed to support strong, consistent and unqualified support for the lowering of blood alcohol limits.  At best, the results were mixed and the methodological weaknesses in the studies questioned the robustness and veracity of the evidence.  There is little evidence that lowering the blood alcohol limit from 80mg to 50mg will in, or of, itself result in fewer alcohol-related deaths.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">According to the Canadian estimates, implementing and enforcing a 50 mg limit would double the amount of arrests with few, if any, savings of lives to be shown for it.</P>
        <P>The chairman of the Irish Road Safety Authority, Gay Byrne, has said in the past that he would be in favour of enforcing the existing law.  There is a strong case to be made for enforcing the existing law, which is being ignored to a great extent.</P>
        <P>Random breath testing has brought down the monthly averages of people caught for drink-driving.  It has also contributed to bringing down road death rates to the lowest levels since records began.  Those figures are based on research by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Road Safety Authority.  However, we are basing our argument for a reduction in the drink-driving limit based on 2003 figures, which pre-date the introduction of random breath testing.</P>
        <P>In the first full year since random breath testing was introduced in 2007, there was a 9% reduction in the number of people caught over the legal limit.  In 2008, the second full year of random breath testing, there was a 23% reduction in the number of such offences.  It is clear, therefore, that random breath testing is working.  We should be giving garda&iacute; the resources to enforce these measures because there is substantial evidence to support this approach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The thesis being used to reduce the blood-alcohol limit is flawed.  If the Minister has figures on this matter I will be happy to accept them, but having gone thorough a lot of the research I have yet to see these figures.  By reducing the limit from 80 mg to 50 mg, I am afraid we will be diverting limited resources from serious offenders who are blatantly ignoring the law.  They are putting the lives of all road users at risk.  It also diverts us from the scandalous situation whereby we are failing to secure convictions.  Even if someone is two or three times over the legal limit, there is only a 50% chance of their being caught.  We are air-brushing that out of the whole debate, however.</P>
        <P>We are also ignoring the issue of drug use and abuse by drivers.  Some 76% of specimens analysed by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety in 2008 were certified for the presence of drugs.  They were not just illegal drugs, as there is a significant problem concerning people who have prescribed drugs in the blood stream, which is having an impact on the standard of driving in this country.  Those issues are being ignored, however.  We are putting far too much focus on one particular aspect without putting resources where they are needed.</P>
        <P>Many of those who have contributed to this debate raised the issue of rural transport and rural isolation.  The lack of rural transport is a bigger issue for people during the day than at night.  The CSO&rsquo;s research shows that 50% of rural families have difficulty accessing public transport.  In recent months, we have seen services being curtailed; some 100 Bus &Eacute;ireann services have been withdrawn.  For example, the last bus to Westport, taking in Athlone, Roscommon and Castlebar, leaves Dublin at 2 p.m.  That is supposed to be a public transport service, but in reality we are seeing a clawback of resources for any type of public transport.  The Minister pays lip-service to that issue, while at the same time allowing Bus &Eacute;ireann and <Col N="405"/>Dublin Bus to curtail their level of services dramatically.  That is a disgraceful situation and should not be accepted.</P>

        <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this legislation.  Unfortunately, we have all witnessed, either personally or through friends, the devastation caused by road traffic accidents.  My number one priority, and that of every Member of this House, is to protect people from death or injury on the roads.  If one life is saved by enacting this legislation, then we will have done a good day&rsquo;s work.  I would not want the hurt and devastation of a road accident to be visited on any other families if I could prevent it in some way.</P>
        <P>We cannot have an &agrave; la carte approach to road safety, picking and choosing what we like, while ignoring what we do not like.  We cannot decide to be a little bit safe.  In recent years, there have been many accidents on the roads.  I have been to too many funerals as a result of road accidents involving friends, past pupils and others I knew well.  Some of these accidents occurred as a result of speed or were drink-related, while others happened through no fault of the road accident victim.</P>
        <P>It is also important to recognise that not all road accidents result in fatalities.  We have all seen the television advertisements which depict the disastrous and life-changing effects of road accidents.  We must surely do everything in our power to reduce those statistics even more.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s provision that people who drive for a living will be subject to a blood-alcohol limit of 20mg.  Bus and taxi drivers have a duty of care to their passengers.  Such drivers should have a zero alcohol limit, but I understand that this is not practical because there are certain substances, like mouth-washes, that may contain a small amount of alcohol.  This would make it difficult to enforce a zero limit.  Professional drivers who are responsible for the safety of others on the roads need to be doubly responsible.</P>
        <P>We all have a duty to ensure that we drive safely.  Despite the imposition of penalty points, it horrifies me to see drivers still using mobile telephones.  Despite all the warnings and regulations, they continue to engage in this practice.  One cannot give the road one&rsquo;s full concentration if one has a telephone to one&rsquo;s ear.  In some cases &mdash; I have also witnessed this &mdash; people attempt to write text messages while driving.  This is a dreadful practice and it needs to be stopped.</P>
        <P>Deaths on our roads have been reduced but, as I said before, one death is one too many.  We need to keep up the momentum and keep repeating the message.  We must encourage people not to drive if they take a drink.  The message is getting out there.  I do not think anyone in this House would condone drinking and driving.  If one wants to drink, one should appoint a designated driver.  People should not use their mobile telephones and should certainly reduce their speed.  We have all seen, in towns and villages throughout the country, the boy racers who continue to drive at excessive speeds on our roads.  As the saying goes, it is better to arrive late than dead on time.</P>
        <P>More than 40% of road accidents are due to excessive speed.  We need to ensure our young people are well prepared before they take to the roads.  Young people often think they are invincible and a car gives them a sense of power.  However, they must be responsible, because a car is a dangerous weapon.  We have all witnessed the bad driver, the person out to impress, the show-off, the erratic driver, or the one who overtakes a line of cars at speed or on a <Col N="406"/>dangerous bend.  We must redouble our efforts to ensure these people are caught, as they pose a danger to themselves and to other sensible and responsible road users.</P>
        <P>What about pedestrians?  Are they not entitled to walk on our roads?  They are, but they also need to exercise caution.  How many times on a dark winter&rsquo;s evening have we come across pedestrians with no reflective jackets or lights, perhaps wearing dark clothes?  They too have a duty to be responsible when they take to the roads.</P>
        <P>I welcome the mandatory alcohol testing of drivers involved in road traffic accidents.  This is necessary as it enables verification at the scene of the driver&rsquo;s blood alcohol level and clears the innocent driver straight away.  I welcome the fact that this Bill gives the Garda the power to form an opinion on whether a driver is under the influence of alcohol or drugs and to carry out tests in this regard.  Unfortunately, people are using drugs and driving, and this must be dealt with in order to improve road safety.</P>
        <P>Many people have mentioned rural isolation.  I agree with Deputy Naughten that rural isolation is a major issue, but it is more of an issue during the day than at night.  Rural transport is a also major issue, and I commend the Minister on ensuring the rural transport scheme remains in place.  Much good has been done throughout the country due to the provision of services by Irish Rural Link.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P>Not at night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretConlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Margaret Conlon</NameTxt>
	<P>However, we are not achieving value for money.  School buses might do two runs in the morning, perhaps to a secondary school and a primary school, and the same in the evening, but during the day they are not being used.  Like my colleagues, I believe we could obtain greater efficiency by using these buses to better effect, particularly in rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>All transport issues should come under the Department of Transport, including school transport and HSE transport.  If one Department was responsible for everything, we would have a better service and achieve greater efficiency.  At present the service is fragmented.  We need a system that ensures those who are isolated are able to obtain transport.</P>
        <P>In my constituency we are lucky to have the Balti bus service and the Cavan rural link service.  These provide a valuable lifeline to rural communities.  They provide an opportunity for people to go to town with their neighbours and friends, to carry out their business and to have social interaction, which is important.  I am delighted, as I said, that the Minister has committed to continuing his support for these services, as they are the only transport services in many areas.</P>
        <P>Public transport does not exist in rural Ireland.  Now that Bus &Eacute;ireann is seeking to reduce services, these transport services are even more important and deserve to be supported and enhanced.  Rural isolation is a major issue and one about which I am concerned, as are many Members of the House.  It is not, however, solely related to alcohol or to visiting the local pub.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Coming from a Border constituency, I am concerned about many aspects of road safety, particularly the practice of anti-social driving behaviour on the main Clones to Cavan road, the N54.  I raised this issue with the Garda Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, at the recent British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in Cavan, and I have had ongoing discussions with his office in this regard.  This stretch of road is being used irresponsibly by some drivers.  The practice is highly dangerous and poses a considerable threat to other road users.  There is a 3km stretch of the road that crosses north of the Border on two occasions before coming back into the South, so there are issues regarding the jurisdiction under which the road falls. <Col N="407"/> However, this fact is being blatantly abused by reckless drivers who are performing stunts for the amusement of others, thereby endangering themselves and oncoming traffic.  It is particularly worrying given that this is the main road to Cavan, and to Cavan General Hospital, for many people in the area.  An alarming development in recent times is that a text message goes out to young people to say this is going to happen at a particular time, and they all congregate there for amusement.  It is a dangerous practice and it must be stopped before somebody is fatally injured.</P>
        <P>I welcome the recent measures announced with the aim of tackling the evasion of tolls and parking tickets by cross-Border drivers.  I commend the Minister on his ongoing work with his Northern colleagues on the establishment of a data exchange project that will allow authorities on both sides of the Border to pursue motorists who have not paid tolls or parking fines across the Border.  Why should they get away with it?  I am aware this is a pilot project but I look forward to its being operated on a permanent basis.  It must be pointed out that offending motorists were always obliged to pay the fines, but the difference is that now they can be pursued.  It is grossly unfair for those people who obey the law that others are evading payment.</P>
        <P>There is a need to continue to educate our young people in road safety and driving practice.  When a parent buys a bicycle for a small child, he or she makes sure the child has a helmet and keeps the stabilisers on until they are no longer needed.  A parent would not let a child out on the road unless he or she was present and it was safe to do so.  It is important that we ensure our young people are competent to go on the road before they are allowed to do so.  A car is a powerful and dangerous weapon and people, particularly young people, must be well educated in the rules of the road and the use of a car before they take to the road.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that many schools have introduced a road safety module as part of their transition year programmes.  I commend the teachers involved in delivering the programme, and the management of the schools on their vision and foresight in including this module.  Transition year should prepare young people for life outside school.  Driving will be a fact of life for almost everybody once they leave school, and they need to be educated and prepared for it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  We all have a duty as legislators and road users to do what we can to make our roads safer.  Drinking and driving cannot be condoned.  We must re-educate people, young and old.  Surprisingly, when one meets young people out socially, one finds that many of them would never dream of drinking and driving.  It is an alien concept to them.  They organise themselves to go out in groups, and people take it in turns to be the designated driver.  That is being responsible.  We need to continue to educate people about driving habits and attitudes to drinking and driving.  I am thankful that the concept of &ldquo;one for the road&rdquo; is not acceptable any more and that nobody would agree with it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the continuous ad campaigns encouraging people to be designated drivers or to exercise care on the roads.  Unfortunately, some of the advertisements are very distressing, particularly those showing the results of accidents.  It gets a very powerful message across and we must continue the good work to ensure we reduce fatalities on our road and make those who drive engage in best practice and be sensible in their driving habits.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  The reduction of the blood-alcohol concentration limit for drivers has considerably reduced the numbers of people killed on our roads.  It is fair to say that legislation which has reduced the blood-alcohol concentration limits has been generally successful.</P><Col N="408"/>
        <P>Irrespective of the legislation in place, if people are taking the chance, there must be more random breath testing.  Like all politicians, I do much travelling of the roads by day and especially by night, when the problem would be more acute.  It has been months since I was stopped on the road or saw a random police checkpoint.  Resources must be provided for garda&iacute; to have more random checkpoints.  That is the most effective way of ensuring that people will not abuse alcohol when driving.</P>
        <P>Garda statistics show that the numbers of such checkpoints have increased but visibility is very important.  If people are not reminded that there is random testing on a continuous basis, they may take a chance.  I agree with the previous speaker, Deputy Conlon, in that people are far more responsible now and there are very few people taking the chance of drinking and driving.  If people want to go out while driving, they would drink water or have a non-alcoholic drink.  Very few people indulge in alcohol &mdash; even one drink &mdash; if they are driving.  They do not want to take a chance because their lives and livelihoods, and those of others, are at stake if they drink too much.</P>
        <P>As a nation we have had different problems.  At times we had the problem of drinking and driving and there are other major problems, such as obesity.  This is one problem we have addressed to some extent.  Statistics have shown that under existing blood-alcohol concentration limits, 24% of fatal crashes have involved a driver above the legal limit.  Alcohol is still a factor but this legislation, supported by all parties in the House, will have an effect.</P>
        <P>There will also be an adverse effect on rural life.  Those of us living in rural constituencies are aware that the rural pub &mdash; the pub at the crossroads or a small village &mdash; is the local community centre.  It is where people congregate over the winter to play cards or partake in a quiz.  It is part of social life, and not just for people living on their own but everybody in a rural area.  The legislation will affect some people who drive.  There may be one car in the house and such people may live on their own or with families.  The reduced limits will have an effect and it is up to us as the providers of transport to act.</P>
        <P>Those who are in a position to provide rural transport, whether through public or private means, should be encouraged.  We will have to address this aspect of rural life more seriously because people who would normally drive to pubs but are rarely involved in accidents will not do so any more because of this Bill and the reduction in blood-alcohol concentration limits.  People may have taken the chance before of having two drinks but with this reduction, they will not take the chance even of going for one drink.</P>
        <P>The legislation will pose a difficulty and it is very important that the issue of rural isolation be seen as a problem.  There are other reasons to consider and we should try to facilitate the people who want to use their local public house as a community centre throughout the year but especially in the dark nights of winter, which can be very lonely and depressing for some living in rural areas.  A number of speakers have mentioned rural transport, which is something that must be addressed.  The point has been made fairly strongly.</P>
        <P>I have a serious concern about speeding.  A large percentage of accidents are speed-related.  I do not have the exact statistics and it may be very hard to prove that speed was the cause of an accident.  However, speeding must be addressed in a major way in this country.  Young people are very responsible in many cases with regard to driving and alcohol &mdash; they pool cars and take minibuses and so on &mdash; but they may not be as responsible when it comes to speed.  The concept of boy-racing and having souped-up cars and engines is popular and leads to accidents.  I have seen young people wiped out because of speed.</P><Col N="409"/>
        <P>I hope the speed cameras will be rolled out shortly and have an effect.  I understand that there could be up to 60 speed cameras around the country, although somebody mentioned they would only be operating for 6,000 hours, which is inadequate.  They should cover the country and make a bigger impact, so the time allocation should be greater.  Speed cameras will have a major impact when they are in operation.</P>
        <P>It is some time since the contract for the cameras was awarded, and I was delighted when it went to a company in Listowel.  That company beat off much international competition, which goes to show that a small company can have the competence for such contracts.  It has international partners in France and Australia but it showed that an Irish company can compete successfully on the international market to get a contract.  Will the Minister tell us the number of cameras involved, the time they will be in use and if there are any proposals to extend the length of time the cameras will be out there?</P>
        <P>In places like British Columbia, there was a major reaction when the cameras were rolled out first because people did not know about them and were being prosecuted.  It cost that government a term in office because people were so annoyed.</P>
        <P>It is extremely important that people should be informed when these cameras are going to be put in place.  They should be aware that such cameras can be placed in any location.  I accept that they will be installed in certain designated locations.  However, they must be also placed in random locations because, otherwise, people will drive at speed on the roads on which there are no cameras.  There should be a campaign on television and radio and in local newspapers to advertise the fact that these cameras are going to be in operation and to warn people that if they are caught speeding, there will be consequences.</P>
        <P>I accept that the installation of speed cameras will give rise to a great deal of inconvenience for everyone.  I recall Deputy Ring making the case that politicians who are obliged to attend four or five funerals on the same evening must speed from one place to another.  When these cameras are put in place, people will be obliged to become extremely disciplined in the context of how they drive.  However, if these cameras help to save one life their installation will have been worth it.  I am of the view that they will assist in saving many lives.</P>
        <P>Major difficulties are going to arise in the summer months as a result of the state of local roads.  Some 73% of all road deaths occur on local rural roads.  Great progress was made on improving our local road infrastructure during the past ten years.  Funding for upgrading these roads was increased by successive Administrations, including that in which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle served as Minister for the Environment.  I recall that he introduced a three-year programme which proved quite successful.  His work was continued by successive Governments and proved to be extremely effective.  I cycle a great deal on our roads and I am of the view that one could choose any road and indicate how it had been improved.</P>
        <P>Since the bad weather at Christmas, however, the surfaces on many roads have been destroyed.  I do not believe the roads, many of which are pitted with extremely deep potholes, have been ever in a more dangerous condition.  The reason our roads have been damaged to such an extent relates to a combination of high levels of rainfall followed by a number of very hard frosts.  The resultant freeze-thaw action meant that the surfaces on many roads simply cracked.  I accept that an issue may arise in the context of the composition of the material used on these roads.  In general, however, the surfaces on many good roads have just fallen apart.</P>
        <P>A major issue is going to arise in the context of fatalities and the number of crashes on the roads this summer.  Many tourism attractions are accessed by means of local roads such as those to which I refer.  Thankfully, it appears the number of tourists from America and other markets due to visit our shores this summer is set to increase.  Such tourists normally rent cars and drive <Col N="410"/>around the country.  There will be a problem in that regard this year because the number of self-drive cars available has dropped from 28,000 to 10,000.  However, there will be tourists driving on many of our local roads and they will have to be warned about the condition of those roads.</P>
        <P>Money has been allocated to local authorities in respect of upgrading, repairing and strengthening road surfaces.  If, however, other moneys can be found, they should be allocated in respect of the extensive repairs that must be carried out between now and June.  The programme of upgrading, repairing and strengthening road surfaces should be completed by July.  We must ensure that roads are made safe for local motorists as well as for the domestic and international tourists who will use them during the summer months.  I appeal to the Minister to give careful consideration to that matter.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation.  The House has taken an extremely responsible approach to this matter.  It would have been a populist move to oppose this Bill, particularly in light of the campaign organised by the Irish Vintners Federation, etc.  Those involved in that campaign put forward strong arguments but we are doing the responsible thing.  I hope this Bill represents just the first of a whole series of actions.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the other causes of car accidents.  In that context, people should not drive &mdash; neither should they be encouraged to do so &mdash; when they are tired.  Many of the accidents that happen &mdash; even those which occur in the middle of the day &mdash; are the result of people nodding off at the wheel.  This has happened to everyone at some point or another.  Politicians operate in a pressurised arena and they may sleep for only four or five hours at night.  As a result, they may be tired and in no condition to drive.  People should act responsibly.  If they feel tired while driving &mdash; either during the day or at night &mdash; they should pull over and take a nap.</P>
        <P>Another cause of accidents relates to drug driving.  Provision is made in the Bill to test drivers to discover whether they are under the influence of drugs.  A similar provision in the state of Victoria in Australia proved to be extremely effective.  Young people may not drink but they may take drugs.  Some of them may be of the view that because it is difficult to detect certain drugs they will not be caught.  It is important to get the message across to them that they will, in fact, be caught.</P>
        <P>It is vital that the Garda presence on the roads must be increased.  If the law is to be enforced in an effective manner, then more random tests must be carried out.  It goes without saying that there is a need to educate people and to engage in advertising campaigns.  The advertisements that have been broadcast on television in recent years have proven to be very effective.  I accept that some of them might be extremely disturbing but they certainly get across the message.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The level of signage in the areas around accident black spots should be increased.  Where roads are in bad condition and pitted with potholes, local authorities should erect signs warning people to slow down.  Whether they are electronic signs or just those of the ordinary kind, warning people to slow down because a road is in a dangerous condition can be of assistance.  Due to the way in which certain roads were repaired over the years, some stretches may have been strengthened while others might be still in a perilous state.  As a result, one can find oneself on a bad stretch before one knows it.  Proper signage is, therefore, extremely important because it can prevent serious accidents.  Some drivers who have come off a bad stretch of road often flash their headlights in warning at those travelling in the opposite direction.  If people slow down, the likelihood of their having accidents on bad stretches of road certainly will be reduced.</P><Col N="411"/>
        <P>I will end on a sober note.  It is estimated that the cost of each death on our roads is approximately &euro;2.2 million.  In that context, the total cost relating to fatalities on our roads last year was &euro;613.8 million.  The more we can reduce the number of fatalities, the less grief families will experience.  In addition, a great deal of money will be saved.</P>

	<P>I oppose the main provisions and the detail of this Bill.  The Minister has been driven around for far too long and he no longer has his feet on the ground.  I hope he has retained his driving licence because he is going to need it before long.  The sooner he requires it, the better it will be as far as I am concerned.  I remind the Minister that there are now 22 ex-Ministers supporting the Government.  I am not here to represent the publicans or drink-drivers but to represent common sense and to be the voice for my constituents in Cork South-West to oppose the Government&rsquo;s usual policy of reaching the lowest common denominator.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="5" />
        <P>The Minister is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut in this case by reducing the permitted blood alcohol from 80 mg to 50 mg and further to 20 mg in some cases.  The Minister is going further than what safety organisations of world renown have sought.  He is claiming this as a major road safety issue but the statistics produced by the HSE do not support him.  A HSE study of road deaths in the period from 2003 to 2005 produced figures which showed that in accidents involving road deaths 165 drivers had consumed no alcohol whatsoever; 18 drivers were between 50 mg and 80 mg; and 103 drivers were between 80 mg and 160 mg.</P>
        <P>We are bringing forward this legislation because of the behaviour of an average of six drivers a year.  Moreover, the HSE reported that 65% of all road deaths between 1990 and 2006 were unrelated to alcohol, and we have no knowledge of the other factors involved in these road deaths.  We have no knowledge of the driver&rsquo;s age or experience; the type of vehicle of the driver; the weather conditions at the time; whether the deaths happened during daylight hours or in darkness at night; whether the road was wet or dry; or even which month it was.  How can we make these new laws with such a dearth of information?</P>
        <P>The Minister thinks he knows best and because he has the numbers in this House he thinks he can bulldoze the Bill through.  However, the Minister must prove his case and I have a few questions I hope he will address.  I am sorry he is not here but the Minister of State will convey them to him.  While most of Europe may have reduced to the proposed limit most of the English speaking world, that is the UK, the USA and Canada, and ourselves up to now have not reduced the present limit.  Might I also state that most of the beer drinking world has a limit of 80 mg while the majority of wine consuming nations have chosen to reduce the limit to 50 mg?  This might be due to daytime drinking among the wine nations of Europe which may continue into the evening as opposed to countries which have more of a habit of night-time drinking.  If the Minister&rsquo;s primary intention is the reduction of road deaths and injuries then there are a number of other actions he could have taken prior to introducing this rushed and ill-considered legislation a year before he can provide for its enforcement.  I ask the Minister to withdraw the Bill until he can provide for its implementation.</P>
        <P>Why has he not rolled out the speed cameras which for years have been provided for in legislation?  Is it another case of premature legislation?  Why has he not rolled out the full penalty points scheme?  Why has he not brought forward legislation forcing cars to have their dipped headlights on at all times, or at least, as in the practice in some parts of the United States, that if one&rsquo;s wipers are on then at least one&rsquo;s dipped headlights must also be on?</P>
        <P>I was intrigued to read the recent audit of local authorities which mentioned water wastage, staff absenteeism and other issues but made no mention whatsoever of road safety measures or the role of local authorities in providing safer roads and the removal of well-known accident <Col N="412"/>black spots.  Where is the joined up thinking?  Do I need to mention the Slane Bridge which has cost many more lives that this measure will ever save?</P>
        <P>The National Roads Authority report for 2009 issued last week claimed that 373 road safety remedial schemes which have been completed showed an overall reduction of 97 fatal collisions, 73 serious collisions, and 253 minor injury collisions.  This means that for 373 improvements we have a reduction of 423 collisions.  I could mention 500 locations in my constituency that could benefit from such works.  If the Minister really wanted to save lives he would be putting his efforts into these schemes rather than going for the quick cheap solution.  This legislation will not remove one of these black spots.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also wish to discuss the comments by Garda Chief Superintendent Gabriel McIntyre of the Garda traffic corps who stated that an average of almost five people have lost their lives on the State&rsquo;s roads on every October bank holiday weekend over the past nine years.  Last year, Chief Superintendent McIntyre stated a predicted sudden end to a warm spell, switching to wet roads and early morning mist or fog could have lethal consequences for unprepared drivers.  He appealed to drivers to be especially vigilant when the clocks went back that Sunday, as it would get darker earlier in the evening.  Over the past nine years, 43 people lost their lives on roads during the October bank holiday weekend and almost one third of them were vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists.  As that is approximately the same number that this legislation is supposed to protect, why do we not we abolish the October bank holiday?  It would make as much sense as this legislation because it does not take into account the other factors which Chief Superintendent outlined.</P>
              <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>What is the Minister doing to improve road safety over the October bank holiday weekend?  Is the Minister aware that according to latest Hibernian Aviva safety report on motor accidents involving its clients that December is the most dangerous month of the year and December 20 is the most dangerous day, with 223 accidents reported to the company on that day?  Does the Minister know that 92% of pedestrians involved in accidents between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. were intoxicated?  The fact that this period covers the darkest wettest days of the year and that the peak accident date for many years coincides with the shortest day of the year is not a statistic that can be ignored.  What is the Minister doing to improve road safety during the month of December?  For many years, we have had more Garda checkpoints during the month of December than the rest of the year put together but we still have more accidents in December.  Will the Minister tell me that his policies up to now are working?  That more accidents happen on one of the shortest days of the year has to be examined in greater detail.  Will the Minister consider, in the interests of road safety, that we move to central European time so that we can have an extra hour of daylight every evening of the winter from October to the end of March?  This measure would be welcomed by everyone in the country and would probably save ten times more lives than the Bill would ever claim to do.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I was intrigued when <i>SuperFreakonomics</i> received publicity for its claim that statistics proved one would be safer driving home drunk than walking home drunk.  However, we now have Irish statistics that 92% of pedestrians involved in accidents between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. were intoxicated.  This is an alarming statistic.  This Bill will drive more pedestrians on to dark unlit country roads with no footpaths in the middle of the night.  Has the Minister considered that this Bill may actually kill more people in my constituency of Cork South-West than the lives he claims it might save?  Do I need to mention the absence of dual carriageways in my constituency and not a single kilometre, not even a metre, of motorway?  Does the Minister know the effect this legislation will have on a constituency like Cork South-West, which is full of dark country roads with no public lighting and which lacks public transport of any description?</P><Col N="413"/>
        <P>The Minister might be too young to remember the legal notion of a bona fide house, in that those who had travelled more than three miles had the right to purchase drink until a later hour.  This legal principle was abolished by the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1960, which was long before I entered this House.  Perhaps this notion should be revisited and the principle reversed by allowing those travelling less than three miles to be permitted a higher blood alcohol level than those travelling more that three miles from their homes.  The Minister has indicated that all the breathalyser machines in the country will require replacement and I ask that the replacements be digitally calibrated to show motorists the exact reading when they are tested to ascertain whether they have consumed alcohol.  At present, breathalysers will give a zero, pass or fail result but not the reading itself.</P>
        <P>I will give the example of two Members of this House who consumed similar amounts of alcohol according to themselves.  However, one was fractionally over, while the other was fractionally under, the limit.  If the Minister wishes to educate drivers, he must play fair.  In the aforementioned two cases, analysis of the samples revealed that one was over and the other was under the limit although the same amount of drink was consumed.  The Minister also should inform the House as to the exact level to which breathalysers are set at present and what degree of tolerance is allowed.  In addition, the Minister also should state the percentage of persons who, having failed the breathalyser test, were found to be under the limit when their sample was examined at the Garda station or by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.</P>
        <P>I wish to take up the issue that taxpayers&rsquo; moneys are being used for propaganda.  The Government for years has spent taxpayers&rsquo; moneys on trying to curtail consumption of alcohol and tobacco.  In another example of the Government throwing away the taxpayers&rsquo; money, these sums have been wasted as this direct objective has not led to a reduction by a single iota of a single percentage point in the consumption of alcohol or tobacco.  The most recent surveys have shown a significant increase in tobacco and alcohol consumption in Ireland.  I stated that this constituted propaganda, which I believe to be the case in that it is being used to allow the Government to remove resistance, even among its backbenchers, to even more restrictive legislation on every occasion it wishes.  I wonder what would be the Supreme Court&rsquo;s verdict, were a case put before it on similar grounds to those stated in the McKenna judgment that restricted the Government&rsquo;s ability to use public money to advocate its own case in referendums.</P>
        <P>While the present advertisement for one of the road safety bodies states that one can never drink and drive, I know of no law that allows for a zero level of alcohol.  Does this not constitute another example of propaganda softening up public opinion before lowering the limit from 80 mg to 50 mg?  Is this the reason the mighty mouths on the other side of the House now appear to be punch drunk and are quietly supporting this Bill while assuring their publican friends that they would oppose it to the hilt?  I also advise the Minister to proceed with caution on this issue.  I am aware of at least three cases in which a judge, who had heard cases involving drink-driving, had his rulings appealed on the basis of the legality of his appointment.  The appellant won and the judge retired.  I am not aware that such steps have been taken by those convicted of murder or any other crime.</P>
        <P>According to the Drinkaware website in the United Kingdom, as many as 33,000 people there die from alcohol-related causes each year, which is ten times the number of people who die on their roads annually.  I presume a similar ratio would apply here.  Where is the Government&rsquo;s policy on education of alcohol abuse that kills ten times more people than are killed on our roads, drunk or sober?  The Minister has caused massive confusion throughout the driving public by creating the term, &ldquo;professional driver&rdquo;.  While this does not exist in law, the Minister has tried to legislate for it by specifying certain categories of driving licences.  However, life is <Col N="414"/>more complicated than that.  To which limit is a driver who is driving his company van home from Mass on a Sunday morning to be tested?</P>
        <P>I now wish to consider the detail of this Bill, in which the Minister has proposed a new lower limit of 20 mg for first-time drivers, as well as taxi and other professional drivers.  I presume, having carried out extensive research before introducing this Bill before the House, the Minister for Transport is aware that the limit he proposes of 20 mg is half that set for airline pilots carrying 300 passengers across the Atlantic in a &euro;40 million aircraft.  The Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, sets a limit of 40 mg.  In other words, the Minister is setting a limit that is half that for a pilot flying a commercial jet with 300 passengers across the Atlantic trying to land on a runway one quarter the width of his or her aircraft at 180 mph.  Has the Minister gone off the rails completely, is his head in the clouds or is he lost at sea?  Under the FAA&rsquo;s rules for pilots, Federal Aviation Regulation 91.17, which deals with alcohol and drugs, states &ldquo;no person may act or attempt to act as a crewmember of a civil aircraft ... While having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater in a blood or breath specimen&rdquo;.  Given his lack of research, the Minister should outline how he knows so much better than a body such as the FAA.  It is the largest safety organisation in the world with a budget of $9,336 million, which is approximately 160 times what the Minister wasted on another item of premature legislation, namely, electronic voting.  This safety organisation is charged with the safe transit in the air of more than 4.5 million passengers every day.  This organisation&rsquo;s mission statement states its mission is to provide the safest and most efficient aerospace system in the world.  However, this Minister knows better, albeit with very little research and a head bigger than a balloon full of hot air.  Can the Minister explain the reason drivers who drive home bingo buses and who can barely go above 40 km/h because of the potholes in the nation&rsquo;s county roads must adhere to restrictions twice the standard of the commercial pilot flying overhead with hundreds of lives in his control?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">According to experts, many factors make up the alcohol concentration in a blood, breath or urine sample such as one&rsquo;s weight or gender as men tend to process alcohol faster than women.  Similarly, it can be affected by one&rsquo;s metabolism, current stress levels, whether one has eaten recently or one&rsquo;s age as younger people tend to process alcohol more slowly.  This varies from person to person.  I note that one of the aforementioned factors is that younger people tend to process alcohol slower.  Consequently, as most of those in the first two years of their driving licence will be younger people, the Minister will be doling out a double whammy to them.  Moreover, I am told that in the scientific world, 0.02% is the lowest possible limit that it is possible to accurately determine and some even question the accuracy of measurements at this level.</P>
        <P>When travellers set off a metal detector, they are not arrested and convicted of gun smuggling or terrorism.  While everyone with a gun will set off the metal detector, most people who set off the metal detector do not have a gun.  The Minister must understand that not everyone who has had a drink is going to have an accident or injury or kill someone.  The Minister should try to discover other more accurate methods of accident prevention, rather than punishing everyone for the sins of a few.  The Minister is racing to the lowest common denominator again.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not a great demand on the part of Members to speak.  If a juggernaut ran into a school playground and caused ten fatalities, one would not ban jugger<Col N="415"/>nauts because doing so would not make any sense.  However, is this not what the irrational Green Party Government is doing because a deer ran into a school playground?  In lowering the alcohol limits, the Minister is using the same principle but not taking all the other factors into account.  He is using some statistics to back up a flawed case.  The sure way to deter drink-driving is to increase enforcement, not lower the blood alcohol limit.</P>
        <P>If the Minister is telling the House that a driver who provides a sample of 0.021g is more dangerous than the airline pilot overhead with 300 passengers who is legally permitted a sample of 0.039g, it is time for common sense and I urge him to withdraw the Bill.  I want him to tear it up as I now propose to do or rewrite it with common sense in mind.  If he wants to lower the limits, then he should lower them to 50mg for new drivers and professional drivers, just above the limit set for an airline pilot, and leave the current limit as it is at 80mg for all other drivers.  To cite someone else, it is time to get out his peann luaidhe and everywhere in this Bill he sees see &ldquo;50&rdquo;, he should cross it out and make it &ldquo;80&rdquo;, and everywhere he sees &ldquo;20&rdquo;, he should cross it out and make it &ldquo;50&rdquo;.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the fact that some would try to portray the Bill as being the panacea for road accidents and road fatalities, I must disagree with some of my colleague&rsquo;s points.  The Bill is part of a larger picture that must be seen in the context of what it can or cannot achieve.  For the record, it is important that I lay out the purposes of the Road Traffic Bill.  It provides for the reduction of the blood alcohol limit from 80mg to 20mg in respect of professional drivers and to 50mg in respect of all other drivers.  It revises the associated penalties, including driver disqualification.  It provides for the mandatory alcohol testing of all drivers of mechanically propelled vehicles involved in road collisions.  It clarifies the minimum disqualification period that must be served before a driver may apply to the courts for restoration of his or her licence.  It provides powers to assist garda&iacute; in a crucial matter, namely, forming an opinion as to whether a driver is under the influence of an intoxicant, be it drink, drugs or a combination thereof, and allow them to carry out preliminary tests like coherency tests, etc.  It consolidates and restates the provisions of previous Road Traffic Acts on intoxicated drivers and amends certain fixed charges and other minor issues.</P>
        <P>Road safety comprises three main points, the first being better detection and enforcement of rules.  This relates to speeding, alcohol excess, drug excess and general road manners and the enforcement of proper driving, pedestrian and cyclist codes.  As many Deputies have mentioned, particularly those from outside urban areas, it is important that we provide road users with suitable alternatives.  On the one hand, taxi drivers complain that there are too many taxis <Col N="416"/>in this and other cities while, on the other, there is a dearth of alternatives to the car in many isolated areas, villages and smaller towns.</P>
        <P>The third point is the provision of safe roads.  When one delves into the statistics, accident black spots are undoubtedly not accident black spots purely because people who have drunk an excessive amount of alcohol decide to drive on them.  Generally speaking, it is down to a combination of factors.  Black spots are dangerous by their nature.  They are located in isolated areas and tend to be at the end of faster, better roads.  County Donegal&rsquo;s black spots have been well documented.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle presumably knows from commuting to Leinster House for a long number of years, work on sections of the N11 in County Wicklow from the Beehive to Jack White&rsquo;s Cross, as it is called, was put on the long finger several times by the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s predecessor, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Martin Cullen, when other roads saw fruition.  One part of the N11 only opened yesterday.</P>
        <P>All of these issues are relevant in our discussion on reducing the number of road accidents.  Everyone is aware of the devastation caused by drink-driving.  It is important to state that ours is not a country in which people developed overnight a love of going to the pub.  In rural areas, it is ironic that one used to be required to live at least three miles from a pub to get a drink after hours.  I could never understand the logic of this.  It was before I was of an age at which I was allowed to drink.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It was to allow one to build up a thirst.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>If one had been required to eat food as well, as was the case with discos, it would have made sense, but this law was applied for some reason.  This shows how far our mindset has needed to come to return to the point at which we do not drink and drive.  I have two sons younger than 21 years of age who have full licences.  They would not dream of going out unless some member of their group was not drinking.  Otherwise, they would hire a taxi.  This is how far we have come.  Mine are not perfect children, but they are typical of their cohort, although there are notable exceptions.</P>
        <P>We must consider other factors.  There are cars with &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; signs on lay-bys that show contact numbers for racing clubs or whatever they are called.  Convoys of these drivers travel up our national routes seeking beach areas or large public car parks in which to perform their doughnuts and so on, normally under the cover of darkness.  They have probably not consumed any alcohol, although they may have consumed other intoxicants.  Their groups are led by peer pressure.  In the legislation of some American states, a clause states that one can only drive between the hours of sunset and morning with a member of one&rsquo;s family and no one else.  One cannot bring a buddy or girlfriend on whom one wants to make a big impression.  Even without the &ldquo;assistance&rdquo;, if one wants to call it that, of alcohol, people get led into doing things they would otherwise not do.</P>
        <P>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan touched on a matter.  Goodbody&rsquo;s has estimated that the cost of road deaths and serious injuries between 1990 and 2006 was &euro;14.9 billion.  It is an horrendous figure.  No life can be measured in terms of cost and an event which causes devastation to a family cannot be assessed in monetary terms.  Nevertheless, &euro;14.9 billion is a huge cost for a country of 4 million people to bear.  Anything we can do to improve matters must be considered.</P>
        <P>We must try to be responsible.  We cannot ignore the fact that alcohol is a factor in road accidents.  I do not think we can quantify the numbers of people with a blood alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg who have been involved in or caused serious road accidents. Some <Col N="417"/>of the provisions in the Bill which allow for mandatory testing will determine that.  The Bill, if it is enacted, will allow us to determine it more accurately.  We may have a more reasoned and sane debate on this issue when the Bill had been applied and properly enforced.</P>
        <P>Reference has been made to the number of hours spent on traffic monitoring and to the use of speed cameras and testing.  Any effort to reduce the number of road deaths is worthwhile.  Awareness campaigns, improvements to roads, the identification of accident black spots will all contribute to that reduction.  When we have taken the measures provided in the Bill we should assess their effectiveness.  I do not think its effects will be as bad as some predict or as good as others claim.  It gives us a chance to make things better and improve conditions.</P>
        <P>Most people drink alcohol when socialising.  The effective implementation of drink-driving measures has reduced the number of people socialising in public houses at night.  It is also said that greater enforcement of licensing hours and the ban on smoking in pubs have contributed to this decline.  It is not a coincidence that this reduction has taken place at a time when Monday morning absenteeism has become unacceptable.  Sunday evening from 6 p.m. to closing time used to be the busiest night in rural pubs.  Saturday night is now the busiest night of the week.  Others go to public houses to watch sport on television and do not drink much.  This has all contributed to a decline in drinking.  Between 2007 and 2009 in County Wicklow, 17 public house licences were not renewed.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding all of that, we must consider the issue of isolation.  We must strengthen the rural partnership transport scheme.  I compliment the outgoing Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, who, despite coming from an urban constituency, saw the value of the scheme and made efforts to restore it.  However, it must be developed further rather than reduced or curtailed.</P>
        <P>Damaged roads and accident black spots must be dealt with.  A good driving and pedestrian environment must be provided.  Many developments on the edges of town have not been completed, footpaths and public lighting have not been provided and speed limits have not been reviewed.  I was in west Cork last weekend on my way to a certain function in Killarney.  I saw a road in Clondrohid which leads to the birthplace of Bishop Felim O&rsquo;Shea.  Deputy Sheehan knows the road well.  It is dirt track on which one could hardly ride a bicycle yet it has a speed limit of 80 km/h.  I took a photograph because it is so ridiculous.</P>

	<P>One would need the stomach of a steeplechase jockey to survive on the road yet one is within one&rsquo;s rights to drive on it at 80 km/h.  The 30 km/h and 50 km/h zones must also be reviewed.  When we changed from miles to kilometres per hour we had an opportunity to look at this matter but we did not take it.  We should not close our minds to the possibility of speed limits of 45 km/h and 79 km/h.  This would give speed limits which are realistically enforceable and sensible.  Likewise, there are roads which have an 80 km/h limit where one could not possibly drive near that speed.  I accept that speed limits are a maximum but many people see them as the acceptable, almost compulsory, driving speed.</P>
        <P>I have referred to accident black spots on the N11.  Weather conditions after Christmas left many roads in a seriously diminished state.  I have informed the Minister for Transport about an area of south Wicklow, north Wexford and north-east Carlow where roads have been devastated by weather damage.  School buses are no longer prepared to collect children on some roads which have become totally impassable.  Other roads are less damaged but have been seriously undermined by potholes and poor surfaces which cannot be seen in wet weather or <Col N="418"/>in the dark.  Neglect of these roads will cause accidents.  I ask the Minister to send officials of his Department to examine these roads.  The director of roads in Wicklow estimates that it will cost &euro;14 million to restore roads damaged by winter weather.  The annual allocation for all road works in County Wicklow is just over &euro;9 million, which is a 32% reduction on the previous allocation.  This fund was only introduced in 2009.  We must invest in road repairs to make driving conditions safer.  This will save money in the long run.  It will also provide work.  Several companies employed people in road building and this work is no longer available.  Well maintained roads will prevent the deterioration of cars and make them safer.  I have seen owners of brand new cars having to replace entire wheels because of damage from poor road surfaces.  Under-carriages, brakes and lights are all challenged by poor road conditions.</P>
        <P>The Medical Bureau of Road Safety surveyed 1,000 drivers who were over the legal alcohol limit and 1,000 who were under the limit.  Of the 1,000 drivers under the alcohol limit, 331 had taken drugs compared with 142 of the 1,000 who were over the limit.  More than twice as many of those who were under the legal blood alcohol level of 80 mg had consumed some form of drug.  Some 48.7% of the drivers under the legal alcohol limit were under the age of 25 and more than 90% were male.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a serious issue.  We have to address the issue of people who drive under the influence of drugs.  In terms of the 50 mg blood-alcohol level, the provision in the Bill that allows a garda to form an opinion and carry out a preliminary test is vital.  Alongside that measure, a road safety awareness and continuing education programme is needed.  The Road Safety Authority does a wonderful job in raising road safety awareness.  Its television campaign is graphic and is in one&rsquo;s face.  The awareness campaign is broadcast on the radio and I urge that it be highlighted in clubs and in areas where people congregate.  When one is having one&rsquo;s tea at 6 p.m. one might think of going for a drink but it is not the time when <Col N="419"/>having a drink is uppermost on one&rsquo;s mind.  It would be worthwhile to highlight the campaign in those areas.  To quote the slogan used by another organisation, every little helps.  We should persist with such awareness campaigns.  The provisions of the Bill when implemented should be reassessed in a year or 18 months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>If the arrangement is agreeable to Deputy Tom Hayes, I will share this 20 minute time slot with him and have 10 minutes each.</P>
        <P>In welcoming the opportunity to contribute to this Bill, I recognise the tenacity of the Minister in the efforts he has made to bring this Bill before the House.  He has certainly fought a battle at his own end and I recognise his efforts.  He and I remonstrated through the early stages of this Bill internally about aspects of it.  While I might not have agreed with certain elements of it, I recognise his bona fides in that regard and the tremendous tenacity he has brought to bear in ensuring that this Bill passes through this House.</P>
        <P>It must be recognised that the approach by the Road Safety Authority, the Government and all sensible politicians has led to a dramatic improvement in our road safety.  There are a number of factors involved, policy is one of them, policy in a number of areas not only on road safety but on the improvement of road surfaces and the quality of our roads.  Another factor is the sensible approach that has been taken by many motorists and people within the education sector who have sought to bring about a change in culture in terms of what is acceptable and what is not.  We have done that in regard to drink-driving.  We still need to do that in regard to driving at speed.  I have some issues on that, which I addressed recently.</P>
        <P>It is clearly vital that we continue with that process of education and of culture change.  The younger cohort in society are no longer prepared to drink and drive as young people did in the past.  They are much more focused on ensuring there is a designated driver, that they use public transport or the service of a taxi or others.  That is the way forward.</P>
        <P>In recognising the huge achievements that have been made, we must be careful in terms of adhering to a belief that we could not fall back or return to the bad old days.  While the improvements in the reduction in the number of road deaths have been brought about by good policy and a determined approach to highlight the issue, we should recognise that fewer people are consuming alcohol and there is less activity in the economy because of the recession.  The reduction in the number of people killed on our roads is in some way attributable to the recession.  Therefore, we should not allow ourselves to fall into a false sense of security and belief that we now have a model that is wholesome and ensures that we will continue on the downward spiral in terms of the reduction in the number of road deaths.  We will have to continue to check that.  I agree with what Deputy Doyle said that we will need to address this issue at a later stage.  It must be addressed on an ongoing basis.  It is no different from anything else in life &mdash; if one allows something to go off the agenda, one tends to become complacent.</P>
        <P>I must compliment RTE on the approach it has taken to the reporting of deaths on our roads.  During our more difficult years it introduced a news segment at the end of each month, which Charlie Bird was responsible for reporting prior to his departure to the United States.  Now that he is returning, that segment might be reintroduced.  It was a rolling report lasting a few minutes that identified individuals who had died on our roads, their family circumstances, age and personal details.  It was a shocking portrayal of road deaths at the end of each month.  This segment was reported at a time when 30 to 32 people were being killed on our roads.  It was a striking image.  It certainly had an impact on me as I am sure it had on many other people.  It is that type of continuous identification of the scourge of death on our roads that helps to change the culture, to remind people of the scourge it is and helps to ensure that all <Col N="420"/>our behaviour is altered and improved in a way that continues to work towards the reduction of death on our roads.</P>
        <P>Deputy Doyle raised an issue, which motivated me in my opposition to some elements of the Bill, particularly the reduction of the blood alcohol level from 80 mg to 50 mg.  The Minister&rsquo;s mitigation that a first offence would be addressed through the fixed penalty was a good compromise and I recognise and welcome his move in that regard.</P>
        <P>The isolation debate in rural Ireland in vitally important.  For an individual living alone in a rural area, having a few pints is a very important part of his or her life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>We must accept that is still an issue and we have to find a way to address that.  The rural transport initiative, to which the Minister responded favourably by ensuring that the McCarthy report did not eliminate it, could be and should be expanded in that regard.  We must be mindful of that.  Some people have sought to use, overuse or abuse the case of the person isolated in a rural area by way of trying to work against the introduction of sensible levels of alcohol tolerance and the use of alcohol as a recreational element in life to the detriment of others.  It is an important issue but in some cases it has been utilised by others as a front for not changing the <i>status quo</i> and that was unfair.  It is a huge issue that is vitally important but it can be overstated for the wrong reason.  That is not to undermine the importance of the issue.  We have to work with the Government, stakeholders, publicans, liquor licensing trade and the breweries to ensure there is an adequate and appropriate level of transportation to get people home.  It is not beyond the realms of possibility to be able to put that in place to ensure that the environment is much safer for all concerned.  There is that gap in the middle as we try to work towards it.</P>

        <P>I recognise the tremendous efforts that have been made and that we cannot sit on our laurels.  We cannot allow ourselves to believe that we have this problem or scourge solved.  It must continue to be addressed whether by legislation, statement or highlighting within the media.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on what is the most important Bill to come before the House.  It is not often that I praise Ministers but the Minister present has had a very strong view on this issue and on what needs to be done.  He has held steadfastly to his view in stark contrast to the backbenchers on his side of the House who have been vocal on this issue on every television and radio station for the past few months. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a slight degree of cowardice in the way they have behaved.  They said they were going to oppose and stop this legislation.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P>Where are they tonight?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Where are they are?   Alas, we are here discussing this Bill.  When a Bill is introduced that will affect people&rsquo;s lives, in terms of road safety in this instance, it is <Col N="421"/>important that sufficient time is allocated for consideration of the addressing of the many issues involved.  </P>
        <P>The biggest issue in regard to rural Ireland is the decrease in the number of people going to pubs and this has raised great concern that jobs will be lost.  This is a legitimate concern throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Deputy Dooley raised the issue of loneliness, which is a problem.  However, having reached a point where people accept that drink-driving is dangerous, we must introduce alternatives which will protect rural areas and help address rural isolation.  Some years ago, we were able to have one or two drinks before driving home.  This is now illegal, however, and one must abide by the law.  The Minister should examine how transport can be provided at night for older people and others who wish to have one or two drinks, meet neighbours or have a game of cards in their local pub.  These people need a safe means of travelling home.</P>
        <P>Ireland has experienced a rapid cultural change in recent years.  People now drink more at home and young people buy vast amounts of imported alcohol to drink at home.  This change in culture has not been good.  The Government must give serious consideration to finding alternative forms of transport for those in rural areas who wish to visit their local pub.  A simple solution would be to provide a tax concession to pub owners who wish to operate a small minibus which would bring seven or eight customers home.  Such a measure would change the culture in rural areas.  I have observed one or two examples of this practice which is effective.  We must protect those, whether young or old, who wish to have a few drinks and a chat in their local pub.  The pub adds to the quality of life in Ireland and enables tourists to enjoy a song and dance.  We are, however, fast losing this great culture.  I ask the Minister to address this issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister has strong views on what needs to be done.  I have no doubt that when the legislation is enacted, it will affect the rural quality of life many of us want to maintain.  One hears a great deal about job creation, the poor state of the economy and the need to pull together.  There is a strong case, however, for taking action to protect the quality of life in rural areas.</P>
        <P>Many issues arise in the area of road safety, of which the quality of roads is an important one.  It takes a long time to have a bend removed from a country road as there are few means of doing so.  Given the large number of farmers involved in the REP scheme, I ask the Minister to ensure his Department co-operates with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to have dangerous bends removed and improve sight distance on roads, for example, by cutting back hedgerows.  Co-operation between the Departments would save lives and substantial sums of money.  Accidents can occur easily at bends because drivers cannot see large oncoming trucks or drivers travelling at excessive speeds.</P>
        <P>It is vital to educate young drivers.  As a father of three young men who drive, I am acutely aware of parents&rsquo; concerns about young people driving cars at night.  It is a real worry to have a child who drives a high powered vehicle.  Although we knock young people at times, I commend them on choosing not to drink and drive and for sharing cars and bringing friends home.  Young people aged 17 or 18 years should receive better driver training, including as part of the transition year programme.  They must be educated on the dangers of high powered motor vehicles because many of them do not understand the dangers involved.  There is significant scope for providing driver training in transition year and helping young people to become aware of the dangers on our roads.</P>
        <P>On speed cameras, I, like every other public representative, travel extensively by road.  While I note that drivers are much more aware of speed limits and are less likely to race, one still <Col N="422"/>finds the odd lunatic who will overtake at high speed even when one is driving at the speed limit.  Speed cameras are needed to catch and control these fellows, most of whom drive cars which have two protruding exhausts and produce noise levels that would frighten the life out of anybody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P>Their cars are jet propelled. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>At times one would believe they are jet propelled.  Speed cameras need to be installed to catch these drivers. </P>
        <P>I recall that efforts were to be made to provide flashing lights outside all rural schools.  This has not been done.  Flashing lights are highly effective and should be provided outside every school.</P>
        <P>The issues I raise are very important and a cause of genuine concern to me.  Rural publicans must be protected and the Department should co-operate with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to ensure minor, inexpensive improvements are made to our roads to make them much safer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Dooley and Deputies opposite for their co-operation.  I am grateful to all 34 Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage debate.  The large number of contributions demonstrates the level of interest in this issue.</P>
        <P>I also acknowledge the constructive approach most Deputies have taken to the debate.  While the legislation has aroused passions on both sides of the argument, I respect the position adopted by some speakers who believe the Bill is not a priority in the greater scheme of things and I should have focused my attention elsewhere.  However, when one decides to change blood alcohol content limits, one is told that speed is the problem on the roads and when one decides to change speed limits, one is told the condition of the roads or other factors are the problem.  The truth is one cannot solve the problem or reduce deaths and injuries on the roads by a single set of measures.  This fact was highlighted repeatedly by Deputies on all sides during the debate.</P>
        <P>The Bill acts as something of a book end for the 1994 Road Traffic Act and subsequent legislation.  In the period since the 1994 Act entered into force, road deaths have declined by more than 40%.  Every piece of legislation in between has been, one might say, a separate chapter in the history, has contributed and been instrumental in reducing injuries and deaths.  I wish to acknowledge and recognise, as I did earlier during Question Time, that this is one area of business we do in the House for which there is broad cross-party support, co-operation and a very constructive approach.  The legislation we have had as a result is top quality.  I wish to assure Members of the House on the Opposition benches and my own party backbenchers that I look forward to Committee Stage and to listening again to any suggestions they may have that will improve the Bill.</P>
        <P>No matter what Deputies may say there is no doubt that having any level of alcohol in one&rsquo;s blood diminishes one&rsquo;s ability to drive.  The more one drinks the less able one is to drive.  That is why over a period we have reduced the level and propose to reduce it further.  Some Deputies have asked why we do not go the whole way and have a zero blood alcohol limit but everybody knows the difficulty involved.  The drink driving laws are the most litigated pieces of legislation on the books.  Trying to get to a zero limit with all the caveats involved, such as medicines and so on, as raised by Deputies, is not practical.  However, even though such a measure might not find favour anywhere else in the House I believe we should arrive at a stage where anybody <Col N="423"/>who takes any amount of drink should not drive.  I am happy that this is a step in the right direction.</P>
        <P>I dealt with the matter of the introduction of the measure during Question Time and shall not return to it in any detail.  However, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is powering ahead with the provision and trying to get the new evidential breath testing, EBT, machines in place.  It will have the tendering process complete by the middle of the year and will test the machines over the following six months which will bring us to the end of the year.  Over the next six to eight months the MBRS will roll these out to Garda stations.  Extra stations, beyond the 64 involved at present, and more garda&iacute; will be trained.  Within that kind of timeframe everything will be in place for testing.  As Members know, this Bill contains a number of different areas that deal with commencement notices and this is one such.  We will commence at that stage.</P>
        <P>I reiterate we are conscious of the issue of drugs and driving.  I am very conscious that drugs, equally alcohol, can and do affect a person&rsquo;s driving.  We are making a move towards introducing impairment tests and the forming of opinion on impairment by garda&iacute;, which is the initial step in that regard.  The next piece of road traffic legislation will go much further with regard to drugs and driving.  We hope that by the time it is introduced we will have succeeded at EU level in producing kits that will be able to test by the roadside.  One way or another, the provisions contained will strengthen the detection of drugs and subsequent action in that regard.  We intend to make this even more explicit in future legislation.</P>
        <P>Deputy Broughan referred to the mutual recognition of penalty points and questioned the level of progress being made at EU level.  There are no specific directives in our proposals to provide for such arrangements between EU countries.  It is widely recognised that because of the various technical, legislative and logistic issues associated with that kind of arrangement it would be hugely complex.  However, we will support the development of co-operative arrangements with relevant authorities across Europe and will try to advance same between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  The experience gained from the operation of the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications, which we introduced on 28 January, will be of benefit to us as we move this issue forward.</P>
        <P>The evasion of penalty points through a lack of robust procedures was highlighted during the debate.  Again, this is being tackled in the legislation.  The new provision under Part 5 of the Bill will assist further with administrative procedures in the courts and the application of penalty points to the appropriate driver licence.  Section 51 establishes a requirement to produce both a driver licence and a copy of the licence to the District Court clerk.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd raised a question concerning section 6 and the endorsement of three penalty points on payment of a fixed penalty notice for a first-time drinking offence within specific blood alcohol concentration levels.  That option is available only once in a five-year period so for any further offence, irrespective of the detected BAC level, there will be a disqualification.  We have adopted what is almost a yellow card approach for a first offence but subsequently the full rigours of the law will follow.  I believe that is a reasonable approach at this stage.</P>
        <P>Regarding graduated driving licences, the Road Safety Authority has had a consultation period and recently submitted recommendations in that regard.  I shall consider those as soon as this Bill passes through the House.</P>
        <P>I am agnostic in many respects regarding speed limits and which ones should be put in place.  I do not have any fixed view on the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will not oppose the amendment in that case.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="424"/>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;provided there are not too many on the one stretch of road, or whatever.  Flexibility in that area would be useful.</P>
        <P>Regarding the plastic driving licences mentioned by a number of speakers, we have set 2012 as the date for their introduction.  I want to see this happening more quickly and have asked the RSA to begin work on this matter.  In addition, we are engaging with relevant stakeholders to try to advance the issue in the shortest timescale possible.  I hope it will be done very quickly.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd referred to the possibility of introducing rehabilitation schemes for certain road traffic offenders.  That is provided for and the RSA is working with the Garda in County Donegal and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  When we have the results of that pilot scheme we shall certainly move the measure forward.</P>
        <P>Many Deputies raised the issue of road conditions and the fact that they contribute to road accidents or deaths.  The figure in question is 3%.  However, it is obvious that the condition of roads deteriorated over the winter months and local authorities are now busy trying to restore them.  We are assessing the information we have but our point of view is to ask local authorities to do the work, allowing them maximum flexibility and telling them to work within the budgets they have.</P>
            <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I accept the point Deputies make regarding alcohol limits, rural isolation and lack of rural transport.  It is important that people in rural parts of Ireland have social contact and that they are able to go to a pub and have a drink.  Nobody is saying they should not do so.  All we say is that if they have two pints or consume other alcohol they should not drive home and put themselves or anybody else in danger.  I note the points Deputies made in regard to the rural transport programme.  Once this Bill is passed I am willing to engage with various stakeholders to see whether we can assist in some way but publicans and vintners must also make some contribution.</P>
        <P>Again, I thank Members for their contributions.  I look forward to a good Committee Stage debate and am willing to take on board any good suggestions.</P>

	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the critical topic of Irish aviation and tourism.  I commend Deputy Mitchell and her Fine Gael colleagues on proposing this motion and highlighting the crisis in the global and Irish travel and tourism industries.  As the motion emphasises, there has been a staggering decline in passenger numbers and tourism revenue in the past year.  Air travel with the UK, which is our closest neighbour and most important tourism market, haemorrhaged more than 700,000 passengers between February 2009 and February 2010.  This 14% decrease followed a 17% decrease in passenger numbers in January.  There have been worrying slumps in air traffic between the UK and Kerry, Shannon, Cork and Dublin airports.  The Kerry-Stansted route, for example, has had its service levels slashed over the winter period.  It saw an incredible 54% decrease in passenger numbers, to just under 4,500 passengers, in the period between February 2009 and February 2010.  It is estimated that if these trends continue throughout 2010, passenger traffic between Ireland and the UK will reach its lowest level since 1999, with a decrease of 1.75 million in passenger numbers to 9.15 million.</P>
        <P>Aer Lingus recently posted operating losses of &euro;81 million for 2009.  The extraordinary job losses in the tourism and hotel sectors have been accompanied by major job losses in the aviation sectors.  Some 1,100 jobs were lost at SR Technics and a further 400 were lost at the Dublin Airport Authority.  I spoke this afternoon about the 500 job losses at Ryanair.  Discussions on significant job losses at Aer Lingus are ongoing, but it seems that up to 600 jobs may be lost.  The Government&rsquo;s apathy about protecting the high-skilled and high-quality aviation, engineering and maintenance jobs at SR Technics has been one of the most shocking features of its period in office.  It has been compounded by the Government&rsquo;s attitude to aviation and travel taxation.  As an island nation, our air and marine connectivity is critical to getting tourists and visitors in and out of the country.  Rather than making it easier and more attractive for <Col N="427"/>people to visit this country, the Government&rsquo;s big idea for supporting the ailing travel and tourism sector has been to slap an extra &euro;10 air travel departure tax on everyone travelling through an Irish airport to airports 300 km from Dublin Airport.  This was introduced as Governments across the EU &mdash; including those in the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain &mdash; moved to abolish similar departure taxes.  It is even more galling that none of the revenue from the travel tax is being used to support aviation facilities, security and safety services or infrastructural development.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, on his promotion.  Since the introduction of the air travel tax, I have consistently asked the Ministers for Finance and Transport to publish the cost-benefit analysis that was carried out by the Department of Finance before its introduction.  So far, however, neither Minister has given me any information in this regard.  The suspicion remains that the tax was worked out on the back of a beer mat as a means of generating some easy cash for the Government rather than as a means of dealing with the issues affecting Irish aviation.  The paltry economic analysis that was provided by Ministers in budget 2009 estimated that the new tax would yield &euro;95 million in 2009 and &euro;150 million in a full year.  However, no estimate of the potentially negative knock-on effects and costs of the tax was provided.  I refer to its effects on passenger numbers, aviation jobs and employment in the tourism and hotel sectors.  It is incumbent on the Ministers, Deputies Brian Lenihan and Dempsey, to place a full cost-benefit analysis of this tax before the Oireachtas.  If they cannot do so, they should abolish it.</P>
        <P>The manner in which this tax has united opinion across the aviation industry is striking.  Aer Lingus, Ryanair and CityJet, which account for 83% of the total number of passengers who depart this island each year, jointly commissioned an independent analysis from Amsterdam Aviation Economics, which is part of the SEO economic research group.  The critical conclusions of the report were that the introduction of the air travel tax will cause estimated revenue losses of up to &euro;482 million; that it will lead to up to 3,000 direct job losses; and that, in a full year of operation, it will bring about a reduction of up to 1.2 million the Irish aviation industry&rsquo;s number of departing passengers.  That is balanced against an Exchequer tax take of just &euro;116 million.  The report states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">If airline capacity in 2009 had been maintained at 2008 levels and the ATT was to be passed on in full to passengers in the form of higher fares, it is estimated that the total resulting demand reduction would be between 0.5 and 1.2 million departing passengers over the first full year based on a price elasticity range of between &ndash;0.5 and &ndash;1.5.  On this<?oasys _jy ?>basis . . . . ATT revenue would be between &euro;117 million and &euro;124 million but total revenue losses for airlines, airports and the tourist sector would range from a minimum of &euro;210 million up to &euro;465 million, dependent on the elasticities assumed.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I drew up a rough estimate when the travel tax was introduced in the budget by the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague.  It was clear, at a glance, that the cost of this tax would be definitely far higher than its yield.</P>
        <P>This stupid tax should never have been introduced.  I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, has been given responsibility for looking after sustainable transport.  I accept that certain issues associated with aviation transport will have to be addressed, in time.  This air travel tax is not the right way to address such issues.  It is a stupid device that has resulted in serious job losses.  No matter how one looks at it, the tax will result in further job losses in the future.  The Government will not give the House a cost-benefit analysis because it does not have one.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues in the Department of Finance did not draw up such an analysis.  It does not exist.  On any basis, the travel tax should be withdrawn.  I support the motion and <Col N="428"/>urge the Government to forget about this tax.  I asked the Taoiseach a few weeks ago to ensure the Minister for Finance uses the Finance Bill 2010 to withdraw it.  That should be done at the earliest opportunity.  It is very damaging for our country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Broughan for sharing his time with me.  I commend Deputy Mitchell on her tabling of this motion.  This tax is having a serious effect on tourism in Ireland.  I would like to speak particularly about the mid-west, as it is having an extremely worrying effect on passenger numbers at Shannon Airport.  The airport has lost more than 1 million passengers in the past two years.  There is a serious danger that this airport, which is of vital infrastructural importance to the mid-west region, will become unsustainable.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, on his elevation.  I think he has some understanding of the importance of having integrated policies that deal with regions as a whole, rather than separate policies that deal with various areas differently.  The Government has no aviation policy whatsoever.  We need integrated thinking in this regard.  If we allow Shannon Airport to go down the tubes, the prosperity of an entire region will be put in jeopardy.  The travel tax can be directly implicated in the threats to the airport to which I refer.  Ryanair may be bluffing when it directly blames the tax for its decision to withdraw certain routes from Shannon.  The Government should call Michael O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s bluff.  The maintenance of existing flights is vital for the mid-west region.</P>
        <P>This issue has been highlighted by many experts, who have indicated that a travel tax is a negative feature of any country.  As my colleague, Deputy Broughan, has said, the Dutch and Spanish authorities, <i>inter alia</i>, have withdrawn travel taxes because of their effects on tourist numbers.  We cannot view airports as stand-alone pieces of infrastructure that do not have any effect on the regions in which they are located.  We need joined-up thinking and joined-up Government.  I do not have much faith that the Ministers, Deputies Dempsey and Brian Lenihan, have a real understanding of this issue.  I hope the promotion of Deputy Killeen, who represents the constituency of Clare, to the Cabinet will improve the Government&rsquo;s understanding of the importance of the issue.  I expect that the new Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Hanafin, also has some understanding of the region about which I speak.</P>
        <P>We need the Government to examine the overall effect of this tax, rather than to consider it within the narrow confines of the Departments of Transport and Finance.  As Deputy Broughan said, this crude measure was introduced simply to bring in some more tax revenue.  It is entirely counter-productive in its effect on the economy in general and on certain vulnerable regions in particular.  I suggest that the mid-west region is extremely vulnerable in this context.  There were suggestions in the media earlier this week that a plan is being hatched by the Dublin Airport Authority whereby some type of direct payment would be introduced in substitution for the travel tax for passengers at Shannon Airport.  I do not know whether these reports are accurate, but there is no point in simply replacing one tax with another tax imposed directly on passengers.  Nor is there any point in the DAA making plans for Shannon Airport behind closed doors, with no consultation with people in the region.</P>
        <P>There must be an adequate and concerted Government response to the threats that exist.  I speak both for my own region and for the entire tourism industry.  If we could attract even a small percentage of tourists from the various regions throughout the world where tourism is increasing &mdash; I have in mind eastern tourists in particular &mdash; it would make a great difference to the economy, to the many ailing hotels and to the many good tourist service providers who are struggling.  That effort must be made.  It will involve action in the area of marketing and many other aspects.  First and foremost, however, this tax is a strong counter-incentive to people to come to this country.  That problem must be addressed urgently.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>The United Kingdom, France, New Zealand and Australia have departure taxes at a much higher rate than we have.  We must deal with reality.</P>
        <P>One can understand why airlines that want to offer zero-cost flights would call for the removal of the departure tax.  However, those  airlines that are charging &euro;40 for personal check-<Col N="430"/>in, &euro;5 for the privilege of an on-line check-in, &euro;5 for credit card payment and so on should look first at these charges, which are imposed directly on consumers.  Claims by such airlines that the &euro;10 departure tax impacts in any way on their business do not stand up.  They must begin by examining their own charging structures.</P>
        <P>The Government is very much aware that the tourism industry has a turnover of more than &euro;5 billion and employs more than 200,000 people.  As such, we have allocated an increased budget for tourism, even allowing for current fiscal restraints.  It is a vital industry the development of which we must support.  I welcome the appointment of the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, to the new Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport.  Work must be done in the area of built heritage and so on, which can attract significant tourism to Ireland.  I am confident the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, will see to it that tourism will continue to grow as an indigenous business.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Government on the appointment of the esteemed actor, Mr. Gabriel Byrne, as cultural ambassador of this country.  That will afford us greater recognition on the international stage and encourage visitors who might not otherwise have considered Ireland as a holiday destination.  Last week&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade in Dublin was a fantastic spectacle.  We hope the many visitors who came to Ireland for the celebrations will return home with a positive impression of what the country has to offer.  In terms of Government investment in tourism, the convention centre which is expected to open next September will be a massive boost for tourism revenue potential.  The spend per person for the type of visitor the facility will attract is way above that of the average tourist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I said, I am surprised that Deputy Mitchell has put forward a motion calling for the abolition of the airport departure tax, for which she blames falling passenger numbers.  She seems to have got her facts wrong; perhaps it is the George Lee factor.  I ask that she be more careful the next time she tables a motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Thanks for the advice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe, on his appointment.  As Deputy Kennedy observed, the air travel tax raised &euro;100 million over a ten-month period and is expected to bring in &euro;125 million in a full year.  That is a sizeable sum.  Other countries in the European Union, namely, the United Kingdom and France, as well as Australia and New Zealand also have a travel tax in place.  However, I welcome the reduction in the tax to &euro;2 on shorter journeys.  This means all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow are subject to the lower rate.</P>
        <P>Low-cost travel has been good for Ireland, and I commend all those who pioneered progress in this area.  However, we should be concerned that airlines are reducing routes globally, regardless of what taxes apply.  We must promote travel and tourism to this country.  Visits to Ireland by non-residents were down by some 11% between January 2009 and June 2009 compared with the same period in 2008.  There always will be pressure to raise revenues.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs in 2007 and 2008, there was always pressure from the Department Finance to increase the price of a passport, for example.  That proposal was resisted but the increase was eventually introduced.  Our decision to waive the charge for those in receipt of a State pension was very welcome.  I spoke to people today who are concerned about getting their passports renewed in view of the action by union staff.  The charge for emergency passports remains at &euro;50, but if people could get as far as the counter they would be glad to pay it and would have little concern about a travel tax.  That is the situation but it begs the question as to why we have only two passport offices in Cork and <Col N="431"/>Dublin.  There are people from Galway contacting the Cork office to get a passport and there is a need for two extra offices in the west and the north west to process passport applications.  I raised this issue as a Minister of State in 2007 and I do not believe it would be too expensive to provide these offices.  It would save people long journeys if they were able to apply in their own region for a passport, which could be provided at regional airports.  I have lobbied the current Minister for Foreign Affairs on this and I hope he makes further progress on it.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, on her new ministerial appointment.  There is great tourism potential and she is a capable person who will deliver on that potential.  I cannot understand why the Office of Public Works is being criticised in the Fine Gael motion because the OPW has marvellous heritage sites.  Most of them will open earlier this year and the admission prices will be at the 2009 level, which I welcome.</P>
        <P>A balance must be struck between raising revenue and reducing spending, due to the current pressures on the public finances.  We have to market this country properly overseas, as Tourism Ireland has done.  It did a great job for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and the fact that it fell on a Wednesday meant that we could have a longer festival.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland must also be commended for a programme that encourages people to holiday at home.  I hope we will get good value for consumers in Ireland.  We have a lot to offer in this area and it is important that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is supported.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the opening of the new convention centre in Dublin and the new Aviva stadium in Ballsbridge.  Our Oireachtas committee went out there to see the work that was going on during the construction of these facilities.</P>
        <P>It is encouraging to see that we are spending more money in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism this year.  There has been a 2% increase on the 2009 figure, and it is important that this &euro;153 million funding is spent wisely.  We have to promote major visitor attractions and the infrastructure for areas that have not been developed in the past, such as recreational cycling, walking, water-based activities and heritage attractions.  The campaign by our tourism organisations should promote these areas and outline what can be done.  A total of &euro;44.25 million has been provided for tourism marketing in 2010 and this will increase the investment in the overseas marketing of Ireland.  I hope we can get value for money in obtaining advertising space and show what can be done to promote the country.</P>
        <P>I welcome this debate tonight.  I congratulate the two Ministers mentioned and I hope we have a good tourist season in 2010.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, on his elevation.  I think he will be very suited to his new position.</P>
        <P>We have spent much resources over the last few years on building up our tourism product here.  In the areas of training and education, hospitality services, hotel management and so on, we have managed to build up a product that is seen as being very unique and attractive.  This did not happen by accident.  Much planning went into producing the product and making sure that it was sold properly around the world.  We have managed to do that.</P>
        <P>The successful growth of the tourism industry in Ireland has been phenomenal in the past ten years.  The fact that we are in a global recession has hit us harder than many other countries.  Ireland is a small peripheral country on the edge of Europe, so we have a difficult job to do in selling the country.  The economic downturn is a challenge for everybody.  We depend heavily on tourism as a major part of the economy in Dublin city and in my constituency.  We have hundreds of hotels and restaurants which depend solely on the tourists they attract into the city.</P><Col N="432"/>
        <P>While we have had to make very difficult decisions on how we deal with the economy, it is a challenge for all sectors of society and not just the tourism industry.  We have to try to be fair with any decisions that we make.  The introduction of this tax by the Department of Finance is an effort to make sure that a fair share is taken by all sides.  The question is whether the &euro;10 travel tax influences people when they make a decision to come to Ireland.  I have not heard that question answered.  I do not know whether there are statistics to prove that the &euro;125 million to be brought in by this tax is counterbalanced by a loss of those people who decided not to come.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>

	<P>When we are in a position to do away with this tax, it will be done.</P>
        <P>The domestic market in Ireland now accounts for 65% of business in the intensely competitive hotel sector.  That is a very significant proportion of hotel business. The State agencies have done a great job in trying to promote the domestic market, and there is a great future for that.  Deputy Kitt mentioned the national conference centre, which is in my constituency on Spencer Dock.  That is due to open on time in September 2010 and it will provide a great boost to business and conference tourism in future years.  I do not know whether a &euro;10 charge will make a major difference to people attending conferences at the centre.  While the global economic conditions remain challenging, the level of bookings and inquiries about the centre are very encouraging.  It has recently announced that it has confirmed 29 international events, with over 236,000 delegate days secured.  That is a major boost to any economy.  I do not think those delegates would not come here because of the tax.</P>
        <P>In 2009, some 6.927 million overseas visitors came to the Republic of Ireland.  It was a decrease on previous years, but there were record increases for the previous five or six years and we could not sustain that anyway.  We must ensure that we can provide the services for the millions of people who visit this country, and that there is a standard of service that competes with the rest of the world.  We have put major resources into maintaining that standard.  We put major resources into training and education for our young people in management and accounting services.  Some 3.25 million of those people came from Great Britain, while 2.38 million came from mainland Europe.  Meanwhile, 0.98 million came from North America and 0.31 million came from other areas.  We know where our market is and that was taken into account with the introduction of this tax, where there was a &euro;2 charge, as opposed to a &euro;10 charge, for our main market in Britain.  The introduction of that tax will not deter those people from coming to Ireland.  There is a huge opportunity for us to continue to sell Ireland as a destination and we have managed to do so.  The air travel tax will raise &euro;125 million in a full year.  The question is whether the tax has an influence on people travelling here.  That aspect should be examined.</P>
        <P>If the opportunity arises and things improve, we could look at reversing the tax.  In the current economic climate, however, all sectors of society must contribute.  The incoming Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Mary Hanafin, has a long association with travel matters.  She will bring a new vision to the Department and I am sure that in future every effort will be made to ensure that Ireland competes internationally on a favourable basis with other destinations.</P>

	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to participate in this discussion, which is relevant and topical given the current economic climate.  The effect of the air travel tax has been overstated by the Opposition parties.  We all have a view on it and are all lobbied by particular interest groups, but nobody has contacted me to make a complaint about the tax, or said it was a barrier to travel to or from Ireland.</P>

	<P Just="Left">That is fine, but the revenue is coming in to the central Exchequer so it is important from that point of view.  We must raise revenue.  We recently had a debate about hangar 6 when both Labour and Fine Gael adopted positions on it.  I did not hear Opposition Members then calling on either Aer Lingus or Ryanair to reduce their charges or fees for passengers.  Let us have some equity in this debate.  I note that the motion refers to &ldquo;the significant burden of local authority rates&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>They want the power but they do not want the responsibility.  I have listened to organisations, such as ISME and the Irish Hotels&rsquo; Federation, which cite local authority rates as being a huge burden. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I point them back in the direction of the Opposition parties which control the local authorities.  We must discuss the joint labour committees, and the social part<Col N="434"/>nership structures need to be fundamentally changed.  It is not good enough to have ISME and the Irish Hotels&rsquo; Federation outside the door, while IBEC has a veto because it is inside and involved in the parallel process.  Small and medium enterprises are employing many people, yet it is significant that they are not included in the face-to-face discussions.  I would like to see them there.  </P>
        <P>Zombie hotels were referred to, but we also have zombie golf courses and leisure centres, which have sprung up in recent years.  The market will regulate whether they remain in business.  The motion also refers to &ldquo;the Government-generated shortage in the supply of cars for the rental market&rdquo;.  I did not know that the Government was in the business of supplying cars for the rental market.</P>

	<P>I congratulate Deputy Mary Hanafin on her appointment to the important brief of tourism, culture and sport.  There is a big tourism market and great potential to be tapped into.  I know that she will apply her skills to that.  Based on her track record in the education and social welfare portfolios, we can look forward to that potential being realised.</P>
        <P>Many people are experiencing difficulties in obtaining passports at the moment.  In addition, the travel plans of many Irish people abroad are being inhibited because of the current difficulties.  We need a speedy resolution to the problem, so I call on the trade union leadership to come back in line and give this service to the people.  Public service is about providing services to people, not the other way around.  In this day and age, it is not acceptable to deny people their constitutional right to avail of a passport.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish holiday experience has been promoted far and wide.  We provide a high quality holiday experience.

	<P>I am glad to contribute to this important debate and I commend my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, for bringing forward the motion at this time.  I also wish to congratulate Deputy Mary Hanafin on her new appointment as Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport.  She has shown herself to be an independent thinker in the past and I hope she will address herself to the issues we are debating tonight.  It would be a great start for her to do so.  I offer her my congratulations. </P>
        <P>The introduction of tax measures, pay cuts and income levies over the last 18 months means that nearly half a million people are out of work.  Despite protestations from the Government that the worst is over and that we have turned the comer, the evidence on the ground is the opposite.  Continued calls and appeals for a stimulus package to go alongside the cutbacks have fallen on deaf ears.  We are told that the only show in town is to save the banks, sort out the <Col N="435"/>financial mess and jobs will follow.  Not only is there no stimulus package but one service industry, namely tourism, that could provide at least a partial solution is further penalised with the travel tax.  It would be great to have a stimulus package but instead of solutions we got further problems.  Instead of hope we have more despair and instead of increasing the number of tourists arriving on our shores, we have had the opposite.  Almost 1 million fewer tourists came here last year, which is back to 2005 levels.</P>
        <P>Nobody is suggesting that the travel tax is responsible for all of the fall-off but it is a major contributory factor.  The evidence is there that once airlines drop their prices, as Aer Lingus and Ryanair have done, there is an immediate surge in passenger numbers.  There would be a similar bounce if the travel tax was removed.  At this stage, it is not just the vested interests, such as the airlines and tourism bodies, that are outlining the damaging effects of the departure tax; independent analysts are now giving evidence of its effect.  The example of other countries that have scrapped their tourist taxes, such as Spain, Greece, Belgium and the Netherlands, should now be followed in this country.</P>
        <P>My own county of Mayo and the north west region, which has wonderful tourism potential, is a case in point.  Ireland West Airport Knock has, against all the odds, helped to stimulate tourism in the past 25 years.  Passenger numbers at the airport have increased year by year and the last thing that is needed is another obstacle to its success.  Whether they are visiting for the scenery, activity holidays, fishing, walking or pilgrimages to Knock or Croagh Patrick, the economic value of every passenger who comes through the airport and stays for even two or three days means that tourism jobs in hotels, bed and breakfasts and adventure centres are either created or protected.  Why should we pick visitors&rsquo; pockets when they are departing our country after spending their money among our people?  Passengers departing from Ireland West Airport paid &euro;2.5 million in travel tax in 2009.  Interestingly, until the introduction of the travel tax at the end of 2008, the airport was the fastest growing airport in Ireland, with a 154% increase in passenger numbers.  Even in 2009, numbers were maintained at 2008 levels, while other airports experienced a 20% drop.</P>
        <P>The &euro;2.5 million from the travel tax, if it were removed, would allow the airport to develop its great potential.  Ireland West Airport Knock is by far the largest airport in the BMW region, accounting for 83% of all overseas passengers flying directly into the region from 25 international destinations.  Independent analysis by Goodbody Economic Consultants has established that passengers going through the airport make a contribution of &euro;62 million to the economy in tourism spending, and tax and PRSI from the airport are worth &euro;8.7 million.  It must be pointed out that on top of the imposition of the travel tax, Knock Airport must pay 100% of its air traffic control charges, which is not the case in State airports.</P>
        <P>What is needed is stimulus rather than extra taxes, encouragement rather than obstacles.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony for sharing his time and support the motion tabled by our colleague Deputy Mitchell.  I wish the Minister luck in her new portfolio, which has been rebranded.  I hope she, unlike her predecessors in that portfolio, will take a hands-on approach to tourism.  Tourism is in decline, not necessarily in the urban areas or the major cities, but throughout the country in rural areas.  There are many reasons for this &mdash; we could lay blame all over the place &mdash; but there is no doubt the high costs endured by visitors have turned away many people.</P>
        <P>There is one thing in particular the Minister must achieve.  All agencies involved in tourism &mdash; F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the OPW, the local authorities and so on &mdash; must be drawn together to produce a co-ordinated package, which has been needed for a long time.  Many people contribu<Col N="436"/>ting to this debate have mentioned the OPW, which has done tremendous work in terms of physical building, conservation and so on.  However, last week on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, the first day of the tourism season in Ireland, what happened?  The OPW closed the doors of museums, castles and other facilities around the country.  Tourists who had come from every part of the world found that when the parades were over the doors were closed on most of the opportunities for us to show off our culture and heritage, which most of them had come to see.  It is important that in two weeks&rsquo; time, when another tranche of visitors arrives for Easter week, the Minister insists that all these facilities be available to the public, particularly those who have come from abroad to see them.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the need for a hands-on approach.  I reminded the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor of the wonderful hub of tourist activity in Portumna, County Galway, that was centred on Emerald Star Line, which provides boats on the Shannon and Lough Derg.  The company decided to take 60% of its operation from Portumna and bring it to France, which must have set alarm bells ringing in tourism circles about what could happen in our country.  I highlighted this to the former Minister, who chose to ignore it and said it was a commercial decision of the company to move elsewhere.  Surely, hidden within that statement, there was an acknowledgement that we were losing the battle and that he, as Minister with responsibility for tourism, was doing nothing to turn it around.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must consider what a community can do for tourism when it gets involved.  That is why I am asking that the Minister activate the community.  For example, Galway won, against international competition, the chance to host once more the finish of the Volvo Ocean Race, through the initiative of a community-based organisation led by two fantastic entrepreneurs who decided they could compete with the best, not only in Europe, but also in the world, to bring the race back to Galway.  This will bring 200,000 bed nights and &euro;60 million to a small city, and its effects will also reverberate around the county.  That could be replicated in many areas around the country to allow the industry to grow once more, if only there was an initiative by the Government.  To be fair, the Government did support Galway&rsquo;s endeavour through grant aid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I too wish the Minister well in her new portfolio, which is an important one.</P>
        <P>The economies of Ireland and the mid-west are suffering to a far greater extent than those of other countries and regions in the global village in which we live.  This is due in no small part to the introduction of the travel tax, which came into operation as a result of the fundamentally flawed and rushed budget of October 2008.  That budget was presented in a panic by a new Minister for Finance who had not yet found his feet and many of its measures have since been rescinded.  The short-sighted imposition of this tax has resulted in a nosedive in the fortunes of Ireland&rsquo;s tourism sector.  Across my own constituency of Clare, businesses have closed down and jobs have been lost in hotels, pubs, bed and breakfasts, shops and restaurants.</P>
        <P>Ryanair accounted for nearly 50% of passenger traffic through Shannon Airport in 2007 and nearly 60% in 2008.  The low-fares airline transformed Shannon Airport into a major European hub, delivering 1.9 million passengers yearly.  The travel tax and airport charges have been cited by Ryanair as its reasons for withdrawing 75% of its business from Shannon.  Deputy Timmy Dooley, in his contribution to this debate yesterday, was virtually laughing at Ryanair&rsquo;s new proposal to deliver 1.2 million passengers if amended terms can be agreed with the airport authority and the travel tax is abolished.  Deputy Dooley&rsquo;s position on this is outrageous.  The bottom line is that the region needs this vital traffic.</P><Col N="437"/>
        <P>Time and again, Fianna F&aacute;il has let down Shannon Airport.  County Clare simply cannot afford to give the two fingers to any carrier, especially one that has a proven track record of delivering large numbers of passengers.  This week the DAA tried to stop the haemorrhaging of passengers from Shannon Airport by advancing a proposal to abolish charges for airlines by charging passengers directly.  It is incredible that one Government agency is trying to find ways to save money for airlines while the Department of Finance is refusing to remove a needless tax.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Groups advising the Government, such as the Commission on Taxation and the tourism renewal group, have condemned the tax and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, IBEC and the National Competitiveness Council want it abolished.  Ryanair boss Michael O&rsquo;Leary, Aer Lingus CEO Christoph Mueller and CityJet CEO Geoffrey White are all in agreement that this tax must go.  Countries like the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark and Greece have either reduced airport taxes or abolished travel taxes.  Why can we not do the same in this country?</P>
        <P>Yesterday we saw the appointment of Deputy Tony Killeen to the Cabinet and I congratulate him and wish him well.  He should use his new powers to advance the interests of the county he was elected to represent.  This tax has, in effect, driven the vast majority of Ryanair business from Shannon Airport.  That in turn has led to a loss in business, connectivity to Shannon and jobs, which has resulted in a spiral of economic decline.  This decline could be halted if those elected in the mid-west region from Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary stand for their region tonight and vote for this Fine Gael motion to abolish this disastrous tax.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Lucinda Creighton has four minutes and we are on a very tight schedule.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is perfectly acceptable.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, on her new portfolio and wish her the best of luck with it.  We are in challenging times in every sector of the economy and there is much potential to grow in the tourism area.  The Minister will bring her skills to bear on that Department and I hope she will take on board some of the points made by us on the Opposition benches tonight.  I thank Deputy Olivia Mitchell for bringing forward this very sensible motion.</P>
        <P>My colleagues have spoken about the well-documented and substantial decline in revenues generated by the tourism industry in Ireland over the past 18 months or so.  It is unfortunate and very damaging to the overall economic position in the country.  We know that all aspects of the tourism industry, through the arts and cultural, heritage or hospitality elements, as well as ancillary activities and businesses, are under significant pressure.  It is essential for us to acknowledge this and respond to it.</P>
        <P>Air travel is a very important element of the issue.  When it comes to innovating in air travel, Ireland has become a world leader, due in no small part to the significant success of Ryanair and the drive and innovation of Michael O&rsquo;Leary.  He often gets much flak and undue criticism but I hold him up as an inspiration and somebody we could learn much from in terms of how we run our economy.  He has done immense and often unrecognised things with Ryanair, innovating not just in the airline sector in this country but setting an example of an economic model that has been followed in all corners of the world by other airlines.</P>
        <P>It amazes me that when we have such a successful company in this country, the Government appears to be prepared to scapegoat the airline industry.  It is important to point out that the various companies involved in air travel do not have their hands out for subsidies and are not looking to be propped up in any shape or form.  They are seeking fair and fertile conditions in which to grow, which is not too much to ask for.</P><Col N="438"/>
        <P>The departure tax penalises an industry that is innovative and which is a world leader; I cannot understand the logic.  We need to encourage more growth in the industry and as an island State we particularly need to encourage air travel to and from this country.  The departure tax does precisely the opposite so I urge the Minister to consider reversing it.</P>
        <P>I will go on a slight tangent before concluding.  The Government must adopt measures to support tourism.  The services industry has been completely let down by this Government and the one element our party called for as a priority in our pre-budget submission was a reduction in the lower rate of VAT to 10.5%.  This would make an enormous difference to restaurants, hotels and other labour-intensive industries.  I hope the Minister will think about it because it is essential for employment in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputy Olivia Mitchell on putting this motion before the House.  It is topical and timely as we now have a new Minister responsible for tourism.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, and as her family was involved in the hotel business many years ago, I know she has a great interest in and feel for tourism.  The first step she should take is to follow in the argument of her predecessor and former Minister, Martin Cullen, for the removal of the travel tax.  It would be a great start for the Minister, not just because it would be of significant benefit but because of the direction in which it would send the tourism industry.</P>
        <P>There is much potential in the tourism industry, with some 500,000 people in this country unemployed.  The Government and all agencies are considering every way to get those people back to work and in my considered opinion, there are two areas where there has traditionally been significant employment in the past but which we have not looked after in the Celtic tiger years.  They are agriculture and tourism.</P>
        <P>Tonight is about tourism and the significant potential for job creation in that area.  Many issues have been discussed tonight which are impediments to a tourism revival in this country.  For example, we spoke about the lack of rental cars, which was created by the mismanagement of this Government.  It put in place a scrappage scheme which had an effect on the supply of cars so the Government and its Cabinet must deal with the problem.  It is one example that must be tackled.</P>
        <P>We need to bring people into the country and make Ireland competitive again.  Hotels are dropping rates and across the country deals are being made.  The Government should be about leadership and it should cut the travel tax.  It would not have a significant impact on the economy but it would send the message that the Irish Government is serious about bringing people into this country.</P>
        <P>There is much investment hanging on a thread.  How many golf courses, hotels and other private businesses are under severe pressure and living from day to day?  If we could get more people into the country, it would help such businesses overcome their difficulties.  There would be more people employed and there would be a buoyancy in the economy.  It is one of the real ways in which Ireland can restore itself.</P>
        <P>I beg the Minister to follow Martin Cullen&rsquo;s wish and go back to the Cabinet to try to change the travel tax measure.  It is very important for the future of our country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to this motion and I compliment our spokesperson, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, on bringing it before the D&aacute;il.  As the previous speaker, Deputy Tom Hayes, has noted, tourism is a very important product in this <Col N="439"/>country.  I come from Westport which is one of the most beautiful towns in the country and it is very much dependent on tourism.</P>
      
        <P>The tourism sector is extremely important in the context of job creation.  Many people in Westport depend on tourism.  In that context, we should be considering ways to attract more visitors to the country.  By helping the economy to return to a position of growth, tourism is one of the industries that will assist us in emerging from the recession.  However, those in the industry are going to require support.  We will be obliged to consider ways in which we might attract increasing numbers of visitors.</P>
        <P>The travel tax is outrageous.  It is imposed on people leaving and entering the country.  This tax is not necessary and more money is being lost than is being gained as a result of its imposition.  Mr. O&rsquo;Leary of Ryanair stated that he could encourage many more people to visit the country if the tax was not in place.  In light of the small amount of money it brings in to the Exchequer, it is time the travel tax was abolished.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Some hotels open on a year-round basis.  There are 11 hotels in Westport.  These hotels cannot obtain the same price for their product in December as they can in August.  As a result, they are obliged to reduce their prices.  That is why the Government must re-examine the position with regard to the travel tax.  It must also consider other ways in which the industry might be encouraged, assisted and supported.  Those in the hotel industry want action to be taken with regard to the stealth taxes that apply in respect of their sector.  The rates relating to hotels that open on a year-round basis will have to be reduced in the same way they are for hotels which close for three or four months of the year.</P>
        <P>Tourism is an extremely important industry.  I hope the Minister will lobby other members of the Cabinet, particularly the Minister for Finance, in respect of it.  I wish her well in her new position.  Despite what people state, hers is an important portfolio.  Tourism is a vital industry which can create even further jobs.  All those in it are seeking is some support and assistance from the Government in order that the jobs which already exist might be protected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on her new portfolio, which, as previous speakers indicated, is extremely important and which has a great deal of potential.  I hope she will exploit that potential to the fullest possible extent in order to assist those in the tourism industry.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for moving this motion, particularly as tourism is a key issue at present.  Those in the industry estimate that the travel tax is responsible for &euro;480 million of the &euro;1.2 billion decrease in tourism incomes.  The tax brings in &euro;91 million to the Exchequer.  If one takes it that 20% would be the taxable income from &euro;480 million, then that is almost &euro;100 million.  In view of the fact that 3,000 jobs have been lost at a cost of &euro;21,000 each per annum, the figure rises to &euro;163 million.  This means that the net loss already stands at &euro;70 million.  The tax is, therefore, costing the Exchequer at least that amount.  This is before one considers the effect it has on small local bed and breakfast establishments and hotels and the grocery shops and other businesses which supply them with goods and services.</P>
        <P>The area of Fingal in which I reside and which I represent has great tourism potential, particularly as much of it is located next to the Irish Sea.  In that context, the travel tax is having an extremely negative effect on families in Swords, Malahide, Balbriggan, Rush, Lusk and Skerries which are dependent on this industry.  We ought to listen to those &mdash; including the tourism renewal group, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Commission on Taxation, the National Competitiveness Council, IBEC, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, Ryanair, Cityjet, Aer Lingus and the Irish Hotels Federation &mdash; who have requested that the tax be abolished.  The tax does <Col N="440"/>no favours to the Dublin Airport Authority, the companies which serve the airport or anyone who is employed there.</P>
        <P>Jobs are being put at risk as a result of this tax.  The only thing which compares to this crazy and hare-brained measure is the increase in VAT which the Minister for Finance introduced and then admitted was costing the country hundreds of millions of euro.  However, he also failed to take action in respect of that matter.  The writing is on the wall.  This tax must be removed.</P>
        <P>A body that could deal with the excess bed capacity that exists in hotels must surely be established under the aegis of the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  This body could put in place an initiative to encourage the Irish Hotels Federation, the airlines and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to take action &mdash; including by means of offering cheap flights &mdash; in order to attract more visitors to this country and fill some of that capacity.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mitchell stated that, in Government, Fine Gael would abolish this tax.  We hope that in response to such a move, Ryanair and Aer Lingus would restore the routes they cut as a consequence of the introduction of the tax.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, on her new portfolio.  I consider her to be a capable member of a rather incapable Government.</P>
        <P>One of the difficulties the Government faces is that no member of the Cabinet has ever been in business.  Government Ministers know nothing about paying rates or the JLC wage structure.  They do not understand the difficulties faced by businesses.  I am sure it is a nice accounting trick to impose a &euro;10 tax on everyone who flies into the country in order to raise tens of millions.  There is no doubt that this is a handy way to bring in money but, as previous speakers stated, it is costing us more in the long term.</P>
        <P>There has been some discussion with regard to the destinations to which people can fly in this country.  Areas with airports are lucky because they get the first bite at the cherry in the context of attracting tourism revenues.  However, difficulties arise for areas which do not contain accessible airports because the statistics show that fewer people are prepared to travel on to the regions from the point at which they enter the country.  I refer to the county in which I live, Wexford, in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Ceann Comhairle has family in Blackwater in County Wexford.  He will be familiar with Courtown, to which tax designation was granted in the early 1990s.  As a result of the tax breaks available from the State, thousands of houses were built in Courtown.  However, we cannot encourage people to stay in these houses when they come here, particularly if the Government is intent on imposing a tax on those who travel to this country by aeroplane.  The starting point with regard to dealing with this matter is the abolition of the travel tax, which is a stupid measure.  In addition, the Government must offer some form of incentive for tourists to visit areas where tax breaks were offered to people to build houses.  There are thousands of houses in some areas that were given tax designation but there are no tourism attractions in these places.  The Government must take action to reverse the position and put in place such attractions.</P>
        <P>On the subject of zombie hotels, I spoke to one individual who is a hotelier &mdash; he is not a developer &mdash; and whose business it is to provide people with a place to stay.  There has been a great deal of discussion with regard to the provision of services in this State, particularly to those who come here to spend money while on holiday.  The man to whom I refer is in competition with hotels that are operated by State-guaranteed banks.  He is, therefore, in competition with the taxpayer in the context of trying to provide people with a place to stay.  In such circumstances, there is no way he can win.</P><Col N="441"/>
        <P>When the banks get their money from NAMA and do whatever it is they intend to do with the hotels they own, the man to whom I refer and others like him will still be trading.  These are the people the Minister will be meeting during the next two years or so.  It is they who she will need to assist her in driving the industry forward.  It would be reckless of her if she failed to ensure that those to whom I refer will not be subjected to unfair competition.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputies opposite for offering me their good wishes on my appointment.  I am glad that Private Members&rsquo; time has been given over to a debate on a subject as important as tourism.  This debate belies comment in the media to the effect that tourism, culture and sport are not important to this country&rsquo;s people or its economy.  Tourism is important as regards its potential to give rise to employment and investment and must be viewed in the context of the domestic and international markets.  There is a resolve among people throughout all of the sectors to market the best of what is Ireland.  Certainly, over the coming years I aim to prove that, as one of our indigenous industries, tourism, which already employs 200,000 people, is one area which we can expand and which will promote Ireland.  I look forward to doing that and to working with the Opposition spokespersons on something which is genuinely in the best interests of the Irish people.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to take this opportunity to address the House on the subject of the air travel tax and the wide range of issues raised in the motion.  I understand that last night my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, did not have the opportunity to address some of the issues raised in the motion and I hope to address these outstanding points.</P>
        <P>Deputies are aware of the general economic position and the responsibility of the Government to bridge the gap between expenditure and income.  The air travel tax is but one of the measures adopted for this purpose and so far it has raised &euro;99 million and will raise &euro;125 million in a full year.  Any party coming into the House arguing for the abolition of a tax has a responsibility to specify an alternative way of raising that revenue.  Is Fine Gael suggesting we raise it by increasing income tax, VAT or excise duty?  It has been recognised by all commentators that our revenue base has been very weak in recent years.  There is an onus on anyone advocating its further depletion to identify where that revenue base can be shored up.  Our options are limited and given the significant drop in the tax take, we have to find ways to raise moneys which we need to pay in part for vital public services.  It is not an option for Government to succumb to every eye-catching interest group that walks past these buildings.  That may be a luxury in which Opposition Deputies can indulge from time to time &mdash; not always, I accept &mdash; but we cannot.</P>
        <P>In shoring up the gap between what we as a State take in and what we spend, the Government has to take an overall view that ensures the burden is spread fairly across all sectors.  I would be the first to acknowledge that low cost travel has been good for Ireland.  The pioneers in this area deserve to be commended.  Mr. O&rsquo;Leary has spoken very eloquently on the subject of this tax and I have listened very carefully to what he has had to say about it.  However, it is simply not credible to argue that the new tax is to blame for the fall in passenger numbers.</P>
        <P>We need to bring a sense of balance to this aspect of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="442"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>It would hardly increase them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past few years, we saw exceptional growth in air travel both to and from Ireland.  Irish residents in many cases made several trips abroad in a calendar year.  The downturn in the economy and increased economic uncertainty has seen a change in behaviour in this regard.  Consumers are not taking as many foreign trips as they did at the height of the boom.  All Members of the House know that and it is a pretence to state it is caused by the air travel tax.  That is the reason for the fall in passenger numbers.  To suggest that people are not travelling because of a tax of &euro;10 is tendentious.  An air trip abroad generally involves expenditure of several hundred euro.  Singling out the &euro;10 tax charge as the major disincentive for the intending traveller is stretching credibility.  How can it be argued that the tax is more of a disincentive, for example, than the non-discretionary on-line check-in fee of &euro;5 per flight or &euro;10 per return flight?  That is to single out just one of the myriad charges imposed by the airlines.</P>
        <P>The introduction of a modest air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure in the context of the financial challenges we now face.  The Government regards this tax as a fair tax in the current circumstances and I have no immediate plans to abolish it.  It will raise approximately &euro;125 million in a full year in circumstances where those additional revenues are required to fund badly needed services.</P>
        <P>Every sector can argue against taxation.  Last night, my colleagues on this side of the House referred to the fact that having a debate on tourism which focuses on the &euro;10 tax really misses the point.  Ultimately, airlines respond to consumer demand.  They will fly where people want to go.  Everyone in the tourism sector, supported by Government, must ensure that our tourism experience is of a top standard and that the industry is flexible to meet the changing demands of holidaymakers.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, last night outlined the significant Government investment in tourism.  My colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Mary Hanafin, will make the extension of numbers and of the tourism industry a key priority in her Department in the years ahead.  The sector faces challenges but we are committed to supporting this valuable industry with the resources available to us.</P>
        <P>Deputy Upton made the point that we need to focus on emerging markets, particularly Asia, for growth in tourism numbers.  However, she noted that the visa application process in some Asian countries can be slow and therefore hampers any such growth.  That issue falls within the remit of the Department of Justice and Law Reform and I understand that it has stated it is open at all times to suggestions on how the visa service rules and requirements can be improved to meet the needs of all sectors affected by visa issues, including the tourism sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, for tabling the motion.  It is timely in terms of the Cabinet reshuffle and I congratulate the Minister.  I listened to her on the radio this morning and she was right to talk up the Department.  The tourism product is something on which we can hang our hat in moving the economy forward.</P>
        <P>The Minister should seriously examine the cultural landscape of rail tourism and the landscape possibilities and permutations we have for it.  I have been beating the drum on this for a while.  The Minister should sit down with the new Minister of State with responsibility for sustainable transportation, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe, because he has already planned to try to push the western rail corridor.  In fairness to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, he has been an advocate of rail along the western corridor and there is a drive towards putting rail tourism on the map in the west.  The Minister should follow the commitment we bought into constitutionally in the 1998 referendum on the Good Friday Agreement and look at the <Col N="443"/>possibility of interlinkages in the transport sector.  The British Irish Parliamentary Assembly has backed a motion for rail connectivity on an all-island basis.  That has passed at British, Irish and Northern Irish level and what it needs now is proactivity at governmental level in this country.</P>
        <P>A Chinese citizen who decides to visit Belfast must obtain a holiday visa and that is fair enough.  However, if that Chinese tourist decides to take a trip from there to Donegal or Dublin, he or she must obtain a second visa.  The all-island agenda provides an opportunity to consider a single visa and a single point of entry for foreign tourists.  The former Minister was not aware of this anomaly when I raised it previously.  The Minister should seriously consider it because it creates bureaucracy and inaccessibility for people from outside the European Union who want to visit this country.</P>
        <P>I am willing to work with the Minister as an Opposition spokesperson with a keen interest in tourism from a county, Donegal, that has always been furthest from the minds of those in the tourism industry.  We have opportunities.  Last year, 400,000 tourists visited the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway in Antrim.  It is not our job to try to displace the tourist attraction at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway; we would not succeed.  However, we have an opportunity to help those tourists continue their journey.  Why not consider a joined-up single all-island marketing strategy that will enable 400,000 people not necessarily to cross the Border into Donegal, but to continue their journey?  The Minister has the skills for this joined up thinking.  She has proved herself at other Departments and I look to her to show some initiative in the three areas I raised.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, for bringing this issue to the fore.  I wish the Minister well in her new portfolio.  I am somewhat disappointed with the Minister for Finance tonight.  I assume that he has to back the budget measures but with regard to the rationale behind what he stated, I fully appreciate the &euro;10 travel tax is not the reason the entire thing has fallen to 2004 levels.  Nobody is suggesting that.  Our essential point is that from a tourism perspective, right across the world all indications are that people like to come to Ireland because we are a friendly nation, which hopefully will continue.  This always is the top reason in all surveys and is of great importance.  Anything that takes away from this is bad for Ireland.  It should be noted that governments and nations throughout the world are doing their level best to do what we also are trying to do here, which is to get more people to visit their respective tourist spots.  In the last budget, the Government added another trap that would make it a little more difficult for those who sell our product globally to come to Ireland.  That is all that happened.  In bad or difficult times, such loading, even if it only amounts to &euro;1, sends out the wrong signal.  Hopefully, we will return to a position whereby far more people will visit Ireland than there are natives living here.  Both Fine Gael and the new Minister want to see the country teeming with visitors.  I would like to spend half an hour discussing the point that regardless of how one attracts such visitors in, the subsequent distribution constitutes another major story on which Members do not have the time to dwell this evening.  However, the travel tax simply sends out the wrong signal at the wrong time, which is the reason so many people were sickened by what happened.</P>
        <P>I refer to an issue on which Deputy Mitchell has argued strongly.  It is to be hoped that this tax will be removed shortly and I expect that on foot of its abolition, when and if that happens, the strategic routes axed by both Aer Lingus and Ryanair will be restored because they are vital to the tourism industry.  I will conclude by asking the Ministers of Tourism, Culture and Sport and Finance to take seriously the issue of zombie hotels.  As far as I can ascertain, the banks and their supporters are putting family-run hotels out of business.  Should this happen, it would be nothing short of a disaster.  While I do not know how this might be achieved, I ask <Col N="444"/>the Ministers opposite not to allow the banks to add insult to injury by keeping the aforementioned hotels open for their own purposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish the new Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport good luck in her new Department.  I was pleased to hear her recognise the importance to the economy of tourism and that this is what she intends to promote because that will be absolutely necessary.  Last night, my colleagues and I spoke at great length about the various obstacles lying in the path of this industry with specific reference from a political perspective to those which are imposed by the Government.  Members also discussed the so-called zombie hotels, namely, the tax incentivised hotels and their destructive impact on existing hotels and bed and breakfast establishments nationwide.  Insolvent hotels are being subvented by banks which the public in turn are subventing and the Government must have a role in ensuring that such insolvent hotels are allowed to fail because otherwise, good businesses will fail.  This is the way the market works.  It is painful but it must happen and the sooner it happens the better for everyone as there then can be a return to normal trading conditions and competition practices.</P>
        <P>Members also discussed the availability of cars for hire, which also was discussed on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  While the Minister for Finance stated it would have cost &euro;7 million to include the car hire industry in the scrappage scheme, the cost to the country of not including it is &euro;260 million.  A triple whammy is befalling this particular industry that will have a huge impact nationwide.  Moreover, this will not be limited to the car hire industry but also will affect hotels and the bed and breakfast sector in particular, which is 80% dependent on people who hire cars.  While the impact will be nationwide, it will affect the regions in particular.  Moreover, this issue will cause both problems this year and reputational damage subsequently because turning people away for the lack of cars to give them sends out the signal that Ireland simply is not geared up for the tourism industry.  In addition, those cars that are available are outrageously priced when compared with all our competitors.  Consequently, something must be done in this regard and the Minister will ignore this problem at her peril, regardless of what the Minister for Finance sitting beside her might tell her.</P>
        <P>My colleagues also discussed the cost and complexity of getting a visa to visit Ireland.  While the cost involved is one aspect of this issue, the complexity and nature of the questions and conditions required of people who try to apply for a visa are such that they would make one lose the will to live, much less to travel to a country that would dream up such conditions to impose on its visitors.  Members also spoke about the Office of Public Works, OPW, and its failure to perceive itself as being part of the national economic recovery drive or in having a role in welcoming and facilitating visitors.  Perhaps this is more of a failure on the part of the Department of Finance, which is the OPW&rsquo;s parent Department.  It is ironic that although Tourism Ireland managed to persuade historic sites in other countries, including locations in Sydney, Australia, Great Britain and the Statue of Liberty in the United States to celebrate St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day by encouraging visitors to come here, for our own part we do not make our historic sites as welcoming as we ask those in other countries to be.  The problem pertains to attitude and I believe a case exists to make those sites much more commercially orientated by giving them out to the private sector.  While I accept the Office of Public Works does a great job in preservation, conservation and upkeep, I believe such sites should be given out to tender.  I believe this would lead to an operation that would be more commercial and which would see itself as having a role in attracting visitors.</P>
        <P>Members also spoke about costs in the industry.  While I do not have time to discuss them in detail, they spoke primarily about the subject of this motion, the travel tax, because no matter how right we get everything else, it all will be for nothing if people cannot get here <Col N="445"/>easily and cheaply.  The Minister for Finance should note that I was aghast at the complete lack of comprehension displayed by speakers last night and this evening about how this tax affects tourism.  As a direct result of Government action regarding this tax, aeroplanes now fly into Ireland from at least 24 fewer locations than was the case 18 months ago.  Such destinations simply no longer are on the radar for Irish tourism.  They no longer are interested in Ireland and consequently, there is no point in going there to engage in marketing.  For example, when it was about to launch its marketing programme in Germany this year, Tourism Ireland discovered that eight of its target cities had lost their direct flights to Ireland.  I was even more amazed at the lack of insight that informed the Government&rsquo;s counter motion, which &ldquo;considers that the impact of the air travel tax on tourism has been considerably overstated in the context of overall purchasing decisions by visitors&rdquo;.  However, this has nothing to do with the purchasing decisions of visitors.  An Italian or German who tries to book to come here is not even aware of the travel tax.  The travel tax is not paid by visitors and the entire point is that it is paid by airlines that have decided to take their aeroplanes elsewhere to do their business.  That is the impact of travel tax.  I note that Deputy Kennedy tried to point out to me that &euro;10 would not make any difference and the Minister also made the same point.  Deputy Kennedy represents Dublin North, which is where Dublin Airport is located, and I note that Aer Lingus will point out just how price-sensitive are air tickets.  Were this simply a tax on visitors, it would make a difference but the point is that it is not a tax on visitors but is paid by the airlines.</P>
        <P>Various speakers also mentioned that this travel tax applies in other countries.  However, we are the only island that imposes this tax.  Moreover, I might add that Ireland is the only country to impose this tax in the middle of a recession just as tourism figures were collapsing.  We must do better more cheaply and to have better air connections than anyone else if, as an island country, we have aspirations also to be a tourism destination.  It might have been true 18 months ago &mdash; I read the same Department of Finance speech on the International Air Transport Association, IATA, several months ago &mdash; but it is wrong now.  Aviation services in almost every European country are increasing this year, the overall figure being almost 5%.  In some countries, the figure is much higher.  In Ireland, the figure has fallen by 13%.  It is small consolation &mdash; we are looking for consolation now &mdash; that we are only slightly worse than Ukraine, which says it all.  Ryanair and Aer Lingus carried more passengers last year than they did previously.  They are growing passenger numbers.  This is not an international phenomenon.  Rather, it is unique to Ireland.  We are losing passengers while others are not, so it must be something we are doing.</P>
        <P>Given the types of advice and understanding offered yesterday and tonight regarding aviation and tourism, we are a country in big trouble.  It is depressing to hear a word-for-word replica of a speech we heard months ago.  If the Minister doubts what I say or what the airlines are telling us, he should listen to his advisers, namely, the tourism renewal group, the Commission on Taxation, IBEC, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and even the National Competitiveness Council, which have all stated that this tax is damaging Ireland.  Will the Minister please listen to his advisers and get rid of this tax?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise a matter of huge importance to east Galway, where there is grave fear that Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe will be downgraded.  This concern has come to the fore because of a public demonstration to be held next Sunday in St. Michael&rsquo;s Square, Ballinasloe, which I expect will be attended by thousands of people.</P>
        <P>Portiuncula general hospital is important to five or six adjoining counties.  The hospital serves counties Galway, Roscommon, Offaly, Longford and Laois, as well as parts of County Clare and several other areas.  The people served by the hospital want a top-of-the-range surgical hospital with modern accident and emergency facilities and the preservation and extension of the hospital&rsquo;s wonderful maternity unit, which is the jewel in the crown and where a record number of babies were born in the past three years.  The maternity unit is now regarded as one of the most up-to-date maternity facilities.  We also want support for the day care services, cardiology department and all the facilities of a good general hospital.  Not alone do we want to hold services at the hospital.  We want them improved.  We hope that the configuration of hospital services will include Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe at the level I mentioned.</P>
        <P>One of the reasons the unions, many staff members and the general population of the area have become jittery in the past three or four weeks is that the attitude of the HSE seems to be that a new general manager is about to be appointed who will have direct responsibility for the University College Hospital Galway, Merlin Park University Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and Roscommon hospitals.  It is felt rightly or wrongly that under those circumstances Ballinasloe Hospital may be downgraded.</P>
        <P>A matter that seems to be cropping up not only in Ballinasloe Hospital but in many other hospitals concerns the lines of communications from the top to bottom, namely from the HSE down to the various staffing levels.  For some strange reason the HSE is not able to tell everybody concerned the story as it applies to him or her.  There is always a section in an institution such as this that has not been well briefed about its future and people cannot be blamed for <Col N="448"/>thinking the worst if they have not been told exactly what is happening.  I hope that this matter will be addressed.  With all means of communications available today, that should not be a problem.  I spent three or four hours with representatives of the HSE at a meeting of Joint Committee on Health and Children yesterday dealing with the medical card fiasco and I do not believe the people in the HSE are listening to anybody.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell me tonight that this progressive hospital will continue on the graph it is on and that it will continue to provide the professional facilities we all want.  It is a centre of excellence in terms of the service it provides.  University College Hospital Galway is also a centre of excellence in its own right and we are lucky to have the two hospitals where they are located.  I would like a commitment from the Minister of State tonight regarding this hospital, which would prove that the rumours believed by many people in the general area are not correct, but I have to be convinced of that.  When one hears rumours sometimes murky work can be going on behind the scenes about which we do not know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery and maintenance of the best quality health service possible and providing the highest standard of patient care in an effective and efficient way within the resources allocated.  Portiuncula Hospital plays an important part in the HSE West network of acute hospitals and there are no plans to lessen its importance in the provision of services.  It is an acute general and maternity hospital which provides a range of acute, diagnostic and support services to both adults and children in the catchment areas of east Galway, Roscommon, north Tipperary, Offaly and Westmeath.  The hospital has a total of 197 beds &mdash; specifically, 173 inpatient and 24 day care beds.</P>
        <P>Portiuncula Hospital benefits from a committed workforce that, throughout 2010 and in line with the hospital&rsquo;s service plan, is projected to provide services for over 10,000 inpatients, more than 7,000 day cases, 20,000 emergency presentations, 42,000 outpatient attendances and more than 2,000 births.  The hospital also has strong partnerships with colleagues in the primary, community and continuing care sectors in order to provide patients with a fully integrated service.</P>
        <P>The Government has shown its commitment to Portiuncula Hospital in recent years, with capital developments such as the new special care baby unit, the recent upgrading of the emergency department and the overhauling of the oncology day unit and the physiotherapy department in 2007.  This demonstrates that the Government continues to see a very important role for the hospital as part of a high quality health service to the population of the region.</P>
        <P>Work has also been undertaken in recent years to enhance collaboration between Portiuncula Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital in the provision of services.  This is occurring, for example, in the re-configuration that is taking place of the surgical and anaesthetic departments of the two hospitals into a joint department of surgery and anaesthesia.</P>
        <P>The HSE plans to recruit a general manager with responsibility for Galway University Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital.  This initiative involves the expansion of the current post of general manager at Galway University Hospital.  It is designed to promote good co-ordination between hospitals.  It is not about downgrading any hospital or reducing services.  It is about improving management processes and thereby improving services for patients.</P><Col N="449"/>
        <P>The appointment of a general manager with responsibility for the three hospitals concerned is also in line with the approach of the governance of acute hospitals recommended in the Health Information and Quality Authority&rsquo;s report on quality and safety of services at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Ennis, which was published in April 2009.  This report identified integrated governance across hospital networks as an important factor in ensuring higher quality services for patients.</P>
        <P>The HSE is committed to full engagement with all stakeholders in regard to this matter.  The final interviews for the general manager post will not be held until the competition to appoint a regional director of operations in HSE West is concluded.  This means that the regional director can take an active part in the selection process.  I understand this process is due to be concluded shortly.</P>
        <P>The HSE has already met the unions involved to discuss the context of the appointment of the general manager.  It is due to have a further meeting with the unions in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Minister is satisfied that the plan to recruit a general manager with responsibility for Galway University hospitals, Portiuncula Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital will enhance the capacity for collaboration in service provision, provide a more strategic approach to the management of the hospitals concerned and ensure the provision of better and safer services to the people of the region.</P>
        <P>I wish to assure the House on the Minister&rsquo;s behalf that Portiuncula Hospital will continue to play a key role in the provision of hospital services to the population of east Galway and the other areas it serves.</P>

	<P>Since it became known in the south east and south coast regions on Monday of last week that it is proposed to reduce the coastguard search and rescue helicopter service from Waterford Airport to daylight hours only there has been outrage across the board.  The protest against the proposed downgrading of the helicopter service is about safety &mdash; the safety of fishermen, sailors and those involved in sea based and water based leisure activities immediately come to mind.</P>
        <P>The fundamental question is whether the safety of these groups in the south east region and along the south coastline is less important than the safety of similar groups in other parts of the country.  When major emergencies occur at sea, speed can often be the essence in the matter of best outcomes in regard to life and death.  Are the Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard seriously suggesting that in the absence of the search and rescue night-time helicopter service at Waterford Regional Airport seafarers in distress at night along the south east and south coasts can be reached as quickly as with the current 24 hour service?  Why was the fact that many international air routes cross the area within range of Waterford Airport not taken into consideration as part of the risk assessment?</P>
        <P>The decision to downgrade the search and rescue helicopter service at Waterford Regional Airport must be rescinded immediately and I demand that the Minister does just that.  When taken in conjunction with the proposal to close the Waterford-Rosslare railway line, the Minister for Transport appears to be hell-bent on reducing transport provision in the south east while developing services elsewhere.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="450"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>In the absence of the Minister for Transport, I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, to take serious note of this issue.  It is very unusual in an Adjournment debate in this House that the three main parties are represented and speaking off the same hymn sheet with the same concerns.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am one of the people who has been privileged to experience first hand the professionalism of the search and rescue helicopter service coming from Waterford, having been picked up off a boat in fairly rough conditions, and I am convinced that this is a misguided decision.  It will put people&rsquo;s lives in danger and in time will be reversed following a tragedy off the south or south east coast, whether that be 50 miles south of Waterford or off Kinsale or Cork Harbour.  It is not acceptable to have only day time cover for the entire south coast, from Wexford through to Glandore and 50 miles southwards.  These are busy fishing waters with shipping lanes which are used for recreational purposes, including angling and sailing.  It is not true that a helicopter based in Shannon or Dublin could cover this section of water in an adequate time period.  Time is of the essence if a boat is sinking or someone is in the water at night.  Fortunately, a number of lives have been saved in the past two or three years directly as a result of having an active and professional helicopter service based in Waterford.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>To seek to save no more than &euro;1 million per annum in the context of a contract worth &euro;500 million over ten years is irresponsible and will, unfortunately, result in a tragic and unnecessary death off the south coast.  I understand the contract will be signed next week.  I ask the Minister of State to appeal to the Cabinet to reverse its decision before the signing take place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate that I must speak tonight on the Coast Guard helicopter service serving the south east and waters off the south east and south coasts.  This is a vital service for people in counties Cork, Waterford, Wexford and south County Wicklow.  As a Deputy from a county with a strong fishing industry, I am all too aware of the importance of the Coast Guard helicopter service.  A number of fishing tragedies occurred in late 2007 and early 2008, primarily in counties Waterford and Wexford, although a number of boat owners in County Cork were also involved.  At that time, the importance of the service became clear. </P>
        <P>Deputy Coveney is correct that the proposed measure will be reversed when lives are lost.  I cannot believe the Cabinet gave a green light to a recommendation to reduce the Coast Guard helicopter service based at Waterford Airport.  The decision to reduce the service to daylight hours only is a major issue in the affected counties.  It is sad that the Cabinet agreed that lives will be put at risk for the sake of money.</P>
        <P>When I asked how a major tragedy off the Cork, Waterford or Wexford coasts would be handled by emergency helicopters based in Shannon, Sligo or Dublin, I was informed the new fleet of helicopters is 50% faster than the current fleet.  I do not accept this is a solution because having a local service is the best and safest practice.  It is unacceptable that the Waterford based service will be reduced to daylight hours.  A person&rsquo;s life is worth more than the potential savings from the proposal.  A full 24 hour, seven day service would cost an additional &euro;1 million.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to tell the Minister for Transport and his officials that people living along the southern and south eastern coastlines will not accept the Government&rsquo;s decision lying down.  The proposal is a holy scandal and the Minister for Transport must reconsider it.</P>
        <P>I thought members of the Cabinet were considerate individuals.  The decision to reduce the Coast Guard helicopter service in the southern and south eastern coasts is absurd.  I ask the Minister to reverse it before the contract is signed in the days ahead.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="451"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing Deputies to raise this important issue.  I am disappointed, however, that the Minister for Transport is not present to hear our contributions.</P>
        <P>The two lifeboats based in Youghal and Ballycotton in my area work closely with the Coast Guard helicopter service in search and rescue operations.  My colleagues referred to accidents and tragedies.  One of the busiest shipping lanes in the world is located only 50 miles south of Youghal, Knockadoon, Ballymacoda, Ballycotton and Cobh.  Moreover, pleasure boating has increased significantly in recent years and we are hoping to have new marinas in the area shortly.  This is important in light of the strong emphasis on tourism at present.  People become sick and have heart attacks on boats and ships.  Time is, therefore, of the essence.</P>
        <P>I could not believe the news that we would only have a daytime service in the region as a result of the night service being removed from Waterford.  The decision does not make sense.  The crews in Waterford know the region and have trained in the area, which is important in the case of services of this nature.  If the newer helicopters are faster than the current fleet, why not locate them in Waterford and have a 24 hour service in the region?  I understand the new helicopters are smaller and may not be able to carry as many survivors.</P>
        <P>In the matter of saving lives, which is what we are discussing, time is of the essence and minutes count.  Irrespective of whether someone has had a heart attack on a ship or boat or somebody is in the water, it is vital that help arrives as quickly as possible.  I am afraid that this decision, if implemented, which I hope will not be the case, could put lives at risk.  Let us see sense and stop the measure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent days, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has made a number of what could be characterised as insulting or at least dubious comments.  At a road opening a couple of days ago, he stated that the Coast Guard service was the entity that made the recommendation on the helicopter service which went before Cabinet for decision.  That is not true, as we learned in our discussions with representatives of the Coast Guard service a couple of days ago.  They made clear that while they laid out some options for the Department, it was the Department that made the specific recommendation that went to Cabinet.  That is an important point of distinction. </P>
        <P>The Minister also stated the measure would result in a better service.  While it may create a better service for people on the western and northern seaboards and parts of the eastern seaboard, it will certainly not create a better service for the southern and south eastern coastlines.  The important point is that someone who ends up in the water after an accident will have to wait longer for a helicopter to come to his or her rescue.</P>
        <P>The budget for the rescue service contract over ten years has been increased to more than &euro;500 million.  How one can end up with a worse service after increasing the budget demonstrates, without a shadow of a doubt, bad government.</P>
        <P>Deputies debated the Road Traffic Bill this week.  I cannot help but recall the premise cited for introducing the Bill, particularly its provisions on drink-driving.  It was touted in the newspapers week after week that the drink-driving measure would save between one and ten lives every year.  The decision by the Cabinet to remove the 24 hour helicopter rescue service from Waterford will cost lives in the south and south east.  The level of concern shown for road traffic accident victims does not appear to be matched by concern for people in the region affected by the decision.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="452"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I will share time with my colleague from County Waterford, Deputy Brendan Kenneally.</P>
        <P>For many years, people from across the political divide fought to secure a 24 hour helicopter rescue service for Waterford.  Having secured the service in 2004, it is daft that in 2010 we are informed it will be reduced to a 12 hour service.  We have had discussions with officials from the Department on the matter.  When I met the Minister for Transport this evening on a walk through the House, I informed him, as a Fianna F&aacute;il Party Deputy and chairman of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party, that it is unacceptable to Deputies from the south east that this service will be reduced for the sake of achieving savings of &euro;1 million per annum.</P>
        <P>In recent days, the Department informed us that the budget for the emergency rescue service has been increased from &euro;27 million to &euro;52 million.  Despite this increase, people in the south east will suffer because of a shortfall of &euro;1 million.  We are talking about Arklow, Rosslare Europort, major fishing ports, Belmont Harbour and right into Cork, involving probably 1 million people along the coastline.  Only a small amount of money is involved but it is very important to the people of the south east that this service is restored.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, as a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, to bring the message loud and clear to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, and to the Taoiseach, that we want a 24 hour service from 2013, the same as exists at present.  Nothing else is acceptable.  We are entitled to the same service for our people on the south-east coastline as that enjoyed by the people in the west, the south and Dublin.  It is not good enough to say that a helicopter will arrive only nine minutes later because now they are faster, better and more modern, with paramedics on board and all of that.  If a person is in the water, nine minutes is a long time.  This situation should not have to be accepted.  A huge amount of money is being spent in the Department of Transport.  The sum of &euro;1 million per year is a mere pittance and I ask the Minister to reverse this decision.  More important, I ask the Taoiseach to ensure at the next Cabinet meeting, in the ten days before the contract is signed, that we will have our 24 hour service returned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Browne for agreeing to share his time with me.  I agree wholeheartedly with all the previous speakers.  We are discussing health and safety and in my view one cannot put a price on that.  I shall relate a very quick story arising from a telephone call I received from a woman who rang my office and spoke to me about her experience a number of years ago when she was on a ferry leaving Rosslare.  This was before we had the 24 hour service in Waterford.  It was a very rough crossing and unfortunately a man was swept overboard.  The captain was informed immediately and the boat turned around.  It takes a while to turn one of those vessels around.  People could see the man floundering in the water.  He was able to keep swimming for some time but it was too rough to launch a boat to go to him.  The ship could not get too close because it would drag him underneath.  The crew had called for the helicopter, which was not coming from Waterford, but a few minutes before it arrived that man drowned.  He could not keep going any longer.  </P>
        <P>If we do not bring the 24 hour service to Waterford this will happen again and again.  We cannot put a price on health and safety.  At the briefing we had with officials in the Department of Transport last Monday, they told us it would take an extra 9.5 minutes for the helicopter to arrive during the down period in Waterford Regional Airport.  That would have been too late for the man I mentioned and it will be too late for the next person if the same thing happens to somebody on a ferry or a fishing boat or to a person involved in leisure activities.  It is not good enough.</P><Col N="453"/>
        <P>We in the south east give cross-party support to this matter and are as one on it.  We will not stand for the cutback and I hope the Minister of State will bring that message back to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the subject of the search and rescue helicopter service.  There has been much ill-informed comment about the proposed new helicopter contract.  As we are in a standstill period of the procurement process and are about to commence contract negotiations I am somewhat constrained in what can be said.  However, I can make the following points.  The new contract has been presented as a cutback in services.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Far from being a cutback, the contract is a massive half a billion euro investment in maritime search and rescue capability on the island.  The new contract will cost significantly more on an annual basis than the current contract because of the improved service to be provided.  The proposed contract represents a dramatic increase in funding for search and rescue helicopter services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I do not have any copies.  In normal circumstances the ushers circulate copies.  I will undertake to ensure they will be provided to Deputies at the earliest time possible.  I appreciate their flexibility.</P>
        <P>The proposed contract represents a dramatic increase in funding for search and rescue helicopter services in Ireland, from approximately &euro;30 million to &euro;50 million per annum.  This is an increase of &euro;20 million a year for this service alone in difficult circumstances.  The Government has also approved the retention of four helicopter bases, including Waterford, for a period to at leas 2023.  The new contract represents a stepped improvement in the capacity range, speed and capability of Ireland&rsquo;s SAR service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>Was it for a 24 hour service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The existing contract expires on 30 June 2010 but includes a once-off option to extend individual bases flexibly, by different lengths, to a maximum of three years to 30 June 2013.  The Government therefore decided to replace the current flight at a significant additional cost of approximately &euro;20 million per annum.</P>
        <P>Modern helicopters are much more capable than the current aircraft and fly at about 155 knots.  They can lift more people from further out at sea and are usually able to fly in cloud.  They are also more available and dependable, requiring less routine maintenance and are less prone to break down.</P>
        <P>Bidders were required to quote for a number of options by which the target level of service could be provided.  Each of the compulsory options meant that the Coastguard helicopter would reach at least 70% of all incidents within one hour.  The preferred bidder has now been nominated and the Department of Transport is in the standstill period before contract negotiations can begin.  The annual cost will increase very substantially as a result of the provision of modern helicopters.  This increased cost must be found from within the Department of Transport&rsquo;s existing budget over the next ten years.  However, it will deliver a marked improvement in the service.  The new helicopters will fly to the scene of the mission faster, find the vessels or <Col N="454"/>persons in the water more efficiently using better search surveillance and tracking tools, winch them to safety more quickly, provide better medical facilities on board and return them to safety in the shortest time possible.</P>
        <P>I confirm again that there will be no change in the 24 hour availability from the Waterford base from July 2013, if ever.  Furthermore, the future of Waterford Airport as a base for a coastguard SAR helicopter will be cemented until at least 2023.  Although a 12 hour contract is to be negotiated for the post-2013 period the Government is committed to keeping this position under review in the light of the operational requirement at Waterford, the availability of funding and contract negotiations.  To put the 12 hour operation in context, in 2009 this would have required 13 of the 113 missions flown from Waterford to be met from another base.  In some cases the new helicopters would have arrived earlier but, on average, the additional time required would have been about ten minutes.</P>
        <P>At a national level, in difficult financial circumstances, this new contract is a major recognition by the Government of the value of the Irish Coastguard and the communities it serves.  It is also a substantial commitment to the continuing development of Irish maritime safety services.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputies for their understanding.</P>

      <sTitle>Invalid Marriages.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this issue.  It came to public attention about two weeks ago that foreign couples who married in their countries&rsquo; embassies in Ireland had contracted invalid and illegal marriages.  Naturally, this came as a great shock to more than 3,000 non-nationals who had married during the past three years in the embassies of their countries.  Those affected came not only from European Union member states but also from non-EU states.  Everybody who married in a foreign embassy in this country was affected.</P>
        <P>The situation arose from a requirement under the Civil Registration Act, which was passed in 2004 and came into force in November 2007.  From that date onwards there has been a requirement to have an official registrar attend the embassies where marriages take place.  Failing that, under Irish law the marriage is invalid and declared null and void and illegal.  The same situation operates with regard to international law because a marriage must be valid in the country in which it takes place.  This means that even though the foreign nationals may think the marriage is valid in the eyes of their own countries&rsquo; law it cannot be so because the requirements of the country in which the marriage took place have not been fulfilled.</P>
        <P>We have a right legal mess and as a result 3,000 couples find themselves in a complete legal limbo.  In a situation like that all sorts of legal problems are created for the couples and their children.  How can they get their birth certificates registered?  Is there a single parent, or are there two, in terms of the marriage?  How can one deal with the legal issues in that respect?  It seems incredible that it took the best part of three years for the Irish Government to inform the embassies of the legal situation.  I understand it only came to light when the General Register Office wrote to the embassies last month &mdash; approximately three years later &mdash; to inform them of the situation that now exists.</P>
        <P>We have to do our best with the situation, which is as it is.  I understand that complex legislation will be required to remedy this intricate problem.  There is a danger that we will pass legislation that regularises the situation from here on in, without being sure that it regularises the situation that existed in the interim limbo period after these marriage ceremonies were <Col N="455"/>performed.  What are the implications of the actions that have been taken since such ceremonies by couples who were certain they were married, but were not?  They may have entered into numerous contracts, etc.  Some form of retrospective legislative decision-making will have to take place.  That is always very dangerous in constitutional terms.  I would like the Minister of State to tell the House what immediate steps the Government plans to take.  When is it proposed to bring legislation before the House?  Has the Government received the advice of the Attorney General on the ramifications of this problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the House on this issue on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  If a marriage performed in Ireland is to be recognised by Irish law, it must be conducted in accordance with the Civil Registration Act 2004.  This means, among other things, that the marriage must be performed by a registered solemniser under that Act.  Only ordained ministers of religion, or registrars employed by the Health Service Executive, are eligible for registration as solemnisers.  Foreign diplomatic personnel are not eligible under the present law.  While marriages performed by embassies in Ireland have never been recognised in Irish law, they may be recognised in the laws of the states whose embassies perform them.  In international law, a marriage performed at an embassy will be internationally recognised only if it is recognised in the country in which it is performed.  For this reason, a state proposing to perform marriages at its embassies abroad should ideally consult the relevant local authorities in advance to establish whether such marriages will be recognised in all states, or only in the state whose embassy performs the marriage.  As Irish law does not recognise or regulate embassy marriages, we have no statistics on how many such marriages have been performed here.  Under the Vienna Convention, embassies here are obliged to respect Irish laws and regulations, just as Irish embassies abroad are required to respect local laws.  Many countries will not regard as valid a marriage performed by a foreign diplomat or consul in their territory.  This means the marriage would be unlikely to be regarded as valid in any country other than the diplomat&rsquo;s sending State.</P>
        <P>Nothing in Irish law authorises an Irish diplomatic or consular officer to perform a marriage ceremony on the premises of an Irish diplomatic mission.  When it recently came to the attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs that a number of embassies have been performing marriages, the Department contacted the Registrar General and the then Department of Social and Family Affairs and advised all embassies of the requirements of the law governing marriages in Ireland.  A number of embassies recently raised concerns regarding the non-recognition of embassy marriages.  The embassies acknowledged the right of the Irish authorities to regulate this area as they consider appropriate and said no further marriages were being arranged.  However, they were concerned about the position of those who had contracted embassy marriages in the past.  They requested the assistance of the Irish authorities in this respect.  The Department of Foreign Affairs issued a note to all resident embassies in Dublin informing them of the legal requirements for the conduct of marriages in Ireland.  The note stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">There is no provision in the Civil Registration Act for the recognition of diplomatic or consular officers as solemnisers of marriage in Ireland.  Accordingly, marriages performed by diplomatic or consular officers at embassies or any other locations are not recognised in Ireland as valid marriages.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">The matter is being reviewed by the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Foreign Affairs to consider what, if any, assistance can be provided to couples who have encountered <Col N="456"/>practical difficulties as a result of the non-recognition in Irish law of marriages performed at embassies here.  The Department of Foreign Affairs will be in contact with embassies as soon as these consultations have concluded.</P>

	<P>In my response to Question number 75 of 10th February, I indicated that I had asked my Department to provide the information in tabular form. I understand that this has since been provided to Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd and I have asked that the information be also provided to Deputy Reilly.</P>
        <P>In the case of commercial State bodies, the salary scales of chief executives are reviewed from time to time by the Minister for Finance and based on comparisons with posts in the private sector.</P>
        <P>Salary ranges recommended through this system &mdash; known as the &ldquo;Hay Rates&rdquo; &mdash; were last approved by Government in 2007, with a further general sanction by the Department of Finance for revised pay ranges with effect from 1st September 2008.</P>
        <P>In some cases, chief executives are on non-Hay rates. These are primarily cases where chief executives had already been on salaries higher than the Hay rates and opted not to move to a Hay contract.</P>
        <P>Chief Executives of non-commercial State companies and agencies come within the remit of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration and have been subject to the salary reductions provided for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No.2) Act 2009.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance has indicated his concerns about top-level pay across the economy and has moved already in addressing this in the non-commercial sector. He has also confirmed <Col N="458"/>that he will carry out a review of the pay of chief executives of the commercial State companies, including the transport companies. I understand the review is currently under consideration.</P>

	<P>The provision for the rural Transport Programme in 2010 is being maintained at &euro;11m, reflecting the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to the programme, which plays an important role in combating social exclusion in rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>The development of rural transport is also a key objective in the Government&rsquo;s sustainable travel and transport plan, &ldquo;Smarter Travel &mdash; A Sustainable Transport Future&rdquo; and in my Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005.</P>
        <P>On rural transport generally, I have made the point in the House previously that it is important that existing resources in this area are utilised as cost-effectively as possible. In that context a number of initiatives are currently underway in the country exploring the potential for improved synergies between existing transport providers, which include the Health Service Executive for health transport, the Department of Education and Science for school transport, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Pobal for Rural Transport Programme services and other transport providers, such as the Irish Wheelchair Association.</P>
        <P>These initiatives involve pilot transport projects in the North East and North West, an exercise to map all transport services in County Louth and a cross-border pilot rural community transport project under the auspices of the British/Irish Council.  The outcome of these initiatives, as well as recent reports from the Citizens Information Board and the Joint Committee on Arts Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on the matter, will feed into the process for developing rural transport policy into the future.</P>

        <P>There has been much ill informed comment about the proposed new SAR contract. Because we are in the &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; period of the procurement process and about to commence contract negotiations I am somewhat constrained by what I can say.</P>

<P el="5">1. <?oasys _ix ?>The new contract has been presented as a &ldquo;cutback&rdquo; in services; nothing could be further from the truth. The new contract will cost significantly more on an annual basis than the current contract because of the improved services to be provided.</P>

	<P>The consultants appointed by my Department to advise and organise a procurement process relating to the operation of Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport have undertaken their work in two phases.  In the 1st phase, the consultants reported on the design and organisation of a procurement process.  Having accepted the 1st Phase report, I retained the consultants to organise and run the procurement process.  To date the consultants have been paid &euro;699,219.63 (excluding VAT) for work on the 1st and 2nd phases.</P>

        <P>Following the decision to terminate the facilities management procurement process relating to Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport, I announced, on the 10th March, that I was mandating the <Col N="460"/>Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) to operate Terminal 2, while requiring it to demonstrate that it can do so within a benchmark set by the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR).</P>
        <P>In this context the Determination on Dublin Airport Charges for 2010-2014 made by the Commission for Aviation (CAR) in December last year, has set very specific and stringent operating cost targets for operating an efficient Terminal 2.</P>

	<P>I have responded to priority questions relating to the corporate governance of Shannon Foynes Port Company in the House on 9 December and 9 February last.</P>
        <P>My Department carried out a review of corporate governance arrangements in all State bodies under its aegis in 2008. As a result of this I wrote to these bodies, including Shannon Foynes Port Company, outlining new procedures for the monitoring of corporate governance.</P>
        <P>The new procedures include more detailed reporting requirements and annual formal meetings with the management and boards of these bodies.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to monitor Shannon Foynes Port Company&rsquo;s compliance with corporate governance requirements in accordance with these new procedures.</P>
        <P>In 2008, a new chairperson and board were appointed to the company to provide renewed leadership and strategic direction to the company. The chairperson&rsquo;s annual report to the Minister in respect of 2009 will be submitted shortly.</P>
        <P>As stated previously, any correspondence relating to Shannon Foynes Port Company alleging inappropriate corporate behaviour has been brought to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The whole trust of our aviation policy is based on promoting maximum competitiveness and connectivity. We do this by promoting regular, safe cost effective and competitive air services linking the country with key business and tourism markets. I do not perceive that a dominant role for any one carrier would be consistent with this policy as it would militate against competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Development of air services through our airports will be primarily influenced by airlines&rsquo; perception of market potential and the attractiveness and the competitiveness of the services on offer at our airports. Commercial decisions on specific air services to and from our airports are essentially a matter for airlines. A key objective of airports policy is to ensure that the three State Airports have sufficient capacity to provide vital international access and to respond to a competitive airline sector. Dublin Airport is our major airport and offers a wide range of shorthaul and longhaul services to locations that are important to our trade and tourism development. As an economically regulated Airport, DAA&rsquo;s role is to manage Dublin Airport efficiently and cost effectively and to undertake necessary investment for the future. DAA&rsquo;s current &euro;1.2 billion investment programme will strengthen the capacity of the Airport to serve the needs of existing and future airline users.</P>
        <P>While decisions about aircraft servicing at Dublin Airport are mainly a matter for the airlines and enterprises involved, I can assure the Deputy that State Agencies and relevant Government Departments recognise and support  the job creation potential of such activities. I would refer the Deputy to the DAA Statement of the 24th February to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport which sets out in detail its position on the use of hangars at Dublin Airport.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government of 2007 made a commitment to conduct feasibility studies into Luas-type light rail systems in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  I subsequently asked the local authorities in these cities, which have responsibility for these studies, to see that the feasibility of Bus Rapid Transit systems was simultaneously taken into account.  These studies have been completed or are close to completion in all four cities.  </P>
        <P>The Final Report on the Galway Public Transport Feasibility Study was adopted by the City Council at its meeting on the 8th March 2010.  The report concluded that Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is the recommended solution for Galway City.</P>
        <P>The recommendation for a BRT system is accompanied by a range of complementary measures that are necessary to facilitate the provision of BRT in Galway City.</P>
        <P>The Study examined all options for the future development of public transport in Galway, and included an assessment of the Gluas proposal.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Members of the City Council expressed a preference for a light rail system (LRT) for Galway, and also that the City Council would work with the Gluas group to explore issues which arose in the context of its proposal.  I understand that the City Council will examine mechanisms to progress these issues and also to progress the development of the improved transport system for Galway as recommended in the Study and endorsed by the City Council.</P>
        <P>I will await the outcome of those deliberations by the City Council before concluding my consideration of the Study. Pending this it would be premature to speculate on a public private partnership or any other delivery mechanism.</P>

	<P>The &ldquo;Guidelines for Accessible Maritime Passenger Transport&rdquo; were drawn up by my Department in conjunction with the National Disability Authority (NDA), on foot of a recommendation in the Report of the Maritime Passenger Transport Forum, published in November 2008. The Forum was established to oversee implementation of the maritime section of the Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005, and is made up of representatives from organisations representing people with disabilities, passenger ship and port services providers, relevant Departments and the NDA. </P>
        <P>The Guidelines contain a range of practical advice and information and are designed as a key support to those involved in providing maritime passenger transport services. They cover all aspects of a journey, including advice on providing accessible information for planning the journey, improving access on board vessels, making shore side facilities accessible, disability awareness training for staff and improving communications with passengers.</P>
        <P>This is the first time that such guidelines for the maritime sector have been produced in Ireland. Copies are being sent to maritime passenger transport service providers who are being asked to use them to review their services with a view to improving access to their customers.</P>
        <P>As the Guidelines have only just been published, it is not my intention at this stage to introduce legislation to accompany them. However, how they are being used by vessel operators will be reviewed in due course and if found necessary consideration will be given to introducing statutory requirements. In this regard, I have taken the opportunity in the Merchant Shipping Bill 2009, to strengthen my powers to introduce measures to facilitate access to passenger vessels to persons with reduced mobility. The Bill recently passed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>Industrial relations at Aer Lingus are entirely a matter for the board, management and staff of Aer Lingus. The industrial relations machinery of the State remains available to assist the parties where difficulties exist.</P>
        <P>The duties of the three Government appointed directors to the board of Aer Lingus derive from the Companies Acts and, as such, the directors are obliged to pursue the best interests of the company. Subject to that duty, the three Government appointed directors are mandated to seek to ensure that all decisions of the company that have significant implications for wider Government, aviation or regional development policies are considered at board level. In any such decisions they are directed to seek to reconcile commercial and public policy objectives.</P>
        <P>The Government is satisfied, from all of the information available to it, that a major restructuring of the Group&rsquo;s cost base is essential if Aer Lingus is to return to profitability and growth.  From an aviation policy perspective, the Government wants to see a strong viable Aer Lingus <Col N="466"/>in the future. The cornerstones of Government aviation policy are competitiveness and connectivity and a viable Aer Lingus is key to ensuring the achievement of these objectives.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, 130, 133 and 141 to 143, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="467"/>
        <P>Very substantial progress has been made on Transport 21 and the National Development Plan: the five major inter-urban motorways (totalling over 740 kilometres) will be completed this year, as will the M50 upgrade; the Irish Rail inter-city fleet has been renewed with the delivery and entry into service of 244 carriages and railcars; the Midleton rail line opened for service in 2009 and the first phase of the Western Rail Corridor will open at the end of this month and the first phase of the Navan line will open later in the year; the Kildare railway line has been upgraded and a number of new stations have opened on the Dublin suburban network; the Luas extension to Docklands opened last December, the Cherrywood extension will open at the end of this year and Citywest early next year.  All the trams on the Tallaght line have been extended to 40 metres and new trams have been purchased; and over 500 new and replacement buses have been purchased.</P>
        <P>In the light of the changed economic circumstances, it has been necessary to review investment priorities across all Government Departments. The results of this review are reflected in the Renewed Programme for Government and my Department&rsquo;s Transport 21 priorities for the coming years are as follows.  For national roads, the priorities are the completion by end 2010 of the five major inter-urban motorways and the M50 upgrade and the progression of the Atlantic Road Corridor.  For public transport, the priority is to deliver significantly increased long term capacity to the network through: the construction of Metro North; the construction of DART Underground and the implementation of the associated electrification, signalling and rolling stock investments; and investment in buses, bus priority and real time passenger information, subject to the implementation of the recent cost efficiency reviews and the availability of subvention.  It is also a priority that we continue planning other projects to enable their earliest possible delivery when the economic situation improves.</P>
        <P>Funding for the period ahead will be decided by the Government having regard to the capital review carried out by the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>It is unlikely that all of the projects originally identified in Transport 21 will be completed by 2015. However, no projects have been cancelled and Transport 21 continues to provide the strategic framework for capital spending on transport infrastructure into the future.</P>
        <P>Projects will be released by construction having regard to the priorities in the Renewed Programme for Government and the availability of funding.</P>

	<P>When a vehicle is subject to a recall due to a defect which could endanger safety, manufacturers and distributors endeavour to contact all registered owners with the assistance of data from my Department&rsquo;s National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF). During 2009 the NVDF provided details on 170,712 vehicles covering 82 recall events and to date in 2010 details have been supplied in respect of 35,000 vehicles for 17 recalls. Recall details in respect of earlier years are not currently available due to industrial action. </P>
        <P>It will be noted that there may also be some recall events where NVDF data is not required because manufacturers have ownership particulars from their own records.</P><Col N="468"/>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 103 together.</P>
        <P>The Integrated Ticketing project is being introduced in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) on a phased basis, based on smartcard technology. A progressive approach is being adopted to allow customers to familiarise themselves with using the new system and to permit transport operators to undertake the necessary testing with the integration of the technologies involved.  The project is now firmly in the implementation phase and extensive testing of elements of the system is already underway.</P>
        <P>The system will be progressively rolled out over the coming months on Dublin Bus and Luas services, such that, by end-2010, smartcards with a &ldquo;pay-as-you-go&rdquo; function will be available to some 75% of public transport customers in the GDA.  Private bus operators are also participating in the scheme and it is anticipated that a number of these operators, along with DART and commuter rail services and Bus &Eacute;ireann on a pilot basis, will join the scheme throughout 2011.</P>
        <P>The project remains on target to deliver real and tangible benefits to public transport users on a progressive basis during 2010. However, in a project involving numerous organisations, and where there are many business and technical complexities, there are and will continue to be difficulties that will pose challenges to all participants in delivering on the agreed programme. This has also been the experience internationally. The experience to date is that the Project Board is working well and in a manner that allows them to meet these challenges as they arise.</P>
        <P>Since 1st December 2009, Real Time Passenger Information is a matter which comes under the remit of the National Transport Authority (NTA).</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dublin Bus recently briefed me on the deterioration in the financial position of the company due to declining demand and revenue and increased costs in the current difficult economic climate.  The company also outlined its intention to take a number of actions to restore its financial viability.  Principal amongst these actions is the implementation of the network changes recommended by Deloitte in its cost and efficiency review of Dublin Bus.  These network changes will ensure the efficient provision of quality bus services.</P>

	<P>The non-payment of tolls and penalties arising from road traffic offences incurred by out of State vehicles has been a matter of concern <Col N="471"/>for some time. To address this issue in a North/South context, discussions between my Department and its UK and Northern Ireland counterparts resulted in an agreement to introduce a data exchange pilot project with Northern Ireland. This involves the transfer of vehicle ownership data which will allow the authorities in each jurisdiction to identify people who have not paid tolls or traffic penalties. It will then be a matter for the relevant authorities to pursue recovery of the outstanding amounts using this information. No change in the law is involved, nor does the agreement cover arrangements for the recovery of payments. </P>
        <P>The pilot project was launched at the North South Ministerial Council meeting on 3 March, and will run until the end of November this year.</P>
        <P>The technical systems involved have been fully tested and are in readiness for live operation. It is expected that the process of exchanging the data between the relevant vehicle registration and licensing authorities in both jurisdictions will commence shortly. As the exchange process will rely largely on technical systems already in place there will be no ongoing additional cost.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  </P>
        <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in Parliamentary Question 125 of 24 November, 2009, I can confirm that my Department received an application for a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on 5 November, 2009 in respect of the person concerned which is still awaiting processing.</P>
        <P>In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements as in this case, the Section is, in general processing claims dating from August 2009 so that the current waiting time for processing claims is generally 7 months.  In the interests of equity to all claimants, claims are processed in order of date of receipt.</P>
        <P>The unprecedented influx of redundancy claims received by my Department since the latter end of 2008 and which is continuing, has placed considerable pressure on the Department&rsquo;s ability to process claims in an acceptable timeframe.  In 2009, a total of 50,664 claims were processed, up 70% on 2008 levels, and corresponding payments totalling &euro;336m were made which results in average weekly payments to the value of &euro;6.5m being issued.  In the period 2007-2009, the level of new claims lodged with my Department has increased cumulatively by 200%.  This contrasts with the previous two-year period 2005-2007 in which period the increase in new claims lodged was just 10%.</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;</P><Col N="474"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The T&aacute;naiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and it is clear that additional measures are required to help reduce the backlog of claims which currently stands in excess of 39,000.  The Department is actively engaged in efforts to secure up to 16 additional staff resources to be deployed to the area in the first half of 2010.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In October 2009 Aer Lingus announced details of a cost savings programme aimed at reducing operating costs by &euro;97 million, comprising staff savings of &euro;74 million and non-staff cost savings of &euro;23 million.</P>
        <P>Following four months of intense negotiation between Aer Lingus management and Unions, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, the resulting joint agreements were put to Aer Lingus staff with a recommendation for acceptance by each of the respective unions. The results of the ballots were that the plan was accepted by four out of the five unions involved. Cabin crew rejected the plan by a 2:1 majority. Aer Lingus subsequently announced their plans to achieve the necessary cost savings.</P>
        <P>As a result of further discussions at the Labour Relations Commission on 19 March, during which clarifications on the cost saving plan were given, a general meeting of union members decided on Monday 22nd March to hold another ballot of all cabin crew on the restructuring package. Balloting commenced on Tuesday 23rd March.</P>
        <P>The Government is satisfied, from all of the information available to it, that a major restructuring of the Group&rsquo;s cost base is essential if Aer Lingus is to return to profitability and growth. The cost base of Aer Lingus is seriously out of line with that of its competitors.  Airlines throughout the world are either rationalising or going out of business as a result of the global economic downturn.</P>
        <P>The Government want to see a strong viable Aer Lingus in the future. The cornerstones of Government aviation policy are competitiveness and connectivity.  A viable Aer Lingus is key to ensuring the achievement of these objectives.</P>

        <Quest> if a person who received a gift or inheritance under the then capital acquisitions tax threshold in a given category is liable for capital acquisitions tax; and if the threshold is subsequently adjusted below the value of the gift or inheritance due to consumer price index indexation. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Capital Acquisitions Taxation (CAT) applies to gifts and inheritances.  The relationship between the person who provided the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who received the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary) determines the tax-free threshold below which CAT does not apply on the gifts or inheritances.  There are three tax-free thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer and these tax-free thresholds are indexed annually by reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  The tax free thresholds for 2010 are: Group A (gifts or inheritances from parents to their children), &euro;414,799; Group B (gifts/inheritances to grandchildren, siblings, nephews, nieces or to parents), &euro;41,481; and Group C (all other persons), &euro;27,127.</P>
        <P>In the case of a gift, the tax-free threshold that applies is the specific tax-free threshold for the year in which the gift is received.  In the case of an inheritance, the tax-free threshold that applies is the specific tax-free threshold for the year in which the disponer died (subject to a number of exceptions in the areas of trusts and settlements).</P>
        <P>If the value of the gift or inheritance is below the specific relevant tax-free threshold for the year in question when prior benefits are also taken into account, then no tax is payable.  If the tax-free thresholds are subsequently adjusted downwards in the following year due to a fall in the CPI and below the value of the gift or inheritance, this has no impact on the tax position of the beneficiary because the tax-free thresholds that apply to the beneficiary are, as stated, the specific tax-free thresholds for the year in which the gift is received or in which the disponer died and these tax-free thresholds are fixed at those points in time.</P>

	<P>I have responsibility for implementation of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which was introduced in January of this year. </P>
        <P>The ECCE makes a number of provisions to facilitate children with disabilities and special needs.  The upper age limit is waived where children have been assessed as being developmentally delayed or where they have a physical, sensory or mental condition which will result in them starting school at a later than normal age.  Provision is also made to enable children who have been assessed as having a disability, and who would benefit from attending pre-school for 2/3 days rather than 5 days each week, to be eligible over 2 years, for example 2 days in year 1 and 3 days in year 2.  To avoid delays for parents, in addition to assessments by the Health Service Executive (HSE) for children with special needs and/or disabilities, at this point assessments provided by the treating consultant will be accepted as evidence of developmental delay and/or disability.</P>
        <P>In addition, where children have been assessed as having a disability which will result in them starting school at a later than normal age, the provision of a second free pre-school year, on a non pro-rata basis, will be considered where this will be of particular benefit to them.  Parents of children who have availed of the pre-school year in January 2010 and have an assessed disability which will result in them starting school at a later than normal age, should apply to the Childcare Directorate of my Office where they wish their child to be considered for a 2nd pre-school year in September 2010.

	<P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to <Col N="477"/>ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted. </P>
        <P>Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia in respect of adoption. Consideration of this matter is at an early stage.</P>
        <P>I brought forward at Committee stage an amendment to the Adoption Bill 2009 that will enable prospective adoptive parents to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague or non-bilateral country, if prior to the establishment date, they have been issued with a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt. The proposed amendment requires that the Adoption Authority (to be set up under the Act) would be satisfied that the particular adoption meets all the standards of the Hague Convention. Following the Committee stage debate I am also giving consideration to the possibility of including the three month &lsquo;cooling off&rsquo; period provided for in the ratification process for the Hague Convention in the transitional provision.</P>
        <P>The HSE and the Adoption Board are both aware of the deadlines associated with the transitional measure and are making every effort to process applications on hand for Declarations of Eligibility and Suitability to Adopt prior to commencement of the legislation.</P>

	<P>I have responsibility for implementation of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which was introduced in January of this year. </P>
        <P>One condition of the scheme is that children must be aged between 3 years and 3 months, and 4 years and 6 months in the September at the start of the pre-school year.  My office has interpreted this condition as generously as possible, to allow children who are in the age range for even one day during September enter the scheme, which means that  children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 will be eligible next September, effectively a 17 month age range.  The Department of Education &amp; Science inform my Office that approximately half of children commence Junior Infants following their fifth birthday, and those who commence school before then are generally older four year olds.</P>
        <P>I am also informed that it would be extremely rare for a child to commence school before their fourth birthday, and that a number of schools do not take children before their 5th birthday, and a greater number require the child to have reached their 4th birthday in advance of the preceding Summer holidays.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As stated in the original documentation regarding the scheme, exceptions may be made to this condition for older children, where (a) the child has Special Needs, which make later enrolment more appropriate, or (b) local schools enrolment policies require the child to start Junior Infants aged 5 years 7 months or older.  There has never been provision to provide an exemption for children under the qualifying age, and it is not proposed to introduce one at this stage.</P>
        <P>The returns made by services indicate that the average age of a child in the scheme would have been 3 years and 10 months old in the September at the start of the pre-school year.</P>
        <P>My Office received a letter earlier this month from the person named, seeking an exemption from the above rule in respect of her daughter, who was born on 16 August 2007, as she wishes to avail of the scheme from next September.  I regret, however, that as outlined, such an exemption is not allowed for under the scheme, and her eligibility will arise from 1 September 2011, i.e. 16 days after her 4th birthday, making her two months older than the average age in the scheme, rather than the 10 months younger she would be if the rules of the scheme were amended to accommodate enrolment in September 2010.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 to 137, inclusive, 139 and 140 together.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the cost restructuring plan at Aer Lingus is entirely for the Board, Management and Staff of the company and it is not open to the Government to intervene.  The industrial relations machinery of the State remains available to assist the parties where diffi<Col N="482"/>culties exist.  Indeed, the Labour Relations Commission recently intervened to invite the parties to separate talks on 19th March.  Arising from those talks, I understand that IMPACT is to ballot cabin crew members again on the company&rsquo;s cost restructuring plan which the four other groups at the company had voted to accept.</P>
        <P>The duties of the three Government appointed directors to the board of Aer Lingus derive from the Companies Acts and, as such, the directors are obliged to pursue the best interests of the company.  Subject to that duty, the three Government appointed directors are requested to seek to ensure that all decisions of the company that have significant implications for wider Government, aviation or regional development policies are considered at board level.  In<?oasys _jy ?>any such decisions they are directed to seek to reconcile commercial and public policy objectives.</P>
        <P>From an aviation policy perspective, the Government wants to see a financially stable and viable Aer Lingus competing in the Irish air transport market.  The cornerstones of Government aviation policy are competitiveness and connectivity.  A viable Aer Lingus is key to ensuring the achievement of these objectives.  I note that the Question relating to the impact on the Social Insurance Fund is also directed to my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade &amp; Innovation, who will address the Question insofar as it relates to his remit.  The restructuring of Aer Lingus has no bearing on Transport 21 projections.</P>

CAR&rsquo;s detailed report of 4th December 2010 on the Dublin Airport charges determination is available on its website (www.aviationreg.ie).  Charges at Cork and Shannon are set by the airport authority. Passenger charges levied at the six regional airports, which are owned and operated independently, are a matter for each airport concerned.</P>
        <P>In relation to comparative charges at other European Airports, I have been informed by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) that independent research indicates that charges at Dublin are towards the lower end of a broad comparison group of the top airports in Europe.  I also understand from the DAA that charges at Cork and Shannon are competitive and compare favourably with UK benchmarks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The non-payment of tolls and penalties arising from road traffic offences incurred by out of State vehicles has been a matter of concern for some time. To address this issue in a North/South context, discussions between my Department and its UK and Northern Ireland counterparts resulted in an agreement to introduce a data exchange pilot project with Northern Ireland. This involves the transfer of vehicle ownership data which will allow the authorities in each jurisdiction to identify people who have not paid tolls or traffic penalties. It will then be a matter for the relevant authorities to pursue recovery of the outstanding amounts using this information. No change in the law is involved, nor does the agreement cover arrangements for the recovery of payments. The pilot project was launched at the North South Ministerial Council meeting on 3 March, and will run until the end of November this year.</P>
        <P>The technical systems involved have been fully tested and are in readiness for live operation. It is expected that the process of exchanging the data between the relevant vehicle registration and licensing authorities in both jurisdictions will commence shortly. As the exchange process will rely largely on technical systems already in place there will be no ongoing additional cost.</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />and  awareness of social inclusion.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There are over 1,300 Community Alert schemes in operation throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Community Alert Schemes operate under a strategy which covers the period 2007 to 2011 and was launched by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in October, 2007.  The strategy was developed following a root and branch review of the programme by a sub committee of the Community Alert Management Committee, which consisted of representatives of Muintir na T&iacute;re, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Development Officers.  The review took account of the social and demographic changes that have taken place since 1985.</P>
        <P>In recent years my Department has provided funding to Muintir na T&iacute;re for the Community Alert Programme of &euro;150,000 in 2004, &euro;120,000 in 2005, &euro;175,000 in 2006, &euro;200,000 in 2007, &euro;200,000 in 2008 and &euro;200,000 in 2009.

Since its establishment, the Garda authorities have sought to encourage the active participation of the public in Neighbourhood Watch by encouraging and supporting communities to establish and maintain such initiatives and deploying crime prevention officers and liaison Garda&iacute; to assist schemes.  </P>
        <P>Neighbourhood Watch continues to operate under the Neighbourhood Watch Strategy 2007-2011, which has helped to strengthen its management and operation.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, a general review of the immigration regime for non-EEA students is underway at present.  Following publication of a discussion paper on 1 September 2009 and a public consultation process, an Interdepartmental Committee chaired by my Department has been drawing up final recommendations.   I expect to receive the Committee&rsquo;s report shortly.  The discussion paper had indicated that a separate exercise over a longer timeframe would be carried out by this Committee in relation to the student work concession.   When I have received the Committee&rsquo;s report on the overall reform of student immigration and reviewed its recommendations I will consider further when the Committee should carry out its review of the work concession.        </P>

	<P>Representations have been made to me concerning alleged deals of the kind instanced by the Deputy in her question.  However, I have no direct knowledge of such deals as the establishment of the conditions associated with a business tenancy is essentially a private matter between the parties to the contract.  </P>
        <P>The concern expressed in relation to this matter  was one of the factors which led me to establish a Working Group to examine the question of transparency in rent reviews.  The terms of reference of the Working Group are as follows: &ldquo;To consider the operation of the current system for determining the rent payable on foot of a rent review clause, with particular emphasis on the arbitration process and the adequacy of the information available to all parties and, if necessary, to make such recommendations for change as may seem appropriate.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the Group will report by 30 June 2010.</P>
        <P>In relation to the general issue of competitiveness, it is obviously the case that every effort must be made, by all relevant parties, to ensure that all our cost pressures are kept under control.  This applies in relation to the area of commercial rents in much the same way as it applies in relation to areas which fall directly within Government control.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware the Passport Service is currently experiencing disruption to services caused by ongoing industrial action throughout the public service. This industrial action has curtailed the flexibility previously available in delivering passport services. On 4 March the Department of Foreign Affairs advised passport customers through the press and on the Passport Service website that the public counters and out of hours services should only be used by those who have a necessity to travel for reasons of family emergency. Additionally it was explained that it would not be possible to fast-track any application other than in a case of genuine family emergency. A definition of travel in respect of a genuine family emergency was further defined as that travel necessitated by the death, illness or welfare of a family member. In the case of this applicant the circumstances of genuine family emergency did not apply and therefore it was not possible to fast-track the application.  Passport customers are advised to send their applications through the An Post Passport Express service where current turnaround times are approximately fifteen &mdash; twenty working days. </P>

	<P>US military actions in Afghanistan were not discussed during the meetings which the Taoiseach and I had with President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton in Washington last week.  Discussion of Afghanistan focussed on food security and police training, where Ireland is prepared to make a direct contribution. In addition, both the President and the Secretary of State thanked Ireland for the contribution <Col N="490"/>of the seven Defence Force personnel who carry out non-combat Headquarters duties with the UN-mandated ISAF force.</P>
        <P>Over the decades, invasions and civil war have exacted a very heavy toll on the lives of innocent Afghan civilians. Before and after the Taliban came to power in 1996, they and their associates were the primary perpetrators of killings and crimes against Afghan civilians. However, in the nine years since the beginning of ISAF&rsquo;s operations in Afghanistan in 2001, the high numbers of Afghan civilians being killed by international troops reflected a failure on the part of ISAF to prioritise adequately the protection of ordinary Afghans. This failure helped to fuel radical sentiment within Afghanistan. Fortunately, the international military forces have recently been taking steps to ensure enhanced protection of Afghani civilians.</P>
        <P>The new ISAF and US strategy includes a range of measures to consult, involve, protect and support the local communities where military operations are taking place.  Greater priority is being accorded in current military operations in Afghanistan to the protection of civilian lives and the ending of inadvertent killings by the international forces. However, I deeply regret each and every civilian casualty, and wish to see every effort made to avoid death and suffering among the civilian population in Afghanistan.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P>As of December 2009, the most up to date information available, the number of persons in receipt of rent supplement who are less than twenty years of age is 1,359. This represents 1.5% of the total number of persons currently benefitting from the scheme. Due to industrial action this analysis cannot be provided on a county basis.</P>

	<P>The Department&rsquo;s back to work enterprise schemes are designed to assist people on a social welfare payment return to work by setting up a self-employment business.</P>
        <P>Prior to the 1st May 2009, the back to work enterprise allowance was a four year scheme under which eligible participants who set up a business retained 100% of their social welfare payment in year one, 75% in year two, 50% in year three and 25% in year four.</P>
        <P>At the end of April 2009, there were 4,225 people in receipt of the allowance.  From the 1st May 2009, the duration of the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance was reduced from 4 years to 2 years at 100% of existing social welfare entitlement in the first year and 75% in the second year. The qualifying period was reduced from 24 months to 12 months, provided a person has an underlying entitlement to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance.  At the end of February 2010 there were 4,909 participants in the back to work enterprise allowance; 1,443 under the 2-year scheme and 3,466 carried over from the 4-year cycle.</P>
        <P>A new Short Term Enterprise Allowance scheme was introduced from the 1st May 2009 for people who are entitled to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and have been awarded statutory redundancy or have paid full rate PRSI contributions as an employee for at least two years prior to their claim to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit. This new scheme can be accessed immediately and is payable for the duration of their Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit entitlement while they are establishing their enterprise.

	<P>The Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 proposes to give statutory effect to the recommendations of the Working Group that reviewed the management of dog breeding establishments.  The Bill defines a dog breeding establishment as a premises with not less than 6 bitches of 4 months old capable of breeding.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes that all dog breeding establishments be required to register with the relevant local authority, and that they pay a registration fee and meet a minimum set of veterinary, welfare and other standards, together with some associated requirements.</P>
        <P>The Hunting Association of Ireland (HAI) made submissions to me in relation to their activities and the nature of these.  As a consequence and in recognition of the &ldquo;not for profit&rdquo; basis of these activities, I decided to provide an exemption in the legislation in respect of the payment of registration fees.  The HAI has made it clear that their premises operate in accordance with comprehensive and appropriate voluntary standards.  Accordingly, I do not consider that this aspect of the proposed legislative regime should cause difficulty to their members.</P>
        <P>Regulations will be introduced following enactment of the Bill and will set out the detailed criteria for dog breeding establishments.  Guidelines for dog breeding establishments to meet <Col N="495"/>the requirements of the legislation will be introduced by way of Regulations following enactment of the Bill.

	<P>The Parliamentary Question referred to by the Deputy concerns the payment of the second instalment of 40 per cent due to farmers under the Farm Waste Management Scheme.  Total expenditure under the Scheme in 2009 was &euro;292.76 million which included expenditure of &euro;49 million in respect of the second instalment of grant-aid to 3,683 farmers.  Expenditure under the Scheme, to date in 2010, has been &euro;194.3 million comprised mainly of further payments of the second instalment <Col N="497"/>of grant-aid due to farmers under the Scheme.  The final instalment of grant-aid will be paid to farmers in 2011.</P>
        <P>In a small number of cases (estimated at substantially less than 1 per cent), no grant payment has yet been approved for applicants under the Scheme (i) as applicants have not yet submitted the necessary tax clearance documentation or have not provided the required documentary proof of payment of the contractors concerned, or (ii) due to technical issues having arisen in relation to the standard of the completed buildings.</P>

Existing legislation will also be updated to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals, is properly protected and that the penalties for offenders are increased significantly. The Bill will provide any necessary statutory basis to give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government that responsibility for welfare of all animals (including non-farm animals) be consolidated in my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), where schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P>
        <P>NEPS in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is <Col N="499"/>a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a student be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more students indirectly than could be seen individually.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the General Allocation model for primary schools in 2005/06 means that children with high incidence special needs can get access to extra support without having to undergo an individual assessment.</P>
        <P>Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term. Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist.</P>
        <P>In the case of schools that do not currently have dedicated NEPS psychologists assigned to them, as I already mentioned, such schools have access to psychological assessments through the SCPA. Under this Scheme, schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologist concerned.</P>
        <P>I have made enquiries with my Department&rsquo;s local NEPS service in Ennis, Co Clare and am informed that they have not been made aware of a backlog of cases awaiting assessment in the school mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s query.</P>
        <P>Furthermore I can confirm to the Deputy that the expansion of the NEPS service has been excepted from the stricture of the moratorium on recruitment in the public service and my government has made specific commitment within the Renewed Programme for Government to an overall expansion of NEPS psychologist numbers to 210 &mdash; current NEPS staffing numbers stand at 156.</P>
        <P>In this regard a national recruitment competition has been recently launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of my Department with a view to the creation of a panel of suitably qualified psychologists to enable the employment of these additional staff as quickly as possible. The NEPS Mid-West Region will be a target for this recruitment drive.</P>
        <P>In the interim should authorities, in the school referred to by the Deputy, have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing I would suggest that they should contact the relevant local NEPS Regional Director, for whom contact details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 provides for the establishment of the Special Education Appeals Board to hear and determine appeals under the act. The <Col N="502"/>appellant sections of the Act which have not yet been commenced are: Sections 3 (13), 4(7), 6 (1), 7(5), 10(3) (6), 11(6), 12(1a), 12(1b) and 39(5). These sections if commenced would provide for appeals to be taken by parents, principals or boards of managements of schools on a range of issues as stated in the relevant sections.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the commitment in the renewed Programme for Government is to develop, in consultation with stakeholders, a costed multi-annual plan to implement some priority aspects of the EPSEN Act, focussing on measurable, practical progress in education and health services for children with special needs. All parts of the EPSEN legislation, which have not been commenced to date, will be considered during this process.</P>
        <P>Since its establishment, the Board has developed draft procedures which could be used to consider appeals once the relevant sections of the EPSEN Act are commenced. In considering the requirements of the appeals process which would be required under EPSEN, the Board members have examined the range of legal issues associated with such a process. In this context they have also reviewed the outcome of judicial reviews of education decisions and looked at the structures and procedures in other tribunal fora. Costs associated with approved appeals procedures will also be included in implementation estimates.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> the number of appeals from parents and schools regarding special education needs organiser decisions and special needs assistants allocations which have been received by the National Council for Special Education since its internal appeals process began on 22 February 2010; if parents and schools who are unhappy with SENO decisions made prior to 22 February 2010 will have the opportunity to appeal these decisions using the same appeals process; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the issues he has raised are an operational matter for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  My Department does not keep a record of such activity.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to raise these issues directly with the NCSE.</P>
