    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32</Title>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32.  I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of national importance, namely, the urgent need to support the right to aftercare for young people leaving State care and to include a legal entitlement to aftercare in the Child Care (Amendment) Bill as this is one of the key recommendations of the Ryan report on child abuse, recommendation No. 17, and calls on the Government to make this a priority issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of local and national importance, namely, the urgent need for a full debate on the medical card means test and regulation.  Many extremely needy cases are being cut off under the current review and in one case it meant a person could no longer afford his medication from January last.  He became seriously ill in March and the taxpayer has had to bear the expense of both his hospitalisation and ongoing social welfare.  This system must be re-evaluated so the community welfare officers can have more leeway to deal with circumstances as they see them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the threat by the Government to cut the old age pension, which will adversely impact on elderly people already struggling to make ends meet in the recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>We will worry about the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This is indicative of the extraordinary attitude of a government that has no regard for the frail and old, which has been demonstrated in the effort to remove automatic entitlement to medical cards for the over 70s, cutting home help hours, closing care homes such as Loughloe House, Athlone, the threat to St. Mary&rsquo;s care centre, Mullingar, County Westmeath, and now potentially cutting the well earned pensions of our elderly citizens, which is leading to great anger.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Government to help urgently the 20,000 householders whose homes are beginning to collapse around them because of the presence of defect pyrite in the foundations of their home. The Government needs to urgently set aside a fund to help those home owners who are suffering hardship, badly affected by this scandal and are not getting any help from their builder or their builder&rsquo;s insurer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the continued recruitment embargo in the HSE and the Department of Health and Children which is putting people&rsquo;s lives at risk throughout the country.  In my own area the Plunkett home in Boyle has 100 elderly citizens who are still being denied day care services despite numerous Government commitments and political promises to reinstate the services three weeks ago.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is proposed to take No. <i>a</i>13, motion re report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on parliamentary standards; No. 1, Inland Fisheries Bill 2009 &mdash; amendments from the Seanad; No. 2, Fines Bill 2009 &mdash; amendments from the Seanad; No. 20, Nurses and Midwives Bill 2010 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 21, statements on diversification of primary school provision, to be taken not later than 1 p.m., and the order shall not resume thereafter.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. <i>a</i>13 shall be decided without debate; and the proceedings on No. 21 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. today and the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case, the statements of each other member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case, Members may share time and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two proposals to put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. <i>a</i>13, motion re report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on parliamentary standards agreed to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very serious and important matter which should be taken on board by every Member.  Does this mean we will see changes in Standing Orders?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, there will be a change in Standing Orders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the proposals come before the House?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="755"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The starting point is the adoption of the report.  A new Standing Order will be prepared.  I hope the report will be adopted this morning and we will then move on to the preparation of the new Standing Order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Which comes first?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope it will help in getting some order in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I was unavoidably absent from the meeting of the committee where this earth-shattering report was presented and adopted.  I do not think it will have any effect whatever on the business of this House or the way we conduct that business.  It is a report of nothing.  The committee which prepared it sat for long hours and created a large file in the process.  There is nothing in this report worth talking about except an attempt to stifle debate in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is nothing new.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I am unsure of its value.  I accept that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, is recommending it, but I would like a debate in the House when the Standing Orders arising from it are being made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of clarification to Deputy Stanton, if agreed today, the new Standing Order will come into effect almost immediately.  I expect we will be in a position to implement it as and from Tuesday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>We have not seen it yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That sounds extraordinary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the House be in a position to debate the Standing Order before it is adopted?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be a matter for discussion for the Whips.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the Deputies&rsquo; call.  Before the Standing Orders arising from this report are adopted, they should be presented to the House and debated.  They are worth debating.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot adopt something now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This must be discussed and decided by the Whips.  It is not a matter for me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Ceann Comhairle telling the House that adoption of this report will mean the automatic implementation of a Standing Order we have not yet seen?  Is it not true that Members should see and debate the Standing Order before adopting it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I must say as someone who has been a Member of the House for a long time that what is being suggested is singularly unhelpful.  It is the wish of every serving Deputy to try to improve the credibility of the parliamentary process.  Many of us have attended and made written and oral submissions to the Sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform.  The idea that we would assent without a full and proper debate to the suggestion that changing Standing Orders is a matter for the Whips to agree is unsatisfactory, as it affects every Member.  If no one else will call a vote on it, I will.  We should not pass this motion.  We should defer it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had enough people making decisions concerning us that we know nothing about, but the media blames us for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support the reservations expressed by a number of colleagues on this side of the House.  This is a matter I have brought to the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s attention many times.  We need to revert to the situation that used to prevail in the House.  Ministers used to answer questions, reply to Adjournment matters and appear in the House without taking the long absences that some current Ministers regularly do.  I will strongly object to any attempt to impose Standing Orders without adequate discussion in the House.</P>

	<P>The proposition before us states it relates to parliamentary standards.  One would have hoped for strengthening, improvement and enforcement of those standards.  I am only picking the discussion up in the exchange, but if what is being suggested has a direct impact on the conduct of business in the House, we cannot let it through on a nod.  If anything underscores the need for a full debate, surely it is the confusion that seems to reign in the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s contributions in response to Deputies this morning.  The full detail of the motion needs to be discussed in the Chamber and every Member must know what is being proposed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I am a great fan of Franz Kafka who wrote an extraordinary book entitled, <i>The Trial</i>.  In it, an individual was placed on trial, but no one would tell him what the charges were or what he needed to do in his defence.  The House is seemingly being asked to adopt a Standing Order that no one has seen and to impose it on ourselves early next week.  This is not the way any parliament should operate.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>The report arose from an incident in the House and the CPP was asked to determine how to deal with such matters in future.

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Today marks the first anniversary of the publication of the Ryan commission report into child abuse in which so many tragic incidents were uncovered.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, produced a list of 99 recommendations to be implemented in chronological order.  Some 12 of those should have been implemented by now, but they have not been.  When will the Bill on child care, which has passed through the Seanad, be debated in this House?</P>
        <P>In 2008, an all-party committee addressed the matter of soft information in respect of the vetting of personnel who deal with children and recommended unanimously to the Government that a relevant Bill should be introduced by December of that year.  We have not seen that Bill, so when is it likely to be produced, have its heads been discussed and will it appear before the House in the near future?</P>
        <P>Most importantly, the Government indicated that 270 social workers were to be recruited, but Deputy Shatter has informed me that few if any of them have been appointed.  The Taoiseach will announce more than 100 jobs today, but the Government has reneged on its commitment to recruit 270 social workers to work in an area of the greatest sensitivity.  When will the Government fulfil its commitment and recruit those 270 social workers to do their essential work?</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, never enters the House unless he is forced to do so by a vote.  Yesterday, his spokesman indicated that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny is straying from the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Thanks.  His spokesman stated there was no attempt by the Government to interfere in the traditional method of deer stalking.  I understand that there is some stalking going on in respect of the wildlife Bill by the unofficial wing of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party.  When will that Bill come before the House so we can see who is stalking whom?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Even an occasional guest appearance would be useful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for the Whips to arrange the legislation awaiting Second Stage.  Hopefully, that can be arranged very quickly.  Work is currently under way on drafting the heads of the national vetting bureau Bill, which is the legislation concerning soft information.  That ongoing work is being expedited by the Minister.  </P>
        <P>As regards the appointment of additional social workers, the HSE service plan for this year undertakes to recruit an additional 200 social workers for child protection services.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="759"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation plan promised 270.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Fifty by the end of the second quarter, a further 75 by the third quarter and the final 75 in the fourth quarter.  I understand from the HSE that the first candidates have been interviewed, and that by the end of June it expects to have recruited an additional 50 social workers.  As recently as the last week in April, the HSE placed further recruitment advertisements in national newspapers.  I am informed that the responses to these have been very positive.  The HSE will continue to interview and appoint social workers. </P>
        <P>The wildlife Bill will be taken later this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste have a fix on that?  She has not got the Bill in her sights yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>We will get the wildlife Bill quicker than the vetting Bill.  Clearly the Government is more concerned about animals than children, which is a very strange priority.</P>

	<P>I join with Deputy Kenny concerning the progress that has been made with the Murphy report on the anniversary of its publication.  I am glad to hear that some progress has been made in implementing some of the promises as outlined by the Minister in the implementation plan.  It would be appropriate for the Minister to provide the House with a progress report, rather than a short reply to a parliamentary question or a matter on the Order of Business.  That would be highly desirable, given the amount of time we gave to this important report when it was published.  Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate what is the situation concerning the promised updating of the contribution from the congregations arising from the paltry contribution that was agreed with the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods?  Arising from the Murphy report, a commitment was given that the contribution would be reviewed and updated.  </P>
        <P>I wish to raise another matter, which I think is in order.  On the first day after the Christmas recess, the House debated a Labour Party motion seeking to provide for a&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Give me a chance.  I do not bother the Ceann Comhairle on the Order of Business too often.  The motion sought an Oireachtas inquiry into the banking crisis, including the Government&rsquo;s record in that regard.  The motion was voted down by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Greens, who introduced an amendment to that motion.  That amendment required a number of things to be done.  There were to be two private inquiries.  One was to be conducted by the governor of the Central Bank and the other by two independent experts.  They were to report on 31 May this year, which is only ten days away now.  I would like to ask the Minister if&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This question is more appropriate for the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking for a debate on this matter now, if we have the reports.  Have the committees established by this House to inquire into the banks reported to the Minister yet?  If not, have they given any indication of when they will report?  Can the T&aacute;naiste give us a commitment that when the report is provided, it will be published immediately and debated in this House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two issues.  On the progress report, the Minister is more than happy to attend the House, so that can be arranged among the Whips.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="760"/>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>That is good. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On the second issue, the Government indicated that once the report had been made available, there will be a debate in this House, so there is no change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the reports be published when they are received?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has not yet received them, so that will have to be a matter for further consideration.</P>

	<P>As we know, this is the first anniversary of the publication of the Ryan report.  Yesterday evening, the Government passed an amendment congratulating its efforts on child protection, but when will we have an opportunity to evaluate the implementation of the recommendations in the Ryan, Murphy and Monageer reports, as well as the recent report published by the Ombudsman for Children?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have Question Time on the Order of Business. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Each and all of these need to be addressed on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  Will the Government accommodate an evaluation of progress on these recommendations in the coming week?  Will the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister of State with responsibility for children accommodate such an opportunity here on the floor of the D&aacute;il in the coming week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the same answer that I gave to the other Deputy.  If we can arrange a debate on the matter, the Minister is more than willing to attend the House.  We can arrange that.  </P>

	<P>I have two questions on legislation.  The Energy (Biofuel Obligations and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is nearing Report Stage.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, attempted to tag on a new section concerning the carbon windfall tax, which had nothing to do with bio-fuels.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm that we on this side of the House have been successful in ensuring that there will now be a new Bill on the carbon levy, separate from the Energy (Biofuel Obligations and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that is the intention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.  My second question concerns the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that he intended to make certain sporting events, including the Heineken Cup and the Six Nations tournament, free to air for Irish viewers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised on this matter?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="761"/>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I am seeking clarification on this.  The Greens are supporting the Minister, while Fianna F&aacute;il seems to be completely split on it.  The Minister stated in his press release, which is what I am dependent on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Media speculation is not promised legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>His specific words were that he would be bringing &ldquo;legislative change&rdquo;.  Is that the position?  There seem to be mixed messages coming from the Government.  It does not augur well in terms of public policy when there is such a split and confusion about a simple statement the Minister made. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can make inquiries to see if legislation is promised in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention to bring in legislation?  If so, why is it not on the legislative programme? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no proposed legislation.  The matter is out for consultation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>In his press release, the Minister used the term &ldquo;legislative change&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>There may be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not introduce this.  I am seeking clarification because the Minister has stated that he intends to bring in legislative change.  What does that mean at this stage?  No matter how one spins it, consultation is not legislative change.  What exactly does legislative change mean?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A parliamentary question to the Minister might help in the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  It is about legislation, so this is the place and this is the time.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but is it promised?  Media speculation on legislation is not promised legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>When a Minister makes an announcement, what is meant by legislative change?  Will the T&aacute;naiste please tell us exactly what it means?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no promised legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for consultation.  Arising from the consultation, decisions will be made as to whether legislative change is needed, or anything else for that matter.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>

	<P>No, this is in order.  They do not like by-elections or general elections and now do not even wish to hold the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta elections.  Consequently, I wish to ask two questions of the T&aacute;naiste, one of which pertains to the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Bill.  Will legislation be brought before this House to extend the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s and what is the position in respect of the nominees the Government has nominated to the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s board?  Have they been renominated, now that their term has expired or is legislation required in this regard?  When will the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s elections, which now are due, take place?  Will &Uacute;dar&aacute;s elections ever take place again?  Why, all of a sudden, does Fianna F&aacute;il dislike elections?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There is promised legislation in respect of the new &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Bill.  That has not been completed given the discussions arising from the strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister can postpone the elections under the existing legislation.  This is being considered in the context of the new legislation, which has not yet been brought to the House.</P>

	<P>The Ceann Comhairle has been very helpful to me in the past and often has advised me to table a parliamentary question.  I have followed his advice and have tabled repeatedly the same parliamentary question in respect of the same subject, only to receive the same answer.  The answer reads, &ldquo;If this matter remains of continuing concern to you, however, I would invite you to raise it with me again in due course&rdquo;.  This I am now doing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste, through the Ceann Comhairle, whether the health information Bill could be introduced, even secretly, into the House in order that Members could examine it and perhaps have a debate on it.

	<P>I will do more than give the Deputy a hint.  I gave the answer approximately five minutes ago, which is that the heads are being worked on as a matter of urgency by the Minister of State with responsibility for children.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>

        <P>I wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste about pending legislation but before doing so, I remind Members that we are in the latter end of May and 1 July beckons shortly.  That date&rsquo;s significance is that it is the date on which non-consultant hospital doctors change contracts.  Due to visa changes and the European working time directive, we have suffered a loss of non-consultant hospital doctors.  Our hospitals already are in chaos and Beaumont Hospital in particular has some of the longest waiting times and the highest number of people waiting on trolleys.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this leading towards a question on legislation?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I insist on finishing this.  The visas that were given to non-national non-consultant hospital doctors used to extend for two years, which allowed them to come to Ireland.  They constitute the backbone of the health service and the hospital system.  However, this period now has been reduced to six months and they are being charged &euro;800 every time they apply.  If ever there was a development designed to send these people out of this country, where they are badly needed, this is it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow me to inquire whether there is promised legislation in this area.</P>

	<P>Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle can be of assistance in respect of a new means of announcing legislation.  Yesterday evening, a spokesperson for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced to sections of the media that a new housing agency would be set up to deal with development land and loans that are taken out for developments in local authorities.  I refer to the aggregate development land Bill.  I knew nothing about this until then.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise two matters, because today marks the first anniversary of the publication of the Ryan commission report.  I intend to ask specifically about legislation in this regard but the 36th promise in the implementation plan published by the Government stated that the HSE and the youth justice service would develop a panel of appropriately skilled professionals to undertake investigations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, we will inquire about legislation for you.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>This was to be done by December 2009.  The panel referred to here comprises the 15 individuals out of whom three people must be selected to facilitate the inquiry that the Minister announced on the Adjournment debate on Tuesday evening would take place into the death of Daniel McAnaspie.  This panel should have been in place five months ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I ask the T&aacute;naiste whether legislation will be published to provide a statutory role to the persons appointed to that panel?  Second, if such legislation is to be published, when will Members have sight of it?  Third, if no legislation is to be published, why is the appointment of individuals to the aforementioned panel now five months behind time?  The failure to create the panel means that the independent inquiry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, please.  There is no provision to have a Second Stage-type contribution on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>No, but there is provision to ask about legislation arising directly from a Government promise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  So we will make inquiries about that legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The final point I wish to make that issue is that the HIQA report on the conducting of inquiries into the death of children in care recommends that within four weeks of a child in care dying, three people should be empanelled to commence the inquiry.  I <Col N="767"/>simply ask when will the 15 persons be put in place, out of whom three people may be selected?  Will they be selected by the Minister or by the HSE?</P>
        <P>In connection with the Ryan commission report, there was promised funding of &euro;2 million for counselling agencies.  It does appear that any legislation will be enacted with that.  The HSE was given &euro;1.8 million but money was promised to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and the One in Four organisation.  They have received no money and at least one of those organisations has a waiting list of nine months for individuals seeking counselling.  Can the T&aacute;naiste explain why neither of those two promises arising from the Ryan commission report has been implemented?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is inappropriate to contribute on these matters during the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no promised legislation on the disbursement of money to the voluntary sector or the statutory sector in the context of counselling services.  Arising from a debate we had a few minutes ago, the Minister of State indicated he was more than happy to come in here and review progress on the implementation of the recommendations as set down as a result of the debate that took place here last year, at which stage the Deputy will have more than enough time to put these questions to the Minister of State.  As the Deputy knows full well, this week the matter of the tragic death of that young man was discussed in the House.  The Minister of State indicated the panel would be set up as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The panel was supposed to be established by last December.  When will it be established?</P>

	<P>During the week, Commissioner Rehn indicated that Ireland may have to consider further cuts in this year&rsquo;s budget.

Will we have any more open scrutiny of the options coming before Government as a parliament?</P>

        <P>These amendments concern the removal of the provisions excluding local authority members from becoming members of the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Amendment No. 1 removes section 40(1)(<i>d</i>), which provides that a member of Inland Fisheries Ireland must relinquish such membership on becoming a member of a local authority.  I concurred with the arguments of Members of the other House and agreed that it was in order to remove this provision.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 2 is a consequential amendment that removes the clause in section 40(4) which disqualifies members of local authorities from becoming a member of Inland Fisheries Ireland.

	<P>The Government has not learned that past performance is a good indicator of future performance.  The Minister of State should check what has happened within the HSE, where the role of county councillors, while it was retained, was not kept at a local level.  A county councillor from Culdaff would have to travel to Galway to make representations for his constituency and was caught up in the whole debate on water pollution in Galway.  In this instance, the diabolical nature of the HSE model is being used as a bailiwick to avoid introducing county councillors to these boards.  It is important that there is local county council representation on this board.  It is an opportunity missed that should be re-examined.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the point of view here that mistakes were made in the composition of the HSE board in that county councillors from Culdaff discuss issues in Galway that are not relevant to their local needs.  I am encouraging the Minister of State &mdash; not attacking him &mdash; to ensure that lessons are learned from this HSE model in which county councillors from Donegal travel to Galway and <i>vice versa</i>.  They should be kept at local level.  I am not speaking about the composition of the board, but about where county councillors are located and what job they have to do, and not having county councillors from Waterford travelling to Donegal.  That is all I am doing.  I am offering assistance.  I am not disagreeing with or attacking the Minister of State.

I have made five appointments already and the Oireachtas committee will make the balance of those appointments.  There is absolutely no intention to have councillors travelling to any meetings of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  The Deputy&rsquo;s assertions seem to be based on either ignorance or misunderstanding of what is in the Bill.  The Bill is about Inland Fisheries Ireland.

	<P>There is a requirement that people read the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State please sit down and allow me to speak?  It does not do his office any service.  There is a certain misunderstanding in the debate.</P>
        <P>I welcome the two amendments that have been tabled because this is an area about which I have always been uneasy.  I agree with the Minister of State&rsquo;s leader, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, when he defends the right of public representatives to be appointed to boards in certain situations when they have expertise.  Being a public representative is honourable and it should not automatically exclude one from being appointed to a board where one is a suitable contender.</P>
        <P>I appreciate there is much frustration about the HSE and this has spilled over today.  I certainly share that frustration.  However, in this instance we should remember that the Minister of State has introduced legislation which has the support of the sector.  It results from a major report examining how to ensure the future management of our fisheries.  Generally speaking, we all support the approach.  On the specifics of whether somebody happens to be on a local authority, the Minister of State has taken on board the approach taken by Fine Gael in the Seanad.  I certainly welcome that.</P>
        <P>Since the Minister of State has mentioned the appointments he has made, he must be aware &mdash; I would like to ensure that he is fully aware &mdash; that there are concerns about those appointments.  Obviously, the joint Oireachtas committee will have an opportunity to make up for the imbalance that has arisen.  However, I have concerns as it has already happened with regard to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  It is really not the job of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to ensure there is balance.  Our job is to find the very best people but very often we end up not necessarily with the best but with those who fit the categories ignored by the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>The chairperson of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and others have made the point that the board members were unhappy with the lack of representation from the coarse, commercial, drift, draft, snap and sea-angling sectors, and the lack of regional balance with no representation from the east, south east and south west of the country.  This is obviously a gap and an imbalance that we will have to address and I urge the Minister of State to take this into account.  Ultimately, it is not us who make the appointments, it is the Minister of State.  It is a pity that a new board with a new life and a new approach has already been subject to a certain amount of controversy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will certainly take that on board.  I emphasise it is a nine member board so inevitably the emphasis must be on expertise and people who are suitably qualified to deliver the change and reform required in the inland fisheries sector.  It will not be a case of, in the proverbial words of Gay Byrne, &ldquo;one for everyone in the audience&rdquo;.  I cannot assure the Deputy with regard to all of these interest groups which have written to her seeking to be represented on the board in some fashion.  It will not be possible and we must be honest about that.  However, there will be an opportunity in the forum that will exist following the passing of the Bill for all of those sectoral and geographical factors to be heard.  It will be the primary listening post for the new authority and the new executive to consult with the sector at large.</P>
        <P>To the Deputy from Donegal, it is important to state that this is a significant opportunity to reform and change the sector.  It has been in the pipeline for ten years and seven previous Ministers and Ministers of State have gestated over it.  I thank Deputy McManus for the assistance she gave on Committee Stage.  I know the Deputy opposite is concerned about what <Col N="774"/>happened in the HSE as, I think, is everybody in the House.  He will appreciate that the amendment is aimed to redress a wrong done to councillors, which is now followed almost by ritual as many Bills contain this prohibition as if councillors were in some way suspect individuals without qualification or merit to be part of these bodies.  I hope other Ministers and Ministers of State will follow suit and do the same.  I agree with him that there needs to be more consultation by the HSE with local representatives at a local level.  He is quite correct to state the era we have gone through in which people clocked in for conferences in parts of the country far from their own area is gone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  I threw out the past experience as a good indicator of future performance and I appreciate him taking on board that there are lessons to be learned.  Certainly, there are people with the skills required on local authorities and they could be on the board.  I appreciate what the Minister of State has said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to record my personal thanks, and I am sure the House would also like to pay tribute to all of the people who participated over the years, particularly the outgoing members of the regional fisheries boards for the service they have given to the inland water resource.  It is not often said and it would not be right to finish our conclusions here without recording very strongly our gratitude and thanks for the work it does and hope that even though the new structures mean that it will not be board members, it will contribute its voluntary efforts in the future for the protection of this very valuable resource.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I support that view and thank all those who have given great service and  provided expertise, wisdom and local knowledge, very often at considerable costs in terms of time, over the years.  An extraordinary contribution has been made, largely on a voluntary basis, some of which has been very useful in making decisions on planning, spatial planning decisions and all the rest.  We have to move on.  I wish the structures well.  This morning we have moved into calmer waters and I hope that will also be the case for the new structures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur.  Members of the angling fraternity feel they probably need stronger representation.  With the disbanding of the Salmon Commission as part of this Bill, a serious debate is needed on the conservation of salmon stock.  The debate has been of a one-way nature and has put the whole and collective blame on drift net and draft net fishermen.  It has now been proven, even in the absence of drift and draft net fishermen.  We need to have a serious debate as to why salmon stocks are not returning and why the larger populations of seals which are being reported are not being investigated.  We need to examine what type of damage has been done to salmon stocks by seals.  We need the Marine Institute to work closely with that.  </P>
        <P>We also need to take cognisance of something which I raised at the initial Stages of this Bill.  The locks agency is becoming a bureaucratic monster.  Every regulation it introduces has to go through London, Stormont and Dublin.  It is becoming a very difficult piece of work, in terms of getting commonsense practice at a local level.  We need to keep and eye on these things.  More challenges will come down the track.</P>
        <P>In Foyle, as the Minister of State is well aware, there are 18 drift net licences and 19 draft net licences.  The fishermen concerned decided not to take a voluntary buy-out and decided, because of historic and traditional interests, to keep these licences.  They are not destroying the salmon stocks compared to other possible reasons, such as pollution or the seal population.  We need a debate on what we can do to try to protect them.  We have completely banned drift and draft net fishing from our island.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome such a debate if Deputy McHugh decides to initiate it.  It would be timely.  On the locks agency, I am not sure whether it is a bureaucratic monster yet.  I will meet with him on that because I am anxious to hear if an agency is becoming overly bureaucratic.  I would like to hear his comments.</P>

	<P>These are technical amendments designed to ensure that the indexing provisions will apply to any enactments enacted on or after the commencement date that amend other enactments.  For example, a new Act may substitute a provision to an existing Act that amends a penalty provision which can be imposed on summary conviction and these amendments will ensure that a fine will fall into one of the classes referred to in sections 4 to 8, <Col N="776"/>inclusive, that is, class A, B, C, D or E.  These amendments mean there will be no ambiguity as to the penalties comprehended by the indexing provisions.</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;13.&mdash;(1) A notification under <i>subsection (2) </i>of <i>section 15 </i>shall be addressed to the person concerned by name, and may be so served on or given to the person in one of the following ways:</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a standard provision found in legislation where provision is made for a notification or other document to be served on or given to a person.  A recent example of such a provision is in section 9 of the Charities Act 2009.  This provision is being applied to the notification required under section 15(2) of the Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  </P>
        <P>Section 15(2) provides that a recovery order shall not enter into force unless the person in respect of whom the order is made fails to pay a fine by the due date of payment.  It further provides that where the person so fails the order shall have effect from the day immediately following the day on which the Courts Service notifies the receiver concerned in writing that person failed to pay the fine by that date.  This is a critical notification as it will activate the recovery order and trigger action by the receiver when he or she is notified that a person on whom a fine has been imposed is in default.  For that reason, it is important that arrangements for the service of this particular notification are clearly defined in the primary legislation.

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have any objection to this amendment but wish to make two points on it.  It appears to be a fairly standard provision referring to the service documents.  If it is so standard, why was it omitted in the first instance?</P>
        <P>There is a bigger issue here in regard to the service of documents, in particular the time honoured service of documents by registered post.  We have experienced a greater level of social and economic mobility and a change to workforce patterns to the extent that a person&rsquo;s principal private dwelling, to which the service of documents is generally rendered, is usually unoccupied giving rise to a real issue about the service of documents, in particular registered post.</P>
        <P>All Members will be aware that the system operated by An Post is such that if nobody is home, a slip is placed through the letter-box requesting the person to whom the notice is addressed to call to the local post office, or sorting office in the case of larger towns.  That is not often done and letters may be lying around for days.  Letters are returned to sender in numbers which are unprecedented.  That was not the case in the past, so it is an issue.</P>
        <P>I wonder about an alternative mode or substituted service becoming more the norm than the exception.  Currently, substituted service can only be done after an application to the District Court.  It is cumbersome, can take some time and it is not very straightforward.  I wonder about the possibility of change in this area, notwithstanding what the Minister will say about the important nature of the service reflecting the important nature of the document.</P>
        <P>The Minister said the rules committee is actively engaged in this.  Will he ask it to look at the service of documents?  The registered post is not as it was 40 years ago, or even ten years ago, and I believe it is unsatisfactory.  I am conscious that the service of a document is not of the same import as the service of a birthday card or a letter.  There is an issue here and I ask the Minister to ask the rules committee to look at it.  Indeed, the Minister may have a view on it.</P>

	<P>If somebody changes address, can he or she plead a certain degree of ignorance or that he or she did not receive the document?  Should there be a provision whereby the onus is placed on the person to notify change of address?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Charles Flanagan raised a point about the service of documents in regard to court proceedings.  There is no doubt there has been greater flexibility in recent times.  However, it is best left to the rules of the various courts to decide how effective service is guaranteed.  It cannot be guaranteed in all cases but prosecutions cannot proceed unless there is proof that documents were validly served on those involved.  In recent times, there have been a number of incidences where people have gone into court and sworn they did not receive the documents and, therefore, the prosecution failed.  Changes have been made to try to facilitate that.</P>
        <P>In subsequent legislation, we will look at how that situation can be dealt with in such a way that somebody cannot evade prosecution simply by saying he or she did not receive something.  In this instance, this is a standard provision and it is necessary because of the way in which this Act will be commenced.  It is necessary to write this into the primary legislation because it will start from the time the legislation is commenced.  Thereafter, it will be up to us to give the maximum flexibility to the committee which deals with the rules of court for the particular court.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment arises from an issue raised on Committee Stage.  While I was unable to agree to the specific amendments put forward by the Labour Party on Report Stage in the Seanad, which would not have allowed the court to impose a fine greater than the otherwise appropriate fine after the court had taken into account the financial circumstances of the person, an official amendment comprising a new formulation for subsection (3) was made by me in the Seanad.  The amendment does not alter the substance of the section but it is clear in making the linkage between subsections (1) and (3).</P>
        <P>The amendment does not alter the substance of the section but it is clear in making the link between subsections (1) and (3).  Adjustments either up or down in the level of the fine can only be made for the purpose of the section as set out in subsection (1), which ensures that the effect of a fine on a person or his or her dependents is not significantly abated or made more severe by reason of his or her financial circumstances.  Our legal advice is that even without the express reference to the purpose in subsection (3), the court would be acting contrary to the section if it increased or decreased a fine for a purpose other than that set out in section (1).</P>
        <P>In taking account of financial circumstances in determining the amount of the fine, the court is given wide scope so as to arrive at a fair assessment of the person&rsquo;s means.  The term &ldquo;financial circumstances&rdquo; is defined in section 12 and comprises income, assets, liabilities, moneys owing and such other circumstances as the court considers appropriate.</P>

	<P>A court, when directing that a fine be paid by instalments, will specify the time during which they are required to be paid.  This can be 12 months or a shorter period from the time that they would otherwise have fallen due.  This is called the &ldquo;due date for payment.&rdquo;  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, in accordance with normal practice, the period during which the fine must be paid by instalments commences the day after it would otherwise have had to be paid instead of the day itself.

	<P>Section 14, as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, provides for the payment of fines by instalments.  Subsection (1) permits an offender to make an application to the court which imposed the fine to use that method of payment.  Subsection (7) obliges the court to inform the offender of his or her right to make such an application.  It is the intention that the application can be made subsequent to the court hearing which imposed the fine.  For example, a person might not have applied to pay by instalments when the fine was imposed but subsequently incurred a major expense that makes it difficult to pay a lump sum.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not place a time limit on the making of such an application, although common sense would suggest that an application after the due date for payment would not be entertained.  To prevent uncertainty, Seanad amendment No. 27 states that an application to pay by instalments must be made before the receiver is notified of the default.  This is likely to be several weeks after the default because breathing space will be given to persons following a series of reminders.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 25 is consequential to providing that an application can be made at any time up to notifying the receiver of the default.  This is because a person can make a further application for an extension of up to one year after the original application.  It is necessary that the two applications are not confused.  The first involves paying by instalments and the second is for an extension to the original period of payment directed by the court.  These amendments clarify the time available for making an application to pay a fine by instalments where such an application was not made on the date of the court hearing at which the fine was first imposed.</P>

	<P>These are drafting amendments.  The Parliamentary Counsel has decided that section 14(6), while correct, does not fit comfortably into section 14.  The purpose of the subsection is to establish the appropriate period of imprisonment when a fine has been partially paid by instalments.  This is already achieved in the inserted section 2A to section 17(3) of the Courts (No. 2) Act 1986 in regard to defaults on fines imposed on indictment.</P>
        <P>A similar provision relating to fines imposed on summary conviction has now been included in the intersected subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) of the amended section 2 of the 1986 Act.  This is a more obvious place for these amendments because the relevant provisions in section 17 already deal with appropriate periods of imprisonment, where the receiver can only recover part of the crime or the proceeds from seized goods might only satisfy part of the fine.</P>
        <P>The same definition of &ldquo;fine&rdquo; is being added to section 2A of the Courts (No. 2) Act 1986 to ensure that it does not include the fees and expenses of the receiver.  These are relevant solely to section 15.</P>

        <P>One of the effects of the several amendments that were made to section 14 in the D&aacute;il was that the expression &ldquo;new date for payment&rdquo; was rendered unnecessary but that definition remained due to an oversight.  The Parliamentary Counsel is satisfied that the only definition now necessary in section 14 is the original definition of &ldquo;due date for payment&rdquo;.  There is no need to copy the definition because it appears in other sections and the only difference is a cross-reference to section 14.</P>

	<P>Where a receiver is notified by the Courts Service that a person has not paid a fine by the due date, the recovery order made by the court which imposed the fine takes effect.  That gives the receiver power to recover the fine or seize and sell property belonging to the offender equal to the amount of the fine.  It may be the case that part of the fine was paid by instalments.</P>
        <P>One of the purposes of this amendment is to give the receiver power in such circumstances to recover either the part of the fine that remains unpaid or to seize and sell property equal to its value.  While the implication may be that the receiver can only recover money or property to the value of the unpaid part of the fine, it is desirable to make that clear in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The other purpose of the amendment is to permit the receiver to recover the fees and expenses reasonably incurred in the performance of his or her functions.  The appropriate fees will be set out in a fees order and a record of the expenses will have to be maintained and supplied to the Courts Service every six months.  Any overcharging for expenses can have implications for the contract between the Courts Service and the receiver as well as a possible criminal offence under the legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On Report Stage I introduced a list of amendments which set out how the provisions relating to the receiver would operate in practice and how receivers would be appointed.  The purpose of these amendments is to put on a statutory basis the necessary measures to ensure that the fees and expenses which receivers can claim are open, transparent and reasonable.  </P>
        <P>Seanad amendment No.32 removes the requirements relating to vouching of expenses.  Instead of placing the time consuming burden of vouching every expense on the Courts Service, I am putting the onus on receivers to maintain a record of their expenses and fees which will be forwarded to the Courts Service at regular intervals.</P>
        <P>In regard to Seanad amendment No. 33, section 15(4) obliges a receiver to perform his or her functions subject to directions or conditions specified in the recovery order, including any directions or conditions in respect of the receiver paying amounts received by him or her into the court.  This amendment allows the receiver to apply to the court for directions relating to the performance of his or her functions.  Receivers will have to contend with a variety of circumstances while performing their functions, ranging from recovering small to very large amounts, and it is wise to give them power to apply to the court for directions in specific cases.</P>
        <P>Seanad amendment No. 34 sets out what will happen if the receiver recovers and sells property of greater value than the amount of the fine or the unpaid part thereof.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It repeats the provisions under which the receiver will be obliged to return to the offender as much of the proceeds of the sale as exceeds the fine or the unpaid part of it.  For the purposes of this provision, the normal definition of fine is amended to include the fees of the receiver and the expenses reasonably incurred by him or her.  This is because when a fine is imposed, it will not at that stage be known what the exact amount of the receiver&rsquo;s expenses will be and they will thus not form part of the fine.  This also entails the deletion of the current definition of fine in amendment No. 38 for the purpose of this section.  The definition of fine in section 12 will apply to the section.</P>
        <P>Seanad amendment No. 35 deals with the making of a fees order by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  I envisage that the fees order made under this provision will operate in a similar manner to the fees orders for Revenue sheriffs, the work the receivers will perform being essentially the same as that of the sheriffs.</P>
        <P>Seanad amendment No. 37 obliges the receiver to make and maintain a written record of the fees deducted and the expenses incurred and deducted from the sum recovered or the proceeds of any sale of property pursuant to a recovery order.  At least every six months the receiver will give the Courts Service a written record of fees and expenses, and the making of any false or misleading entry in the record will be a criminal offence.  I decided to create this offence, with severe penalties, because where false and misleading information is given there is potential for considerable amounts of money to be involved.  In addition, I envisage that the contract between the receiver and the Courts Service will be drawn up in such a way that in such circumstances, the contract will immediately be terminated.</P><Col N="785"/>
        <P>Seanad amendments Nos. 36 and 39 are largely drafting amendments.  Amendment No. 36 deletes section 15(8), while amendment No. 39 inserts a new section providing for the addition of the receiver&rsquo;s fees to the moneys that can be subtracted from the moneys to be paid into the Exchequer as a result of the appointment of the receiver.  These amendments complete the scheme proposed for the operation of the receiver provisions.  In the course of the debates on the legislation, and particularly on Report Stage, the role of the receiver was revised and brought more centrally into how the default provisions will work.  The revised role of the receiver made it important that the fees and expenses provisions be fully thought through and included in the Bill rather than left for administrative action or rules of court.  That will facilitate the smoother operation of the receiver provisions as well as obliging receivers to maintain proper records of their expenses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support these amendments because I accept the principle of the Minister&rsquo;s objectives in terms of the appointment, operation and day-to-day engagement of the receiver.  However, I am anxious that the message should go from this House that whatever expenses are incurred by way of professional fees, travel expenses and so on must be kept to a minimum.  We are dealing with people who, for one reason or other, are unable to pay a fine.  If they were in a position to pay the fine and to do so promptly there would be no need for a receiver.</P>
        <P>The Minister draws a parallel between the receiver and the Revenue sheriff or bailiff.  However, there are often difficulties in terms of the costs added on to instalments that are due, having regard to the fact that these are almost exclusively people in financial difficulty.  I am aware of cases where Revenue sheriffs are setting up standing engagements to visit debtors perhaps twice a week in order to extract payments.  I am not saying these payments are not lawfully due; rather that on occasion, due regard may not be given to the person&rsquo;s ability or inability to pay.  If a receiver decides to travel, on notice, 50 or 60 miles to visit a fine defaulter on a Monday &mdash; being a regional receiver as I am sure will be the case &mdash; and return on the Wednesday or Friday, we will have a situation where the expenses of the receiver may well exceed the amount of the fine and could run to hundreds if not thousands of euro.  My understanding is that the receiver will have first call in so far as his or her expenses will be discharged out of whatever sale of goods or chattels takes place.</P>
        <P>I do not have an immediate solution to this problem but I am anxious that the Minister make a clear statement in the House that this system will not be a money-making exercise for receivers and that costs and expenses will be held within specific limits.  There are already concerns at the ease with which a Revenue sheriff can clock up considerable expenses which take precedence over the sum sought in the first instance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a cause for concern that there may be industrious and imaginative people who see this provision as a potential mine for economic gain.  Deputy Charles Flanagan has summed up the issue well.  We must prevent situations where the cost of recovery of the fine exceeds the fine itself.  It would be dangerous to allow that type of culture to emerge.  Seanad amendment No. 35 is quite vague in this regard, indicating that the Minister may specify the &ldquo;rates at which fees that may be so deducted shall be calculated&rdquo;.  There must be clarity in order to prevent the system being undermined in any way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with a new procedure.  The purpose of this Bill is twofold.  The first is the indexation of fines in order to bring all existing fines up to today&rsquo;s values.  The second is to ensure the payment of fines and to obviate the need for people to be imprisoned because of a failure to pay relatively small amounts of money.  There have been instances over the years where people were hauled off to prison only to be released within <Col N="786"/>hours after paying the money due, both fine and costs, as ordered by the court.  Others are released after a period of confinement in order to free up spaces.  As I said in recent days, because of the changes in legislation we have implemented both on the civil side and the criminal side, people will no longer be imprisoned for the non-payment of civil debt or criminal fines unless they have the means and are purposely refusing to pay.</P>
        <P>Under the current system, if a person is fined &euro;500 in the District Court for a motor traffic offence, for example, he or she is liable to seven days in prison in case of default.  In other words, if the money is not paid within a week, that person will eventually get a knock on the door from a garda to be told that he or she will be going to Mountjoy if the money is not paid.  In future, however, what will happen is that the court will impose a fine and will nominate a receiver who will, if the person does not pay within the due date and where an application has not been made and granted for payment by instalments, approach the person and take property in lieu of the fine.</P>
        <P>Obviously, there are costs involved.  The issue is addressed in the primary rather than secondary legislation because during discussion of the Bill in both Houses, Members indicated this approach would be preferable.</P>
        <P>To continue with the sequencing, if the receiver returns to find there are no goods available to take in lieu of the fine, a community service order may be made, whereby the person can repay his or her debt to the community by doing a number of hours of community service.  If this sanction is not applied or the person cannot participate in community service, the final option is prison.</P>
        <P>The concept of equality of impact is built into the legislation.  In other words, there is a statutory onus on members of the Judiciary, in imposing a fine on a person within the limits laid down for the offence in question, to take into account the financial circumstances of the person on whom the fine is imposed.  The first check and balance is that the fine is not unduly unfair to the person given his or her financial circumstances.</P>
        <P>The next stage is the receiver.  It is reasonable that the receiver should obtain the costs and expenses incurred in seeking to secure property in lieu of a fine.  In the intervening period, the person can make an application to pay by instalments and provided the instalments are paid, there is no question that a receiver will be dispatched.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The objective is to ensure the costs of the receiver mirror the costs of the sheriff.  The costs are set down in the fees orders and are reasonable in the circumstances.  The Department must liaise with the Courts Service in this respect.  The manner in which returns are made is laid down in the primary legislation.  It is a criminal offence if the person who secures the contract deviates from it or takes more than is required.  In such circumstances, the contract would also be terminated.  I assure Deputies the fees will be as reasonable as possible in the circumstances and will be aligned to the current fees orders that are made in respect of sheriffs when they do their business.</P>

	<P>The purpose of amendment No. 40 is to ensure the definition of &ldquo;fine&rdquo; is properly inserted in the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983 and that the reference to the Fines Act 2010 is correct.  Under the 1983 Act, community service can only be imposed by a court as an alternative to imprisonment.  In this legislation I am extending the possibility of community service being imposed to circumstances in which a fine has not been paid by the due date and a receiver has been unable to recover the fine or its value in property.  Therefore, by inserting in the 1983 Act provisions where the word &ldquo;fine&rdquo; is used, it is necessary to define &ldquo;fine&rdquo; for the purposes of that Act.  The definition being inserted is the standard definition of &ldquo;fine&rdquo; as used in the Courts (No. 2) Act 1986 which it is proposed to amend by way of amendment No. 43 to section 17.</P><Col N="789"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Section 2 of the Courts (No. 2) Act 1986 deals with the consequences of not paying a fine by the due date for payment.  It applies only to fines imposed in the District Court.  Amendments Nos. 41 and 43 give the proper reference in the Courts (No. 2) Act 1986 to the Fines Act 2010 and provide for a new definition of &ldquo;fine&rdquo; in subsection (2) of the 1986 Act that excludes the fees and expenses of the receiver.  This is necessary because the 1986 definition includes a reference to expenses, which could be confused with the receiver&rsquo;s expenses.  The receiver&rsquo;s fees and expenses are dealt with separately in section 15.</P>

	<P>Section 19 provides a name and shame provision for persons who fail to pay their fines by the due date of payment.  It is an additional measure which will encourage most persons to pay their fines.  The Courts Service will be responsible for publishing the list of fine defaulters and the service will decide on the most appropriate means of so publishing.  If it chooses the Internet, there will be a permanent record of the default.</P>
        <P>The purpose of amendment No. 45 is to ensure that if the person pays the fine after the due date of payment but before his or her name and address are published, the name and address will not be published.  In the case of publication on the Internet, amendment No. 46 will oblige the Courts Service to erase the reference to the default in any particular case after eight weeks or if and when the fine has been paid, whichever is the sooner.  For example, as soon as the offender has failed to pay by the due date, his or her name could be published as a fine defaulter.  However, a period of approximately eight weeks will elapse before the receiver is sent notification of the default by the Courts Service.  During that period, more efforts will be made to have the fine paid through a series of reminders.  If the offender pays within the eight week period, his or her name will at that point be removed from the list and if he or she still does not pay, the name and address will be removed in any case after eight weeks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to say a few words about the Bill.  I welcome its passing and the assistance we got from the Opposition in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  I said in the Seanad that if there was a case for its retention, then I would have to point out that considerable amendments were made, and a good teasing out of the Bill occurred in that House.  It made life that little bit easier for us in the D&aacute;il when we brought forward the Bill in its final format.  It has changed considerably since it was originally drafted.  Many efforts were made before, and a Member pointed out on the Order of Business recently that we have been waiting for this Bill for some time.  It is a very dramatic reform of the way in which fines are levied, paid and followed up by the courts and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The core of the Bill is about ensuring that someone will end up in prison for non-payment of criminal fines only as a last resort.  This view that there are thousands of people languishing in prisons because they have not paid fines is wrong.  Only about 1% of the prison population at any given time is in prison for non-payment of fines, but even that is too much.  In my own experience as a solicitor and as a public representative, there are people who are hauled off to prison by the Garda.  When the Opposition validly raises the question of the number of bench warrants that are not executed, a reaction happens whereby the Garda follow up on those bench warrants.  I am not blaming Deputy Flanagan for the fact that garda&iacute; knock on doors all over the country and haul people off to prison, but when the issue of the number of bench warrants is raised here in the Chamber, people feel that there are criminals running around the country who should be in jail.  The vast majority of the thousands of bench warrants that are not executed at any given time are for the non-payment of fines.  I can recall that when the issue was raised in the D&aacute;il, the Garda subsequently launched a significant campaign around the country to reduce the number of bench warrants, which ultimately meant that people were hauled into prison for the non-payment of dog licences, television licences and so on.  These were outstanding bench warrants and they had to be executed.</P>
        <P>Since we passed legislation on civil debt, nobody has gone to jail for non-payment of such debts.  When we pass this Bill, very few people will go to prison for non-payment of fines.  If they do go to prison, it is because they had the resources and they resolutely refused to pay.  We have done a good day&rsquo;s work in this area today, but also in the context of the indexation of these fines.  The equality of impact principle is also built into the Bill, whereby the courts have to take into account the means of a person before them before they levy a fine.</P>
        <P>I thank the Opposition spokespersons for their input.  I thank the staff of the Oireachtas as well as my own staff for the work they have done in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to acknowledge what the Minister has done.  It is a very important Bill and I acknowledge the manner in which he has put the Bill through the House.  I am sure it will be signed by the President soon.</P><Col N="792"/>
        <P>There is a real need for this Bill.  The Minister somewhat downplayed the figures when he said that a mere 1% of prisoners at any one time are in jail for defaulting on fines.  That can be 400 people, which represents a lot of our citizens at any one time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be 10%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>That would make it 40 people at any one time.  The reality is that 3,500 people were imprisoned last year for the non-payment of fines.  That is a lot of people.  I know that fewer than 200 of those were imprisoned for non-payment of civil debt, but it is quite preposterous that so many people should be in jail for non-violent offences.  It has given rise to a serious overcrowding problem in our prisons.</P>
        <P>This Bill is welcome and it is important we recognise that there are more practical solutions.  I regret that the attachment of earnings order has not been extended.  I feel that is an area that we must revisit.  It is absolutely essential that greater use is made of community service orders and that we develop further the concept of restorative justice in practice.  The pilot areas and the studies will show that this is an effective means of dealing with societal problems without putting people behind bars.</P>
        <P>This Bill is important at a time when people are struggling to make ends meet and when families are suffering from the ravages of unemployment and the economic downturn.  If the State imposes fines lawfully, it is welcome that there are arrangements in place other than taking a person&rsquo;s liberty away.</P>
        <P>I wish the Bill well and I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s initiative in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, we must acknowledge a decent Bill when it comes before us.  We in the Labour Party sought to ensure that the Minister would take into account a person&rsquo;s earnings and means when making a decision on imprisonment.  I am glad that has happened.</P>
        <P>I take the Minister&rsquo;s point about the small percentage of those who are in prison as a result of non-payment of fines.  However, this Bill is only one part of a jigsaw that needs to be examined, because the overall prison service must also be examined.  The recent departure of Kathleen McMahon and John Lonergan is significant and we must take cognisance of what Ms McMahon was saying in respect of the governance procedures that dictate how the prison system is run.</P>
        <P>There is an issue of overcrowding and there are scenarios where we have three or four people in a cell.  The former governor of Mountjoy Prison has spoken extensively about the humane treatment of prisoners.  The idea of a prisoner slopping out in this day and age is ludicrous.  If we take the Fines Bill as one part of the jigsaw, then there is no doubt that we will have fewer people in prison as a result of this legislation, which is welcome.  However, common sense must speak to the issue of overcrowding in prisons and the governance procedures for the prison service.  We need to ask whether somebody like Ms Kathleen McMahon could have stayed within the system if she had been allowed a greater deal of autonomy to allow her to progress the agenda upon which she had embarked.  There is also the issue of the D&oacute;chas centre.  There is overcrowding and there seems to be a shortage of prison places.  The Minister recently stated in this House that Kilworth prison is still on the agenda.  In real terms there is no sign of that prison and the creation of extra places.  A wider debate needs to take place on this issue.  We support the Bill, which we hope will reduce the number of people in prison.  We hope a qualitative and quantitative approach taken to how the prison system is run.</P>

    <Title>Nurses and Midwives Bill 2010: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill which has been awaited for a very long time.  It has been almost a permanent fixture on the list of promised legislation for years.  It is ironic that the Bill appears now as the professions of nursing and midwifery in this State go through their worst experience since the 1980s due to the savage cutbacks being imposed on our health services by the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government.</P>
        <P>New legislation to replace the Nurses Act 1985 was recommended by the Commission on Nursing in 1998.  The Government health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, in 2001 promised that &ldquo;provisions for the statutory registration of health professionals will be strengthened and expanded&rdquo;.  It set a target date of 2003 for new legislation on nurses.  Why it has taken seven years longer than the target date to produce this legislation?  That has never been explained despite the repeated efforts of Deputies on the Opposition benches to extract information on the progress in the preparation of the Bill.  What does it say about Government health policy and the condition of the Department of Health and Children?  The symptoms are clearly alarming and the diagnosis is not good.</P>
        <P>The same health strategy set a target date of 2002 for new legislation to provide for clear statutory provisions on entitlement to health services.  After eight years all we have got is the name of a Bill &mdash; the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill &mdash; on the list of promised legislation.  The Government is still telling us that heads of the Bill have yet to be approved and it is not possible to indicate when it will be published.  It is not hard to see the reason for the suppression of this commitment in the health strategy.  The last thing the Government wants to do is to debate &mdash; let alone set out in legislation &mdash; the people&rsquo;s entitlements to health services and personal social services.  To do so would undermine the basis of the wholly inequitable two-tier public-private system over which successive governments have presided, none more so than the current series of governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il since 1997.  It would also expose the gross unfairness of the health cuts currently being imposed by this Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Administration.</P>
        <P>The Nurses and Midwives Bill comes before us in the context of those cuts.  In the week the Second Stage of the Bill commenced in the D&aacute;il we had the announcement of the cutting of 52 beds in Beaumont Hospital and the axing of virtually all dental services for medical card patients.  This is to be followed shortly by another Bill to undermine the medical card system, the prescription charges Bill, imposing charges for medicines on medical cardholders.  The people on the front line who have to cope with the outcome of the cuts in terms of patient care are the nurses and midwives who form the core of the legislation before us.  I pay tribute to them for the superb work they do in caring for people in our health services.  Each of us has had our respective experiences as have our families.  Thanks are due from all of us.  They carry out that work despite being hampered by a fundamentally flawed system, by mismanagement at Government and HSE level, and by the current cuts.</P>
        <P>Nurses and midwives constitute a large section of the public service workers who have been so vilified in recent times.  The crass catch-cry that we have heard time after time is &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they lucky to have jobs?&rdquo;  The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It is not that they are lucky that they are in jobs; it is we, the people, who are lucky that every nurse is employed in the public health service because we rely on them for our hospital and community care.  If they were not there, we would all know about it.  In fact there are not enough of them.  The Government moratorium on staffing in the public health service has seen the non-replacement of more than 1,900 nursing and midwifery posts.  If the Government gets its way, the recruitment ban will continue and a further 6,000 posts in the public health services will be lost in the next three years and, as I <Col N="794"/>indicated to the Taoiseach in recent days, another 3,500 acute hospital beds will be lost.  That is a very serious vista.</P>
        <P>I commend the more than 40,000 members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation who have campaigned not only against the unjust pay cuts imposed on them, but very importantly against the many cuts in services to patients over recent years.  It is most often the nurses who have blown the whistle on the Health Service Executive and the Government, exposing malpractice, the reality of accident and emergency unit overcrowding, and the myriad other effects of Government cutbacks.  Without their courage many of the tragic experiences we have addressed in this Chamber and that have been exposed for full public scrutiny would never have seen the light of day.</P>
        <P>In view of this it is no surprise that the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation is recommending rejection of the Croke Park deal.  Last winter the INMO and the other health unions went the extra mile in the pre-budget talks with the Government.  They were and are prepared to help implement far-reaching changes in working practices to enhance the public health services.  However, that deal was rejected by Government when it staged its mock backbench revolt.  It baffles me why, in those circumstances, the leaders of the public service unions returned to the talks and accepted such a fundamentally flawed deal as that now before the membership for balloting.</P>
        <P>This is the very serious backdrop against which we debate this Bill.  However, it is more than a backdrop.  Such is the attack on our public health services that the professions of nursing and midwifery are being undermined.  With its anti-public service agenda and its drive to privatisation this Government has damaged nursing as a profession, as a calling to provide care on the basis of need and as a service to all of us, the people.  We should take the opportunity of this Bill to reassert the role of nursing as a public service.  I commend the stated purpose of the Bill to enhance the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and to ensure the integrity of the practice of nursing and midwifery.  It aims to provide for a modern, efficient, transparent and accountable system for the regulation of nursing  and midwifery, ensuring that all nurses and midwives are appropriately qualified and competent to practise in a safe manner and on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provisions for the establishment of Bord Altranais agus Cn&aacute;imhseachais na h&Eacute;ireann, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  The composition of the new board as set out in the Bill seems representative and I welcome some of the more open procedures for the appointment of members, including the election of eight nurses or midwives by nurses and midwives themselves.</P>
        <P>The enhanced recognition of midwifery is welcome.  However, concerns have been raised already that the representation of midwifery on the new board is not sufficient and about the legal requirement for indemnity for midwives.  I ask the Minister to note this.  There is concern that the Bill may not go far enough in recognising midwifery as a distinct profession.  I recognise it and affirm that in the House.  The requirements for proper qualification, registration, complaints procedures and sanctions where necessary are appropriate.  These are detailed sections and will require careful scrutiny on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Section 86 outlines the duties of the Health Service Executive to facilitate education and training of student nurses and midwives and the Bill will provide the legal basis for this.  The big question is whether the HSE will be able to fulfil this mandate in the context of major cuts to public health services.  Nurse training places have been cut back in recent years and training and education have been undermined as a result.  Similarly, will the HSE, as an employer, be able to fulfil the obligation under Section 92 to facilitate the maintenance of professional com<Col N="795"/>petence of registered nurses and midwives pursuant to a professional competence scheme?  The Bill also states that the employer &ldquo;may&rdquo; facilitate this by providing learning opportunities in the workplace. Again, how realistic is this under the current regime and its attacks on our health services?  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, as often referred to in the House regarding other legislation is, potentially, a get-out clause and a means of ignoring its responsibilities on the part of the HSE.  That needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>As the INMO has stated in regard to the Bill, we must ensure that the necessary infrastructure for nurse and midwife undergraduate and post-graduate education is in place and maintained.</P>
        <P>All those points being made, I commend the Bill and look forward to its enactment.  Sinn F&eacute;in Members will support its passage through all Stages.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Nurses and Midwives Bill.  I acknowledge that Irish nurses and midwives are renowned all over the world.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in stated, all of us have had experience at first-hand of their professional and caring nature.  I wish to put on record my appreciation of the great work they do.  As was noted, they do not always get the recognition they deserve in media commentary and mention.  </P>
        <P>Nurses and midwives have been to the forefront in the health care profession in progressing and changing their roles to meet the needs of their patients, always with a patient-centred focus.  They perform critical functions.  Nurses and midwives are often the first contact person people will meet in the health service.  There is a very special relationship between the nurse or midwife and the expectant mother.  I commend them for their professionalism and caring nature.  They take their responsibilities very seriously.  They carry out their daily functions to an extremely high standard and deliver a service to thousands on a daily basis, often in a quiet manner.  They do so to enhance our health service.</P>
        <P>It is heartening to see that nursing and midwifery are still popular choices among our young students.  Leaving certificate students remain very interested in the profession.  They see it as a caring profession, one where their individual characters, personalities and skills could, and in the future will be used to provide a vital service to patients.</P>
        <P>Since the Nurses Act was introduced in 1985 we have witnessed major changes in our health services.  These are reflected in the way services are delivered to the public.  In more recent times we have seen a greater concentration in the delivery of services in the community with the setting up of the primary care teams and centres where services are delivered to patients in a much more community-based focus.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P Just="Left">The public is looking for improvements in patient safety and this, in itself, would help to build patient confidence.  I welcome the fact that more than 200 individuals, organisations and representative groups engaged in the consultation process.  They saw it as important, felt they had something they wished to contribute and wanted their views to be taken into consideration.  Those people have the benefit of the working experience and of dealing with patients.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, reflected carefully on these submissions in the preparation of this Bill to ensure the balance was right, that the public was protected and that nurses and midwives were benefiting by the putting in place of a proper <Col N="796"/>framework.  That will ensure they are dealt with in a manner comparable to other health care professionals.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the word &ldquo;midwives&rdquo; is used in the Title.  It is very important that they are recognised as being separate and distinct from nurses because, since the 1950s, midwives have been classed under the banner of nursing.  I welcome that the group will be seen as distinct and the name of the body will reflect that in the nursing and midwifery board of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The board&rsquo;s objective will be to protect the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the integrity of the practising of nursing and midwifery through the promotion of higher standards of professional education, training, practice and professional conduct among nurses and midwives.  I welcome that the Minister has broadened the membership of the board to include the many different stakeholders in the health service, the public and the education sector.  It is a good and balanced mix.</P>
        <P>Nurses and midwives will have the opportunity to elect eight representatives to the board and at least three of the members must be engaged in clinical practice, which is very important.  These people have valuable expertise and information to share from daily contact with patients and the public.</P>
        <P>I welcome the new register for advanced nurse practitioners and advanced midwife practitioners.  These roles are clearly defined and these nurses and midwives work at an advanced level.  In order to have public protection, it is necessary for structures and governance procedures to be in place.  There is a demand for a comprehensive fitness to practise structure, which can act in a speedy and appropriate manner when individuals make a complaint.  One would hope that would be the exception rather than the norm.</P>
        <P>Complaints will be assessed by the preliminary proceedings committee before the board makes a decision on the necessity to hold a full fitness to practise inquiry.  Investigators will be appointed if necessary to facilitate investigations, which is very important for both patient and public confidence.  A mediation process will deal with less serious complaints.  There are nine grounds on which people can complain, including professional misconduct, poor professional performance and inappropriate behaviour.  To have those listed in a clear manner will be of great assistance to the public.</P>
        <P>In this country our nurses and midwives have a very high standard of education and training which is recognised the world over.  The new degree programme has contributed in a positive way but nurses and midwives, like all other professionals, require ongoing professional development.  Gone are the days when a person could qualify and just get a degree; there is a great need for ongoing professional development and support for all professionals, and specifically nurses and midwives.  This development contributes to the maintenance of a very high level of competence, which ensures that patient safety is rightly at the heart of everything.</P>
        <P>That issue is the focus of this Bill and it will ensure greater public confidence in the services provided while supporting and enhancing the high standards in education, training and competence in nurses and midwives.  Like the Minister, I look forward to its early enactment following careful consideration on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to briefly contribute to this debate as this Bill will bring fundamental changes to the way nurses and midwives go about their business.  The profession is often taken for granted, as it was in the past.  As previous speakers have mentioned, Irish nursing has always had a good reputation not just within Ireland but internationally.  There has always been a big demand for Irish-trained nurses around the world and we must recognise the contribution of religious orders over many years in upholding that reputation, as they formed a big part of how nursing was portrayed in Ireland.</P><Col N="797"/>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The profession, particularly midwifery and specialised nursing areas, changes on an almost daily basis.  There are new medical techniques, medications and treatments almost weekly and nursing plays a significant part in how those treatments are presented to people.  People are very vulnerable in hospital, especially in maternity cases, and patients expect and deserve the highest standards.  This Bill will ensure transparency and accountability in the profession for the patients and those using the services of nurses and midwives.  At the same time it will provide adequate protection to those professionals providing the service, which is a key element of the Bill.  It will ensure protection on both sides of the equation as there will be adequate coverage in how a patient is treated while protecting the professionals.</P>
        <P>There are very strong requirements under the Bill relating to regulation and governance which cover nursing in general and the midwifery area in particular.  The protection exists for both clients and practitioners through the new requirements.  For example, there must be adequate insurance and there are stringent prohibitions on unregistered nurses.  There is an adequate registration process with a constant review, which is a key element.  Ongoing review of how nurses are trained and educated, and how they fulfil daily duties, is a fundamental part of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, mentioned in her speech that the educational requirements for nursing have changed drastically over a number of years.  The introduction of degree qualifications and ongoing training and education while in the job has led to people being highly experienced and qualified, particularly in the specialist areas of nursing.  The nursing profession today is a far cry from the days when nurses were not given proper recognition and treated differently.  People took the service for granted and patients automatically assumed that only a basic service was provided by nurses.</P>
        <P>The changes from the past number of years have ensured that nurses in particular, along with midwives, get recognition of the importance of their service.  That has come about as a direct result of the change in the educational requirements in the professions.  This Bill further enhances the opportunities for the recognition of those qualifications, specifically by ensuring that employers and management in hospitals are obliged to facilitate nurses and midwives in maintaining their professional competence.</P>
        <P>It has always been an issue with nurses that if they wanted to go for promotion or change specialties, in many cases they had to do it in their own time.  The job is stressful and onerous enough without that.  This legislation will ensure that those with responsibility, including the HSE, will be obliged to facilitate ongoing training and educational opportunities for nurses and midwives.  That will be a significant improvement to the service.</P>
        <P>The spotlight has usually only been put on the nursing profession when there was a particularly nasty case of malpractice or abuse ending up in the media.  As a result of the highly personal nature of nursing, staff often find themselves in a position where they are open to false accusations while patients suffer due to incompetence.</P>

    <Title>Diversification of Primary School Provision: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I consider the future policy direction we adopt on the diversity of primary school provision to be one that has the potential to impact not just on the educational environment, but on society and our social and civic structures generally for many years to come.  I wanted this opportunity for statements from Members because I recognise that the many different and changing views in <Col N="798"/>contemporary Ireland are represented in the House.  Some Deputies opposite have been pressing me on the idea of a forum, but the best forum is this Chamber, where the opinions of Members, reflecting those of their constituents and communities, can be aired.</P>
        <P>In forming future policy, we must prioritise the views of parents and communities, views that are best reflected through Deputies.  This is not to exclude the knowledgeable insight of those managing and working in our system, but it is the case that the views of children and parents must come first in our considerations.</P>
        <P>In introducing the debate, it is important that I outline the progress made on several fronts in recent years.  Traditionally, primary schools have been under the patronage of religious authorities, and the vast majority under the patronage of the Catholic Church.  During the past 20 years, Educate Together has established 56 schools with a further two opening this September.  Several other school models have also been recognised in recent times, including the Steiner schools and the John Scottus school.  Two schools under the new community national school model are open with a further three to open this September.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As well as diversity of type of religion or ethos, there is increasing development of<?oasys _jy ?>gaelscoileanna, with 138 such schools in place.  That said, significant issues are emerging about the definitions and types of diversity that might be recognised and how they can be accommodated while maximising the effective use of existing and new infrastructure and educational expenditure generally, particularly at a time of scarce resources.</P>
        <P>Between 2002 to 2008, arrangements recommended by the Commission on School Accommodation operated for the recognition of new primary schools.  This provided that, where patrons approached the New Schools Advisory Committee, NSAC, and there was evidence of sufficient numbers to establish a school, a new school was established on a provisional basis and recognition was given on a permanent basis when the numbers were confirmed, subject to appropriate inspection by the inspectorate.  These arrangements have led to some increases in diversity.</P>
        <P>The NSAC raised a range of issues it believed needed to be considered in its work, including those related to the definition and identification of diversity and other criteria for recognising a new school.  The committee was acutely aware of the changed climate in terms of future enrolment trends and demands for recognition of new schools.  It also had concerns as to the continued relevance of its terms of reference, particularly in circumstances where some schools needed to be recognised directly by the Minister outside of the NSAC process in certain areas where new schools needed to be established at short notice to meet surges in pupil numbers.</P>
        <P>Another outcome of existing arrangements was that the State had supported the establishment of new schools in some areas where the population was not growing and could even have been declining.  The establishment of these schools also gave rise to increasing costs, both capital and recurring, while only some of them have assisted in meeting demographic increases.  Many of these schools started in temporary accommodation, which has added to the pressure on the limited primary schools capital budget at a time of significant demographic growth.</P>
        <P>Society has been changing and there are increasing calls for parental choice in the patronage of primary schools.  While there has been a traditional concept of the local primary school that can meet the needs of the majority of those living locally, this has increasingly been coming into question and, particularly in urban areas, there has been an increasing tendency for children to attend schools of various types that are not necessarily their nearest schools.  These changes have meant that we have needed to examine many of the aspects of the primary schools system that have been in place traditionally or were put in place in recent years to cater for diversity.</P><Col N="799"/>
        <P>I wish to highlight three aspects of these developments.  The first relates to the development of a new type of primary school, the second to new arrangements for recognition of new primary schools and the third to the potential for the Catholic Church to divest patronage in some schools.  The Government will shortly publish for the House&rsquo;s consideration a Bill that will include provisions for the statutory underpinning of new community national schools.  I will make three main points in this respect.</P>
        <P>First, community national schools provide a model that, while fully respecting diversity of belief, allows for faith formation during the school day in accordance with the wishes of parents.  The emphasis in the community national school model is on respect for the diversity of cultures in our society.  One of its central purposes is to cater for diversity within a single school setting rather than in more than one school.  Historically, a considerable strength of our primary schools was that most students attended their local schools together.  The Government considered it important in an increasingly diverse society to determine whether we could develop a new model that would accommodate the greatest number of students in a community as possible.  The overwhelming emphasis in the multi-belief programme being developed for the schools is on inclusivity and children are taught a common programme together as a group for more than 80% of the time.  Differentiation takes place for short periods of faith-specific teaching as might happen in the teaching of any subject.  The pilot phase of this new model provides an important learning opportunity and its evaluation will enable informed decisions to be made on the roll-out of this model of patronage in other locations.  An important part of the evaluation will be an assessment of the impact of the schools on the local community.</P>
        <P>In the recent public commentary on how faith-specific teaching impacts on children, there has been little comparable debate on what has been the impact on communities of different children going to different schools rather than going to school together.  The impact on our communities of children going to different schools, rather than having all of the children or at least most of them being educated in the same school must surely be greater.  Furthermore, the State had a choice in considering the model for these schools.  The choice was to make them non-denominational and, therefore, unable to meet the needs of a parent seeking denominational education for his or her child or to make them multi-denominational and, thus, potentially able to cater for all children and to provide a choice in religious education, including the choice not to have denominational education.  There is no reason that, depending on community wishes and evolution over time, a non-denominational community school model could not be developed at some point.</P>
        <P>Second, until the establishment of these schools, the State facilitated patrons in taking the initiative for the establishment of primary schools.  This contrasts greatly with the role of the State in second level education where it has been actively involved in the establishment of schools for many years.  Is it not appropriate that, as a complementary alternative to existing patronage models, there should be a mechanism in place for the State to establish a primary school in a similar manner as it establishes a second level school?  The role of the State in establishing schools at second level has been significant and vocational education committees, VECs, can make an important contribution at primary level.</P>
        <P>Third, a situation can arise where a primary school needs to be established but no patron is willing to establish it.  The current system cannot require that a patron establish a school and, therefore, it is possible that a situation could arise where no patron wishes to establish a new primary school in a particular location despite a demand that would warrant its establishment.  The State cannot stand aside from an obligation in this regard.  I expect that, in addition to our opportunity today, we will have considerable debate on these issues on the introduction of the Bill to the House.</P><Col N="800"/>
        <P>My predecessor asked the Commission on School Accommodation to review the arrangements in place concerning the establishment of new primary schools.  The commission represents a range of education partners and I am awaiting advice from it that I expect to receive in the next month or so.  Pending receipt and consideration of this advice, the only new primary schools being established are those in response to demographic demand.</P>
        <P>In the commission&rsquo;s work, it also takes account of issues relating to diverse patronage models and the size of schools.  For example, if 32 classrooms are needed in a particular area, establishing four mainstream schools might not be the most effective use of resources.  On the other hand, not all primary schools should necessarily have 24 or classrooms.  These issues are being considered by the commission.  It has undertaken extensive consultation as part of its work.  In response to this, 27 submissions have been received and the most common themes received in the submissions were issues relating to shared campuses, planning and relationship of schools with local authorities, the issue of diversity and the minimum numbers of pupils required for the establishment of a new school.  I envisage that a summary of all the submissions received will be published by the commission when its advisory report to me is published.  All of this advice and background material on the views of various partners in education will feed into the decision-making process.</P>
        <P>One of the key issues in deciding the criteria for who should be the patron of a school will be how views are taken account of in coming to that decision.  The position in recent years had been that individual patron bodies indicated they had quantified the number of parents wishing to enrol children in infant classes.  However, that approach is confined to particular parents. There may be further options in surveying parents, and indeed prospective parents, on a wider basis in local communities to see what their views are if a range of options is identified for them.  There are particular challenges as some communities are only just developing themselves and schools are being established for people who do not yet live in a particular area.  I would see this as an issue that will need to be addressed in any new arrangements being put in place.</P>
        <P>In turn, this raises the issue which has been referred to by some Members of this House about the need for a national survey on the wishes of parents concerning the patronage of primary schools.  Having an understanding of the views of parents across society would be an important element in deciding on the future patronage of schools.</P>
        <P>We already have some views from the Catholic Church that it wishes to reduce its engagement in the patronage of primary schools, ultimately to a level consistent with the demand for Catholic education whatever that may be in the future.  I am not sure whether a national survey of parental preference on the patronage of primary schools would give a definitive road-map.  The expression in an overall survey can be a very general one, but when parents come to decide on the school to send their children to, a number of other factors beyond patronage can come into play, and the decision could be different from that which was expressed in an overall opinion survey.</P>
        <P>Parents can also be concerned about school performance, proximity and having their children attend the school their playmates in the community are attending.  Therefore, it is also important to develop arrangements to ascertain the views of parents at a local level in the context of knowledge about the choice of schools in the locality.</P>
        <P>In areas where new schools are needed to cater for demographic increases the needs of an increasingly diverse society through diversifying provision will be met.  As I indicated earlier, providing new schools in areas of stable or declining school population may not be the best way of using public resources.  Indeed, it may have unintended impacts on other school provision, yet we must tackle issues of diversity in these areas as well.  We will need to explore the <Col N="801"/>potential for different approaches and may need a multiplicity of approaches to address the different issues posed in individual areas depending on population diversity, existing school configuration and different local community and parental preferences.</P>
        <P>One possible approach, which I wish to refer to in some detail, is the issue of the Catholic Church divesting itself of certain schools.  This issue was originally raised by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin in the context of the overall number of primary schools in the archdiocese.  In subsequent discussions, the Catholic Church expressed a preference for my Department, rather than the church itself, to identify areas where potentially there might be too many Catholic schools compared to demand for such schools, as an initial step to allow them to consider those areas in more detail.  My Department agreed to examine a number of initial locations to see what scope or options might exist for a change of patronage in these cases.  The particular focus was on identifying a sample number of areas of relatively stable demographics where the establishment of new schools was unlikely to emerge in the foreseeable future and where the provision is exclusively Catholic, or there was a very limited diversity at present.</P>
        <P>The overall aim is that there will be a list of sample areas which can then be used to try the modalities by which the number of Catholic places in schools will be reduced and released for others.  The focus is initially on looking at urban areas where there are a number of Catholic schools and where the population is likely to be sufficient to support a number of schools of diverse type.</P>
        <P>There was some criticism in this House when this was discussed in the context of parliamentary questions two weeks ago.  It was expressed that it will not be possible for the Catholic Church to consult within its community and the schools stakeholders, including teachers and other employees, on whether there is a willingness to divest their interest in particular schools.  I would not want to assume that this would be the case.  I wish to give the opportunity to the Catholic community to have such an engagement and to come back to me.  I consider it is very important that this concept is tested to see if it will work before dismissing it as not being able to work.  I certainly agree that if, as a result of such discussions, some schools are identified these can be used for testing the modalities.</P>
        <P>I am hopeful that the outcome of the discussions with the Catholic Church will lead to the trialling of divesting arrangements and we can then learn from this.  It may be that it is successful in some areas and may not work in others.  I recognise that this may not give us the full solution to the future development of school patronage either, but I consider that this has the potential to play a major role.  We may need to think of other approaches that we should take and I am open to hearing suggestions in this regard.</P>
        <P>This is a very important time for discussion on these issues.  We are at a key stage of development and testing in this area and I am open to hearing the views of everyone in this House on potential ways forward.  There will be some further opportunities in the House in the near future for views on particular aspects of the areas of work that I have outlined, particularly in the context of the discussion on community national schools, to which I have alluded.</P>
        <P>I am committed to further consultation with the education partners and with the wider public.  I have an open mind about the extent and nature of such further consultation at present.  I recognise that as developments are advanced it may be helpful to have a national discussion, as has been suggested.  I will listen to the views of everyone here today about how they think such consultation should be undertaken and will consider this in the context of the progress on the issues to which I have referred.  I thank the House for allowing me this opportunity to outline my views.  This is a listening exercise for me in order to ascertain what Members of the House have to say.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>For the past three years, I have been one of the Opposition spokespersons on education.  The public debate on ownership, control and patronage of our schools has been waged on the airwaves and in newspapers, but it has effectively taken three years for the matter to be discussed in this House.  The T&aacute;naiste now says that she wants to engage in a debate and she sees this House as the vehicle for doing so.  We are coming at this very late, however, and in an unstructured manner.  If one wanted to organise a debate involving all the stakeholders in Irish education, including the patrons and partners, one would not do it this way.  </P>
        <P>This debate has raged for many years, yet now &mdash; one minute to midnight, as it were &mdash; our national Parliament is holding the first ever debate in this area.  It is not the way we should be doing business.  I want to hear the comments of colleagues on all sides of the House, but I also want to hear in a structured, public way the views of the patrons, parents, teachers and their representatives.  That should happen in a way that allows for proper dialogue and debate.  Statements do not allow for that, however, even through the elected Members of this House.  We need a national forum which could sit publicly, similar to the forum established in the 1980s on Northern Ireland, as a means of teasing out all these issues.  They are complicated issues, which are tinged by history and culture.  We will not arrive at an easy solution on this because of that very debate.  I repeat my call for a national forum on education to deal exclusively with the patronage, control and ownership of our schools.</P>
        <P>We are meeting today on the first anniversary of the publication of the Ryan report.  If ever there was a low point in Irish public administration, it was in respect of the indemnity deal negotiated on that very issue by the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessors and the Department of Education and Science.  Many of the issues in that report are intermingled with those we are discussing today.</P>
        <P>I wish to enunciate two fundamental principles at the start of this debate, which are enshrined in Article 42 of our Constitution.  First, parents are the kings in Irish education.  The idea that the parent is the natural educator of their child is a fundamental constitutional prerequisite which we should all hold dear, and which remains within our Constitution.  Any deviation from that view is false and wrong.  If Catholic parents wish to send their children to Catholic schools, this State has an obligation and right to support that choice.  If Protestant parents wish to send their children to Protestant schools, this State also has an obligation and a right to defend that.  Equally, if parents who have no religious denomination choose to send their children to non-denominational or even interdenominational schools, Members have an obligation to support that right.  This constitutes a starting point for me.</P>
        <P>However, the other starting point is that difference is a good thing within Irish education.  The fact that we have different schools within primary and post-primary education is a matter for celebration and is a positive feature of the Irish education system.  If one goes back to the first foundation point for national school education, namely, the famous Stanley letters of the 1830s from the Chief Secretary for Ireland, the underlying idea was the concept of difference and choice.  It is a fundamental part of this debate.</P>
        <P>In addition, ideology has no part of this debate either.  People do not want schools to be turned into an ideologically obsessed schooling system.  As for this debate, ideology should be left at the doorstep and the debate should be open and honest.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise the extraordinary contribution made by the churches and by the Catholic Church in particular to Irish education over the years.  When this State had neither the will nor the finances to support Irish education, the Catholic Church was doing so free gratis.  I also wish to acknowledge that most of the heavy lifting in respect of welcoming new<Col N="803"/>comer children to Ireland has been done by Irish Catholic schools.  This point has not been recognised in much of the commentary on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a good point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The truth is that Catholic schools in Ireland are Catholic with a small &ldquo;C&rdquo; rather than a large &ldquo;C&rdquo;.  While it may be that some of that church&rsquo;s members seek more Catholic-driven schools in which Catholic social doctrine would be communicated, this is not my experience.  The great majority of Catholic schools in this country are ordinary national schools.  They are Catholic with a small &ldquo;C&rdquo; and are not akin to Pakistani madrassa school that are driven by an ideological religious bent.  They are an outcome of historical circumstance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not any more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>They certainly are not any more and this point must be recognised.  However, listening to some commentators, one would have thought they are a kind of ideologically driven school, which is not the case.  A significant number of children in these schools come from homes in which the parents may be baptised Catholics but are not part and parcel of the Catholic Church on a weekly or monthly basis.  However, that is fine because they are local national schools.</P>
        <P>I am not convinced by the argument that parents throughout the country are obsessed by the issue of patronage on an annual, daily or weekly basis.  In common with the T&aacute;naiste and Deputy Quinn, I travel around the country visiting many schools and the great majority of parents speak to me about buildings, special needs assistants, teachers, principals and quality.  They are not obsessed by the issue of school patronage.  However, I also recognise that a significant minority of parents are concerned that they lack the choice within their locality of a different form of school that reflects their ethos and particular view of the world.  Consequently, Members have an obligation to provide this.</P>
        <P>As a starting point, I wish to set out some ideas I have on this subject, on the basis that the T&aacute;naiste is in listening mode today.  I am familiar with what the T&aacute;naiste had to say regarding my comments concerning a survey.  I want the Department of Education and Skills to organise it.  While I am fascinated to read opinion polls in <i>The Irish Times </i>and to hear what the Iona Institute might tell me, the Department of Education and Skills should organise a simple survey of every parent in the country to ascertain their views on this issue to gauge how widespread is the dissatisfaction with the present set-up.  The T&aacute;naiste is the appropriate person to do this as it is her job, not some other organisation which may have an ideological bent one way or the other.  It would be good to have some direct information on this issue.  The T&aacute;naiste is not in favour of the form, which I consider to be a missed opportunity.  An opportunity for public bilaterals is required, rather than the private bilaterals that take place at present between some of the patrons and the Department.  The idea of a survey is a means of achieving this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Every new school that has been established over the past 15 years effectively has been one for which the land has been purchased by the State and the buildings have been provided by the State.  Such schools then have been leased to a patron, be it Catholic, Protestant, Educate Together, Gaelscoileanna or whatever.  I believe this is the format that must be arrived at in virtually the entire school system.</P>
        <P>I also believe the State should own the lands and buildings of all education facilities but that it should lease out to various education providers, that is, patrons, those buildings for the purposes of those educational facilities.  This is important because it is not the responsibility of the Catholic Church, the Protestant churches or any other church to fund school buildings.  It is the responsibility of taxpayers to so do and without fund-raising it is very difficult to get <Col N="804"/>together the funds to allow a school to proceed.  In the long term, we should be working towards a point at which all buildings should be in the ownership of the State but leased out to patrons as a means of providing education for the purposes of the ethos of those patrons and the parents who want those patrons.  This is a development that should happen.</P>
        <P>I am very interested in what has happened at post-primary level in recent years, whereby the religious orders have reorganised themselves into educational trusts.  This is a useful new development in which effectively, the nuns, brothers and priests have established new educational trusts for the purposes of providing schools within the voluntary sector.  This should be considered as a model for primary education.  The idea that schools should come under the direct control of a bishop and a diocese is very dated.  The Catholic Church is considering a review of dioceses as a current issue, for instance.</P>
        <P>However, it would be useful to examine the concept of trusts, as established at a post-primary level, to ascertain whether it could work out at primary school level as well.  Effectively, one would have a trust that would have the opportunity to provide schools throughout the country on a centralised basis.  As many parish priests who are on multiple boards of management have told me, they find it difficult to attend meetings of all these boards.  While I will not mention names in the House, this is a real issue for the church.  I believe the church has a responsibility to ascertain whether the manner in which the patronage model is rolled out can be reorganised and can be done on a more sensible basis.  Consequently, what has happened at post-primary level is interesting.</P>
        <P>Issues also arise in respect of boards of management.  An increase in the number of parents&rsquo; representatives on such boards should be considered.  At present, they have eight members, two of whom effectively are parents&rsquo; representatives.  Why should this not be increased?  In some areas with big or small schools, the opportunity of having a single board of management for a number of schools should be considered.  Such a clustering idea could be examined as a means of achieving greater efficiencies and of allowing the affected schools to achieve their goals in their own localities.  While many measures can be taken in this regard, ultimately it will require a public debate because none of these things will happen overnight.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste spoke about the new community school model.  If ever there was an example of how dysfunctional is the Department of Education and Science, it is on this issue.  At present two such schools are operating in County Dublin.  I understand that next year, additional community national schools will open in counties Kildare and Meath as well.  However, the requisite legislation has not passed through this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>For a very good reason.  It is not constitutional.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On the basis of the religious tuition.  I have legal opinion that the T&aacute;naiste is right in saying section 10 of the Education Act allows the State to be a patron but it does not specify in the section which bodies within the State can be patrons, it does not say only the VEC or any other State structure can do it.  We have set these schools up without any legislative underpinning.  If ever there was an example of the Department of Education and Skills at its legislative worst, it is surely this.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Quinn pointed out, there is a constitutional issue on the question of religious tuition within those schools.  If we read Professor Coolahan&rsquo;s evidence to the Supreme Court on a number of cases, it sums things up well &mdash; we have never had State schools in Ireland, rather a State-supported system of schooling.  Outside of the model schools, which were historically State schools, and the new VEC schools, we have a system of supporting various schools that are in place.</P><Col N="805"/>
        <P>I question whether the State can support denominational education where it provides it through the VEC model.  That is now happening in these two new schools and will be extended.  Why has this legislation not been introduced?  Why have we not had the ten areas?</P>
        <P>When Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe was Minister for Education and Science, he issued a press statement every minute, with big ideas that were not thought out but were designed to grab a headline.  I hope we will not go back to that.  I implore the T&aacute;naiste to think about this.</P>
        <P>I  welcome this debate.  It should be in-depth and constructive, and held in a structured way outside this House but I cannot see that happening if we take the approach the Government is advocating.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for facilitating opening of this discussion.  I have had the honour and privilege of being a Minister of State in one Department and a Minister in four others.  My experience in shadowing the Department of Education and Skills, as it is now, is one that leads me to be believe the Department is malevolently dysfunctional.  I cite as a recent example that the Minister was just about to sit down when her speech, which was probably written between Friday and Tuesday of this week, was delivered to us.  It is a discourtesy to this House that is consistent with the behaviour of the Department of Education and Skills when appearing before the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science.  The Minister may recall that I made that point to her at the committee.  This practice must change because there are wonderful people in the Department of Education and Skills but the collective is dysfunctional.</P>
        <P>This debate on patronage is ideological, it is important and it must be addressed in terms of the 21st century but we must not lose sight of the day job: to ensure that our children, who only grow up once, do not become victims of an ideological debate conducted by adults who have long since had the benefit of emerging from the education system and who are pursuing different agendas in their adult life.  We have seen the victims of that in Britain, where the ideological debate has got in the way of the delivery of quality education in the classroom.</P>
        <P>I look forward to parsing and analysing the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  It contained some interesting observations.  There is a view expressed by some people that the Labour Party is statist in its activities in the delivery of certain services that are essential in a modern society.  In education, however, we are not statist, we fully support Article 42 of the Constitution in all its ramifications, and recognise the family as the primary centre of education and the right of parents to choose.  We fully support the Constitution in that the State should provide for primary education but not necessarily provide primary education.</P>
        <P>The history of the configuration of patronage is a history with which we are all familiar; the T&aacute;naiste will be acutely familiar with that divided community in Donegal.  All of us would have liked for the Stanley letter to have been upheld and for faith formation to have occurred after school hours within the framework of the buildings but all three religious communities, Catholic, Church of Ireland and Presbyterian, demanded that education be denominational and we have inherited that system.  There were great strides in the new curriculum in primary education introduced in 1971.  That new curriculum, however, effectively makes the Constitution incapable of delivering and vindicating the right of parents because faith formation is now an integral part of the entire day&rsquo;s work, rather than the old style, where a half hour was set aside for religious formation.  We have problems in this that will require a long dialogue to come to a resolution.</P>
        <P>A third of my constituents are not Catholics.  I do not support the view that the phrases &ldquo;non-Catholic&rdquo;, &ldquo;non-national&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-believer&rdquo; are appropriate.  We are all believers, everyone has a belief system.  In a republic, belief systems, no matter who or what they are, should be <Col N="806"/>respected as the right of the citizen to hold.  I believe in atheism; I was brought up in a Catholic household but, like all adults, I take charge of my own life and that is what I believe.  I am not a &ldquo;non-believer&rdquo;, a &ldquo;non-Catholic&rdquo; or a &ldquo;non-national&rdquo;.  The language that is used by the Department of Education and Skills is progressive in this area, the phrase &ldquo;new comer children&rdquo; is wonderfully welcoming in an area where we must be sensitive.</P>
        <P>In my part of the Republic of Ireland, there is now a phenomenon of &ldquo;compulsory Catholicism&rdquo;, where to get a child into a school in a built-up area where demand exceeds supply, and where previously the Catholic church was welcoming and open, and I never heard a charge of proselytising made against it, the church must ration scarce spaces and it does that by two criteria: a baptismal certificate for the child who wishes to enter the school system and a utility bill in the name of the parents indicating that they live in the community.  When the White Paper on education was published in the 1990s, one of the challenges then assessed was how this State would manage the decline in primary school numbers.  Last week at the Joint Committee on Education and Science, we heard how we face an explosion in numbers now.  Between now and 2016, there could be a 20% increase in the school population.</P>
        <P>Demographic predictions like this are easy to make; the children born this evening in Holles Street and the Rotunda will be eligible for primary school entrance in four years.  It is impossible, however, to get a school extension through the school building unit in Tullamore in less than five years unless the school is on an emergency track.  We are not capable of responding to demand.  Children only grow up once, they only go through fourth class once and if they do not learn to read between third and fifth class, they immediately fall behind because for the rest of their education they are reading to learn.  We must remember that.</P>
        <P>I like the idea of a diversity of choice of patron.  I do not hold a candle for any particular group.  However, I like the multi-denominational nature of Educate Together.  Educate Together has travelled a long path, made some mistakes and corrected earlier decisions, and has come to a conclusion whereby faith formation is provided for in its school buildings but outside school hours.</P>
        <P>I will read the Minister&rsquo;s speech and come back to her on it but I will attempt to do justice to it now from memory.  She stated in a rather dismissive but highly defensive way &mdash; whoever wrote the speech knew exactly what he or she was saying &mdash; that in primary schools for 80% of the time there is no distinction or segregation in the classroom, but that for a certain period of time there is segregation for faith formation.  When we finally discuss the legislation to give statutory basis for the schools of which she is currently patron, where there is no parental representation, will the Minister or someone on her behalf describe to us what happens during that 20% of time in the classroom when there is segregation?  How is that segregation made?  I want the House &mdash; this republican assembly &mdash; to be told exactly how their children will be treated when that 20% of the time occurs, when the four categories of children are labelled, when that principle authority figure &mdash; the font of all knowledge &mdash; the school teacher, 80% or 90% of whom are women, with all the maternal characteristics that involves states to one group that they belong to the Catholic Church and that they will be taught faith formation; but to another group that it is Christian so must stay in another part of the room; to another that it is Muslim and must stay over there; and to another that they are non-believers.  What message in a republic in the 21st century are we giving each other?  What is a Donegal Deputy from the edge of the Border saying to the rest of us, from a part of the island ravaged by sectarian divisions?</P>
        <P>There is a better model and that is to provide for faith formation and to facilitate parents who want it and to use the resources and to have those resources provided in the school outside school hours.  That is what the Stanley letter was about; that is what the original curriculum <Col N="807"/>was about; and that is what Article 42 is about, where parents have the right to send their child to the nearest school even if that is not of the ethos of their choice.  Equally, within that right to go to what are predominantly Catholic schools, they have the right to ask that their child be removed from the classroom for the half an hour before break in the morning.  However, this is no longer possible because of the new curriculum.  I attended Catholic schools week on 28 January where I learned that religion informs the entire day&rsquo;s teaching; there is no 30 minute period when religion or faith formation is provided.</P>
        <P>This is about much more than faith formation and ideology.  It is about mobilising the beliefs and values of our republican Constitution to the 21st century.  It is about recognising the rights of parents, as primary educators in the first instance and as people involved in exercising parental choice.  In my constituency, the present system effectively excludes one third of constituents, not counting those who may nominally be Catholics but are catholics with a small &ldquo;c&rdquo;, as Deputy Hayes stated.</P>
        <P>We get great outcomes from our educational system, and this is a tribute to the Department of Education and Skills, the teachers, the VEC and everybody else involved.  Notwithstanding our relatively low spend in the educational system we get outcomes that are above average in most areas.  This is for a number of reasons, including the quality of our teachers and the educational achievements they are required to have to enter the teaching system; the commitment of all patron bodies in varied forms, and there are first division players and third division players as there are in all walks of life; the extraordinary commitment of the 20,000 volunteers who go on boards of management; the extraordinary lonely and heroic role played by principals in our primary school system, notwithstanding the onus of governance that is incessantly thrust upon them by circulars from the Department of Education and Skills; and, coming back to my first point, the commitment that parents have to education.</P>
        <P>The Constitution was drafted in the 1930s, when Europe was preparing to tear itself apart again in a savage world war, more likely a second European civil war if the truth were known, and it reflects the landscape of the demography of this island at that time.  That demography has changed.  The fastest growing faith group in this country are non-believers, to contradict my earlier exhortation but to put it in language that people can understand.  These are people who profess to have no religious belief.  They have to be found a place in the same way as a place was found for previous cohorts of Irish citizens in this republic.  That is why I endorse fully the request from Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, who wants help.  He is the biggest patron of primary schools in the country and he wants help from us to divest in an orderly manner so that the remaining schools he has under his patronage can become fully-blown unashamedly Catholic schools.  He wants our help and the Minister is refusing it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>She stated she does not like the idea of a forum.  She does not want it and her predecessor refused it.  What is wrong with the Department of Education and Skills?  There is the model of the convention on education chaired by Professor John Coolahan in Dublin Castle.  Every stakeholder attended.  It is all on the public record.  The Catholic archbishop of this diocese, which is the largest diocese in the country, is the biggest patron of primary schools, with just over 500, and he wants our help and asked for it more than a year ago.</P>
        <P>The conference that took place at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham last year was a farce.  It was announced on the eve of the INTO conference as a headline grabber.  Anyone who participated in it &mdash; I was not able to do so because we were not invited properly but I could not have gone anyway &mdash; stated it was a series of statements and there was no dialogue.  We had <Col N="808"/>the forum on a new Ireland, and fora on Europe.  We have been very good at resolving differences and respecting individuality in citizens through social partnership in other areas.  Let us go down that proven path, which has worked in other areas where there cannot be consensus.</P>
        <P>Whatever we do, we must not disrupt the day job.  A child comes of age only once.  Children&rsquo;s experience and learning in the classroom is so precious and unique that people like me, administrators in education and those concerned with it cannot disrupt it.  Whatever way we conduct the rest of this debate, it must be in the knowledge and understanding that the day job, conducted by parents, teachers and pupils, will continue undisrupted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas agus f&aacute;ilte as an deis labhairt ar an cheist r&iacute;-th&aacute;bhachtach seo.  Ceist &aacute;mharach &iacute; seo lenar c&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn d&eacute;ile&aacute;ille&iacute; i bhfad roimhe seo.</P>
        <P>There is a desperate need for diversity in our schools, especially in an Ireland which is growing to include many different cultures, nationalities and religions.  Everyone will be in agreement when I state that the structure we have at present is outdated and unsustainable.  The separation of church and State must be completed.  Today, the State pays for education through capitation grants, teachers&rsquo; salaries and a range of other funding.  This funding is not enough but we will not go into that.  The vast majority of primary and secondary schools are not under democratic control.  They are predominantly under the patronage of Catholic bishops and in the ownership of the Catholic Church.  This is a legacy of an old era of ecclesiastical power and control.  This must change and we must move to a democratically-controlled education system, truly representative of the community we have today and respecting the rights of people of all religions and none, and a school system that is totally children-centred.</P>
        <P>There is a clear need for change and the Catholic Church itself has acknowledged an oversupply of Catholic national schools, and has recognised the need for a far more balanced provision to the benefit of all providers.  The structure of primary education is out of synch with stated population preferences.  Some 98% of our schools are under some denominational control while only 58% of parents support continued church management.</P>
        <P>The Educate Together model of primary schools mentioned by other Deputies and the long-established model of multi-denominational secondary schools under the patronage of vocational education committees, VECs, have provided a template of where we need to go from here.  VECs must be supported, strengthened and given the structures needed to provide multi and non-denominational schools in a manner which is wholly accountable and managed by the community.  In my area I have been lobbied by quite a number of constituents who want their children to be educated in multi-denominational schools, of which there are already a number which are quite successful.</P>
        <P>The Portobello Educate Together start-up group is seeking recognition so that it can establish a multi-denominational school which is needed to serve an area with a large population, that is, Dublin 2, 6, 8 and 12.  The start-up group involves 180 parents at this stage and has pre-enrolment forms completed for more than 100 children.  It has also secured temporary premises.  I call on the Minister to act now to make this school available to the children in the constituency in time for September 2011 at the latest.  This can be done by making provision for an additional school, which is the desired model, or by intervening to secure the prompt transfer of patronage from one of the existing Catholic schools.  I understand the education secretary of the Dublin archdiocese indicated that transferring patronage of a school in the area to a multi-denominational patron is something it was quite open to considering.  That needs to be progressed and the Minister&rsquo;s intervention in this is necessary to accelerate this process.</P>
        <P>When it comes to the delivery of primary education parental choice must be recognised as a paramount consideration.  I have been lobbied by the parents to which I referred and others <Col N="809"/>who have had their children on several waiting lists for multi-denominational schools since birth, but in many cases there is no chance that they will manage to get the school of their choice because there are not enough Educate Together non-denominational schools in the area to meet the demand.</P>
        <P>Griffith Barracks National School is another Educate School which is quite successful and is bursting at the seams.  It was recognised by the Department because it said it could go the public private partnership route.  The public private partnership collapsed and the school is still in old barracks which was unfit for soldiers but which is now being used for a school.  The school did a great deal of work to try to ensure it is fit for use as a school.  It also uses prefabricated buildings.  That situation cannot continue.  A new building, built by the State, is needed.  It should not be procured through public private partnership but through investment because it is an investment in education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another situation which is absolutely scandalous is that of gaelscoileanna.  A new gaelscoil has not received recognition since 2008.  This State should create demand for gaelscoileanna, not answer the demand &mdash; ag cruth&uacute; &eacute;ilimh seachas &eacute; a sh&aacute;samh.  N&iacute;l an St&aacute;t ag s&aacute;samh an &eacute;ileamh at&aacute; ann do ghaelscoileanna ar fud na t&iacute;re.  N&iacute;l aon aitheantas &aacute; thabhairt ag an St&aacute;t do ghaelscoileanna nua agus n&iacute;l an cuma air go n-athr&oacute;idh s&eacute; sin i mbliana.  A new gaelscoil will not be granted patronage for 2010 and this is a terrible indictment of the Government&rsquo;s unwillingness to accept that demographics are changing and that parents are choosing to have their children educated through Irish.  They have a right to do so and the State needs to facilitate that right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Gabhaim comhghairdeas leo si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh seasaimh chr&oacute;ga ar son Gaelscoil R&aacute;th T&oacute;.

        <P>The gaelscoil in R&aacute;th T&oacute; will open in September 2010 regardless of the decision of the State not to acknowledge it and which has refused it patronage.  There is huge demand for the gaelscoil but the Department refuses to differentiate between new schools on the basis of the language of tuition.  This means that the Irish language rights of parents and children are being disregarded.  That  cannot continue.  We need serious change in the criteria for recognition of new schools, which is currently stacked against the Irish language schools, the result of which is that no new Gaelscoil has been approved since 2008 and there is no indication to date that the Government and Department are willing to move on that situation, mo n&aacute;ire sibh.</P>
        <P>I referred to my area.  In replies to parliamentary questions which I put to the Minister she seems to avoid giving direct answers to direct questions regarding my constituency and that never bodes well.  In her most recent response she stated that a technical group is considering &ldquo;the issue of how best to measure or gauge the views of parents in relation to diversity of school provision in a locality&rdquo;.  The instance of Portobello Educate Together, for which 180 parents are formally seeking a multi-denominational school and the 200 or 300 children on a waiting list for Griffith Barracks Educate Together and Ranelagh Educate Together, respectively, speaks for itself.  There are thousands of parents who have children on waiting lists for gaelscoileanna, which also speaks for itself.</P><Col N="810"/>
        <P>I invite the Minister to give a commitment that the Government will provide multi-denominational schools for all of these children and will expedite and give serious consideration to the transfer of patronage from existing Catholic schools if the Catholic Church, as it seems to have indicated to date, is willing to consider this.  If such a transfer cannot happen then the State has to step in and build schools.  The investment by the State in schools could be part of the reconstruction of our economy.  It could create schools to meet the demand up and down the country and deal with the issues of patronage, prefabricated buildings, parental choice and language choice for children at the same time.</P>
        <P>Diversity in schools also means recognising the differing strengths and weaknesses of the individual students.  Programmes such as the leaving certificate applied, the leaving certificate vocational programme and Youthreach have made huge inroads into combating disadvantage and offering a different type of education for different needs.  Such programmes should be protected and championed.</P>
        <P>I refer to another issue.  Senior Traveller training centres will be subject to a 25% cut this summer, a cut equivalent to 300 places across the State.  It is no good talking about diversity in the education system when this Government is slashing funding from one of the most marginalised groups in society.</P>
     
        <P>Such a cut should not happen.  If the Government is serious about promoting diversity in schools, it should not proceed with any of the cuts which will undermine the great work done to deliver diversity in our education system.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is a need for us to move on as a society, to provide more choice in our education system, to throw out the archaic system of religious control over education and to recognise the different levels of ability in education.  The Government has an opportunity to take a stand.  It must be imaginative and realise this issue will not go away.  We are growing up as a society and our education system must reflect that, but it will not do so if we implement cuts to the detriment of the key component of an education system, the child.  If those cuts continue, they will have a detrimental effect on the education of the child and on parents and society as a whole.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to recognise and invest in Educate Together schools which have jumped through every hoop put in place by the Department.  As soon as they reach a target, the criteria changes or the Department blocks it.  That is the biggest scandal.  These groups work voluntarily; they are not paid officials or Deputies.  These people come together and put their time and effort into planning.  When a target is reached, the rules and regulations change or there is a delay for another two or three years.  The Minister and the Government are delaying recognition of these schools which have met all the criteria.  That issue must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister and the Government to change their stance and invest in these schools, not in prefabricated buildings but in proper buildings.  If we invest in them now, it will pay dividends over time.  This should not be done by way of public private partnerships but by the State.  That commitment would show the children and the parents that the State respects their education and contribution to the education system.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to share time with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe.  De bharr nach bhfuil ach c&uacute;ig n&oacute;im&eacute;id agam, d&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; tr&iacute; phointe r&eacute;as&uacute;nta tapaidh.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Along with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, I have a particular interest in Gaelscoileanna.  I hope the Department will consider to where a primary school pupil should go after attending a Gaelscoil. T&aacute; easpa me&aacute;nscoileanna ann.  I mo cheantar f&eacute;in, t&aacute; Gaelscoil Bhaile Brig&iacute;n, Gaelscoil Ros <Col N="811"/>Eo, Gaelscoil Bhrian B&oacute;roimhe agus Gaelscoil an Duinn&iacute;nigh.

T&aacute; plean ann chun gaelchol&aacute;iste &mdash; Col&aacute;iste Ghl&oacute;r na Mara &mdash; a bhun&uacute; i mBaile Brig&iacute;n.  T&aacute; breis is 300 dalta ar an liosta cl&aacute;raithe.  Bun&oacute;far an gaelchol&aacute;iste sin, le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;.  Iarraim ar an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don phlean agus an gaelchol&aacute;iste a chead&uacute; go luath.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Even before we deal with ownership and patronage, we need to iron out a few ground rules, or perhaps establish some new ones.  We must make applying for a place in a primary school more straightforward for parents who are very often left in a desperate situation full of uncertainty having applied to every primary school in an area.  In a growing area like my area of north county Dublin, parents might have to apply to up to eight schools and, metaphorically speaking, prostrate themselves and ask for a place for their child.  They may not hear anything for months.</P>
        <P>A parent I spoke to today heard nothing and was given no hope only to be offered three places for her child.  The three principals in that case are working in splendid isolation and are, in effect, offering a place three times over.</P>
        <P>We have a well established system for our third level institutions in the Central Applications Office.  It should not be beyond our imagination and ingenuity for each town to have a standard form on which parents put schools in order of preference.  The information could be processed in a straightforward and transparent way.  The State would know from where applications were coming and parents would know the system was transparent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The form could come with the first child benefit payment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>When Deputy Quinn is Minister for Education and Skills, he will no doubt act on that immediately.  We have that system at third level and it could be adapted to suit the needs at primary school level.  I look forward to that happening.</P>
        <P>The parent I spoke to today who was offered three places already has a daughter in another school which did not offer a place because it has an enrolment policy whereby the child comes first and the family does not get a look in so in the case of two siblings, the other sibling can go somewhere else.  There is a fundamental question not only about the right of the child, but also about the right of the child within the family and the stress being placed on the family by having to embark on not only one school journey in one direction, but on another school journey in another direction.  What is a single parent to do &mdash; make choices about which child arrives late at school or which child is left standing outside the school gate because the other child must be brought into the school?  While I fully agree with the ethos of and the reasoning behind the Educate Together movement, there is an essential flaw there whereby each child is taken at face value and siblings are not considered in the overall picture.</P>
        <P>I refer to green schools.  I heard on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, visited a school yesterday to encourage the minimisation of transport to and from school for social and environmental reasons.  That is an issue we could grasp in enrolment policy.  Let us consider the family as well as the child to minimise the stress and trauma involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Departments of Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse everything Deputy Sargent said.  The more clarity we can bring to the procedure, the better.  Prospective parents are often baffled by the admission procedure and by the Department of Education and Skills website.  All they want is clarity as to what to do and what chance they have of getting their child into a particular school, and I <Col N="812"/>am only talking about parents from Ireland.  When one talks to parents who have come here from abroad, they are completely mystified by the procedure for admission to schools.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>A good first step for the Minister would be to start with the Department of Education and Skills website.  Before I came into the House today, I logged onto the website and clicked the &ldquo;about us&rdquo; button, although there was nothing there.  I know quite a bit about the Minister and about how the Department operates, so the least we could do is to provide some good, clear information on the Department of Education and Skills website, which I think is stuck in 1996.  For a minimum effort, we could get a maximum result.  That is part of a process which has perhaps become unduly politicised over the years.  Once we get into the area of criteria, they must be verifiable.</P>
        <P>I looked at the bands for school projects.  The bands are obviously divided in sub-bands.  I could not find verifiable criteria as to how we define the level of priority of a school.  Is a rapidly developing area one developing by 1%, 3% or 5%?  If one cannot verify something, it is prone to interpretation, tweaking and political patronage.</P>
        <P>That is a dangerous road to follow.  We should put this information into the public domain and it should be verifiable, whether by CSO or Department of Education and Innovation statistics.  The sooner we move towards that objective, the better.</P>
        <P>This debate has to a large extent focused on the earthquake that has shook the Catholic Church in Ireland.  We have to re-examine our systems of patronage.  Parents should be able to send their children to primary schools which are close to where they live, in which either Irish or English is spoken and which offer a choice of religious patronage.  These simple choices should be available to every child in this State.</P>
        <P>We also need to investigate the issue of designating schools as disadvantaged.  In a sense, this is an on-off button approach in that either a school is designated or it is not.  A sliding scale would be more appropriate because designation carries considerable baggage, if not stigma.  By making available a broad range of supports ranging from schools which need major help in overcoming demographic, social and economic difficulties to ones which are doing well, we could break down some of our assumptions about schools in certain areas.</P>
        <P>All I could find from the Department&rsquo;s website was a list of areas that have experienced significant growth.  During a recent Adjournment debate, an Opposition Deputy produced a clear map which showed in colour coded form the exact level of growth experienced by various areas.  That type of information should be available from the Department&rsquo;s website without the need for a freedom of information request.</P>
        <P>The Minister is not long in her new job and she faces a major task.  The headline issue of the day is reducing our excessive dependence on the churches.  I have touched on several areas in which change can be implemented, including the simple step of improving the front end of the Department&rsquo;s website.  I wish the Minister well in her work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Minister stated that she will get from within the ranks of this House a sufficient variety of views to allow her to make a final decision on progress and reform but perhaps she is overestimating the variation of opinion among Deputies.  It is important that she would open the debate to the partners in the education system, namely, parents, school patrons, the churches and other interested parties.  I welcome that she has initiated a debate in this House so that we can make our views known.  We have waited two years for this debate and I commend her on taking this initiative so soon after taking up her current responsibilities.</P><Col N="813"/>
        <P>Interest in this issue resulted in large part from the controversy that arose from the requirement that children have baptismal certificates to enter certain primary schools.  This set an unfortunate tone for the debates that followed but, thank God, that has passed.</P>
        <P>The Archbishop of Dublin made an important intervention when he suggested that the church should consider divesting its patronage of schools.  While we must recognise that is unlikely to happen in certain traditional places such as small rural schools, reform is already occurring in major urban areas through Educate Together and Gaelscoileanna.  I acknowledge the fantastic work being done by the people behind these initiatives.  As Deputy Quinn noted, they acted swiftly to rectify mistakes as soon as they were identified.</P>
        <P>The increase in the number of Gaelscoileanna throughout the country has brought a significant advance in Irish education, particularly in regard to the language.  No distinction is made among children attending Gaelscoileanna, who come from working and middle class backgrounds and include groups which may have stronger views on education at primary level.</P>
        <P>I am glad today&rsquo;s debate has not focused on religion as a problem in education.  I feared the central question would be faith-based education, whether Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland or non-denominational but, thank God, this has not been the case.  I hope the debate will proceed on the basis of community spirit.  The most important question is how a child&rsquo;s education can be best delivered by the people charged with this responsibility.  We must emphasise the importance of parents, as a child&rsquo;s first educators, and the teachers who provide an education in the absence of parents during the school day.  The other issues, such as patronage, churches and bishops, pale into insignificance in comparison.</P>
        <P>A headline published today in a national newspaper referred to a church demand for additional payments towards maintenance and the existence of a huge divide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It was completely misleading.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted somebody else shares my view.  Some of the media commentary on these matters has been irresponsible and I hope commentators will in future be fair and, at the very least, offer an opportunity to everyone to participate in the debate.  It must be acknowledged, regardless of one&rsquo;s religious beliefs, that the Catholic Church has made a fantastic contribution to education over the years.  When resources were scarce they were nevertheless found, by whatever means, and efforts made to improve conditions for the delivery of education.  In order for children to be educated properly they must be content in the environment in which they are being taught.  Whatever resources are needed, within reason, should be made available to provide the best possible facilities for children in schools.</P>
        <P>I listened to what Deputy Quinn had to say about the segregation of pupils for 20% of the school day or week.  Given the increased diversity of our society, the prospect of the vocational education committees coming on board to provide a community-based education model, with parents, professionals and administrators represented, is welcome.  Any school that has not yet adopted a patron should give serious consideration to that model.  As Deputy Quinn said, it is important that there be transparency in the arrangements for the segregation of children during religious instruction and that no pupil is banished to the back of a class.</P>

Where it is found that there is sidelining of particular groups, there should be an obligation on the T&aacute;naiste and her Department to rectify it as a matter of urgency.  The danger is that it is always difficult to change any system that has taken root in a school.  A suitable accommodation must be made for those children whose parents do not want them to partake in religious instruction.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this timely debate and am encouraged by Members&rsquo; constructive contributions.  Most Deputies requested that ideology be left out of the debate and, fortunately, that has been the case thus far.  There was a concern that the debate might be used as an occasion to beat up the Catholic Church.  The Ryan report was published a year ago and since then we have had the Murphy report.  However, we must set aside our outrage at the findings of those reports for the purposes of this debate.  We must discuss the issue in a calm and rational way, which is how the debate is thus far proceeding.  Legacy issues in regard to child abuse and so on must be set apart from our deliberations today.  The D&aacute;il, as the forum of the people&rsquo;s representatives, has a crucial role to play in the national debate, as the T&aacute;naiste said.</P>
        <P>My constituency of Dublin North Central is a settled constituency whose population declined in the last census.  The majority of schools in the constituency are Catholic and most parents, regardless of their religion, are pleased to send their children to the local school for various reasons, including that it is local and convenient.  The local Catholic school usually has a great tradition in the community and a good reputation and the school principal and teachers are well known.  First Holy Communion and Confirmation are big days in the parish.  However, there are increasing calls, even in my constituency, for other options such as Educate Together schools.  It is important that the needs and interests of those parents are recognised.</P>
        <P>There has been much reference in this debate to the new arrangements for the recognition of primary schools.  A Bill will come before the House shortly to give legal recognition to that, which will offer further scope for debate on these issues.  In regard to faith formation, we are seeing a genuine attempt to deal with a complex area.  It is important to acknowledge that a significant portion of parents want their children to receive faith formation during the course of the school day.  That has been a feature of our education system for generations, but we now have a far greater diversity of faiths in the State.  As the T&aacute;naiste said earlier, is it not better, in accordance with parents&rsquo; wishes, that children of different faiths are educated under one roof for the majority of their school day rather than being sent to different buildings on opposite sides of the town in order that they receive the faith element of their education.  The community national school model is a new approach.  We will get aspects right but there inevitably will be a need for modifications as we see how it works in practice.  Practical issues arising in respect of religious instruction will offer lessons for the further roll-out of the model and it will continue to be monitored carefully.  I give that assurance to the House.</P>
        <P>I welcome the initiative by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin in regard to the divesting of schools.  I welcome the discussions that have taken place with the Department of Education and Skills and the work the Department is doing in this regard.  It will be difficult to move it on to the next phase and there undoubtedly will be controversies at a local level.  We must have widespread local consultation when the proposals are brought forward.  The Catholic Church will have a crucial role to play in that regard and in ensuring the proposals that emerge are practical <Col N="815"/>and enjoy broad support.  I welcome all these developments without underestimating the difficulties we face in proceeding with this task.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretConlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Margaret Conlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this discussion.  There has been much recent debate in the print media, on the airwaves and in other public fora in respect of the patronage of primary and second level schools.  It is unfortunate that the public commentary has not always been balanced.  Today&rsquo;s debate is essential and has been constructive thus far.  It is timely given the significant changes we have witnessed in our society in recent decades.  As a result of the rapid pace of social and demographic change, we have a radically altered and far more diverse society from which school communities are drawn.  This benefits young learners because it breaks down barriers, prejudices, attitudes and stigmas. </P>
        <P>I concur with Deputy Quinn&rsquo;s view on the dreadful term &ldquo;non-national&rdquo;.  I do not know what is the origin of the word.  We are all born somewhere and we are all going somewhere.  &ldquo;Newcomer&rdquo; is a much more welcoming and inclusive term.  When young children enter the playground at the start of their primary education, they do not regard themselves or others as different.  Religion is not an issue and the school is viewed as a community in which parents, who are the primary educators, teachers, the board of management and patrons work together for one purpose only, namely, the educational benefit of the children entrusted to their care.  This is a major responsibility on schools.</P>
        <P>The majority of schools are still under the patronage of the Catholic Church.  I recognise the role Catholic schools have played in the provision of education.  They have been to the forefront of the educational system and have played a prominent role in welcoming children from diverse backgrounds.  The challenge for these schools in future will be the need to change the composition of schooling.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a history of diversity in education, one which reflects the diverse needs and aspirations of learners and recognises that the education system must be responsive and dynamic if we are to meet the challenges of rapid regional and global change.  The debate on plurality of patronage often overlooks the fact that the State has for a long time provided a multidenominational alternative to denominational schools at second level.  The community national school at primary level is a new model.  As it is in transition, it will get certain things right and others wrong and will make whatever changes are required.  The new model is being piloted in two schools under the County Dublin Vocational Educational Committee.</P>
        <P>VECs have a proven track record, with more than 80 years experience in the management of second level schools.  The committees are democratic in the purest sense, consisting of elected public representatives and representatives of all relevant stakeholders.  They operate an open, transparent and accountable model of corporate governance.  I am aware that the Irish Vocational Education Association and Educate Together were in negotiations during which common ground was found.  I ask that these talks resume to further explore a model for the future.</P>
        <P>Parents want choice.  I am upset when I hear of cases of people queueing for two or three days to get their children into school or, as in the case of a person to whom I spoke recently, put the names of their newborn children on waiting lists for a primary school place.</P>
        <P>Parents want schools in which their children will be safe.  I am particularly mindful of this given that it is the anniversary of the publication of the Ryan report.  Parents also want schools in which the standard of teaching and learning is high.  While I agree with Deputies Brian Hayes and Ruair&iacute; Quinn that patronage is important, many of the parents to whom I speak are not obsessed with the issue.  In recognising the importance of patronage we must, however, continue to focus on the quality of teaching and learning.  Our children are given only one <Col N="816"/>chance and we must ensure that they have an opportunity to avail of a positive learning experience and reach their full potential.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in this important and long overdue debate.  There is no doubt that we live in changing times.  Ireland&rsquo;s demographics have changed dramatically in the past 15 years and we have many new cultures.  The country has modernised and acquired a diverse outlook in a very short period.  It is essential that we accept and reflect this diversity in our schooling and education systems.</P>
        <P>At the same time, it is not necessary to throw out everything that is traditional or has stood the test of time.  Much of our education system is of a high quality, particularly at primary level.  Given that the system is not broken, we must be careful about initiating a process of fixing it.</P>
        <P>What is certain is that we do not have sufficient school places.  This is not a question of diversity but one of practical numbers.  The problem is probably most acute in Dublin.  While I do not wish to be parochial, I will speak from experience.  Deputy Quinn, my constituency colleague, will be familiar with a number of problem areas in Dublin South-East.  The statistics and figures used by the Department to justify its failure to provide an adequate number of school places are either phoney or erroneous.  The Minister, to whom I extend best wishes in her new role, has an opportunity at the beginning of her term of office to address this problem.</P>
        <P>An excellent school under the patronage of the Catholic Church in Donnybrook, my local parish, is turning away 50 or 60 applicants every year.  As the logical outcome of a process, the problem should have been foreseen.  A number of traditional schools in the area, which were under the patronage of various institutions, have closed down and the sites sold to developers.  Mount St. Anne&rsquo;s in Milltown is one such example.  Many of the apartments and units built on these sites were family-sized homes.  It was inevitable, therefore, that the families who moved into them would have children.  They now find that their children have nowhere to go to school such is the extraordinary level of demand for school places in the area.  Parents who put the names of newborn children on waiting lists for primary school places are finding that places are not available in local schools.  This is a major inconvenience.</P>
        <P>The Government must, almost above all else, prioritise the constitutional right to education because educational opportunities for young children are the bedrock of society, the economy and our future.  I ask the Minister to take cognisance of this and ensure she does not deal with the issue lightly.</P>
        <P>Diversity is centred on parental choice.  Deputy Burke spoke eloquently of parents being the primary educators.  Parents have a right to be engaged in this debate, which should take place on a formal basis, and a right to choose the type and ethos of school for their children.  Certain people would love to use the recent horrific scandals in the Catholic Church as a stick with which to beat the church.  Momentum is building to divest the Catholic Church of the patronage of schools around the country.  I have grave reservations about this approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Few of those involved are parents. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I was about to make the same point.  The majority of parents who have children in schools under the patronage of the Catholic Church are happy with these schools and there is considerable demand for places in them.  As I stated, however, many parents find it impossible to secure access to these schools for their children.  It would be a retrograde step to pander to some of the interest groups which appear to be hell bent on removing the Catholic Church from education.  Let us remember the enormous contribution <Col N="817"/>the Catholic Church and other religious institutions have made to educating young people in this country.</P>
        <P>The bottom line is that the quality and standard of a child&rsquo;s education is what matters.  Parents must be allowed to shop around and choose what type of education is best for their child.  That is the right of the parent and is not the role of the State.  Education begins at home.  The role of the State is facilitation for parents in identifying the best possible education opportunities for their children.  There is a risk that the State would assume an interfering role in education.  It is about facilitation, but the primary educators should always be the parents.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that there are possibly too many schools under the patronage of the Catholic Church.  Many people within the institution of the Catholic Church would also agree.  It is necessary to offer more schools, but a diversity of schools of other religious backgrounds and multi-denominational schools.  There is a demand from some parents for multi-denominational schools.  There is a very successful school in my constituency with a waiting list as long as my arm.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 300 on the list.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a huge demand for multi-denominational secondary level schooling as well.  That needs to be a priority, but it does not have to be at the expense of religious education.  Instead, it should complement it by providing the choice that we are all talking about.</P>
        <P>In the provision of a diverse form of education, we do not want to see a land grab by the State.  A national takeover by the State of schools under church patronage is not something parents want.  It would be very damaging to the education system in this country, which has stood us in good stead.  In other jurisdictions with state-run primary and secondary schools, it seems that people try to get out of such systems because the standard is simply too low.  The schools are not competitive and the standard of education suffers.  We only have to look across the water to the UK to see what has happened, where people are getting children baptised and attending mass in a desperate attempt to get their children out of the state schools and into the church patronised schools because the latter are better.  We need to acknowledge the quality we have here and do not throw it away in order to pander to some form of political correctness that does not reflect the wishes of parents or the needs of children.  The quality of state-run schools is very questionable in other jurisdictions and we need to be wary of going down that road.</P>
        <P>This is a very important debate.  We need wide-ranging discussions with all of the stakeholders in education, including parents, the different institutions, teachers and teaching unions.  We have to elevate parents to equal partners in this debate.  Formal consultation is what is needed, or a national convention on education, as has been proposed by our spokesperson on education, Deputy Brian Hayes.  If we go down the role of formalising the role of parents in that dialogue, we can come to a very successful outcome that will serve this country very well into the future.  That is what this is all about.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate on the diversification of primary school provision.  I want to acknowledge the patronage handed down over the years by the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland, and the introduction in recent years of An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta for gaelscoileanna and Educate Together.  I recognise the composition of the boards of all the schools, particularly those handed down over the years, and the people who worked as volunteers and did a wonderful job.  The job was quite easy most of the time until something difficult occurred, such as when the standard of teaching in the school was called into question.  Then the responsibility on the shoulders of <Col N="818"/>those volunteers came to the fore.  They were people of great generosity of spirit and they ensured that the best education was given at the time.</P>
        <P>I largely agree with Deputy Creighton that we should not try to fix what is not broken.  We were extremely fortunate to have the calibre of people who worked on those boards over the years.  I was a member of the board of management of the VEC community colleges in north Tipperary and a member of the board of management of one primary school in Nenagh.</P>
        <P>We must recognise diversity, but in attempting to do so, we must also recognise the importance of faith-based and morality-based education as integral parts of the curriculum.  We know that most parents want to continue with children in a faith-based experience, be it Christian, non-Christian, Islamic or whatever.  People who practise their faiths value them very much, and I believe that this should be part of the school experience for primary school children.</P>
        <P>I also recognise that there are parents who do not want that experience for their children.  They should be facilitated, but there should be room for everybody in the one school for that diversity.  It is an enormous challenge for the Minister to undertake.  In our attempt to address diversity, we should not throw out the faith-based experience that has been very valuable over the years in our schools.  After all, we can develop the physical and mental well being of pupils, but we should not dismiss as trivial the spiritual development of children in our schools, regardless of their religious faith.</P>
        <P>The presence of religious symbols in our schools should remain, whether they be Islamic, Christian or whatever.  There should be a place for the crucifix in our classrooms, or symbols that are important to other faiths, which will truly recognise the diversity of faiths in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have taken account of our community national school model, which has been spearheaded by the VECs.  Let us pay tribute to the VECs across our country.  When success was obvious under gaelscoileanna, the VECs stepped in to provide gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; across the country.  There is a very clear role for the VEC into the future.  I have observed the pilot projects currently under way at County Dublin VEC and these will be followed next September in Kildare and Meath.  The VECs have endeavoured over the years to include an ethos of recognition and respect for all beliefs, both religious and non-religious.  That is a model we should watch closely.  There will be flaws along the way, but the VECs have a proven track record of inclusiveness and this can be developed.</P>
        <P>Patrons have an enormous responsibility, whether it is school ethos, the management of assets and the appointment of staff.  It is important that people from all the representative stakeholders are part of boards of management and that the diversity is reflected in the composition of those boards.</P>
        <P>There should be more debate on this issue.  It is extremely important and will prepare us for the future development of our education system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate and the wider debate on patronage.  As society changes it is important to have this debate and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to having this debate so early.  The 2006 census identified my part of the country as having the fastest growing population under the age of 14.  As a result it might be no surprise that we seem to have spent the past ten years building schools.  We were obviously delighted, as most people would be, with the church&rsquo;s long and fine tradition of service in primary education in all our parishes.  I am a Catholic and when the bishop advised our parish that he would no longer be involved in the patronage of the next school, we wondered where we would go from there.  While that is what today&rsquo;s debate is chiefly about, we should not forget the great role the Catholic Church has played and continues to play in schools in all our parishes.</P><Col N="819"/>
        <P>I want to consider the schools opening in 2010 and raise the issue of the gaelscoileanna.  In the past 20 years Educate Together has established many schools and now has 56 schools with a further two opening in September.  Two schools are open under the new community national school model with three more to open in September.  I am concerned that no gaelscoil has opened in the past three years.  While there are 138 gaelscoileanna in the country, it is an issue we need to address.  I agree with the Department&rsquo;s review of the situation.  Prior to now a school might have been established without necessarily matching the demographic need.  While in my parish a gaelscoil is being established this year, it is being established as a private school because it does not match the demographic need.  I understand the Department&rsquo;s point that the system up to 2008 meant that people could establish a school first and then see the requirement thereafter.  Some new schools in other areas needed to be established at short notice to meet the surge of demand, as we have seen around the Dublin area.  Some schools were being established in areas where the population was not growing or was declining.  I agree with the Minister in those concerns.  While some of those schools were being established in areas of declining population, in the area where I live we just need to establish a school.  The demographic need and having a place in the education system for every child needs to be the first requirement, after which we can enter the minefield of the patronage question.</P>
        <P>I join previous speakers in voicing my support for the VEC model.  The VEC has a proven track record with the new community national school model that has been established.  It recognises the wishes of parents to have their children receive faith-based education as an integral part of the school curriculum.  That is important for me as a parent and is important for many parents whom I represent.  The VEC model is to be encouraged in that it provides that opportunity.  I echo what Deputy Conlon said about the VEC and Educate Together working together.  We need more people talking to each other.  It is the options for children and parents that are important.  It is important that the main faiths in the schools can be accommodated in the teaching of religion during the school day in accordance with the wishes of parents.</P>
        <P>In response to a point made by Deputy Quinn earlier, it depends on the part of the country from which one comes.  I come from a part of the country where the demographics were not easy to predict.  Deputy Quinn said it is easy to predict that five years after a child is born he or she will go to school.  In the year my child was born, 30 children were born in our parish but 120 five year olds started school.  It is not easy to predict.  As we know, most of those people moved out from the Dublin area.</P>

	<P>I make the point that there is an exceptional demographic aspect to it.  While I accept this is a minefield, I am glad we are debating it because we need to address many issues.  We have the demographic need that has led to increased demand in the area in which I live.  There is also the issue of religious provision during the school day.  It is of concern that no gaelscoil has been approved in the past few years.  Did the Department receive applications where the patron was gaelscoil and the demographic need existed?  I would support the reasoning that the demographic need must back it up.  Let us have gaelscoileanna and let us have schools where the demographic requirement exists.</P>

	<P>On 8 April RTE broadcast a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme about the new community primary school model that operates in Dublin.  It featured footage from Scoil<?oasys _jy ?>Choilm community national school in Porterstown.  After it was broadcast a number of com<Col N="820"/>plaints about the programme were made to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  I watched the programme.  It had footage of the pupils and teachers in the school.  Various people were interviewed followed by a panel discussion involving Paul Rowe, the chief executive of Educate Together, and a representative of the Catholic Church.  Without knowing more detail of the programme, from the outset I felt it was very unfair and unbalanced.  The manner in which it used footage of the children in their classes in the school was unethical.  It showed footage depicting the segregation of students within a class, which was staged.  RTE insisted that the teachers did that for the purposes of the camera that was filming in the class, which was disgraceful.  One parent was featured in that footage.  That person was not a parent of one of the children in the school but was a parent who had nothing to do with the school who was campaigning for an Educate Together school in the area.  The background of some of the people featured in the programme was revealed but the background of some of the other people who were critical of the school model was not revealed in the programme or in the panel discussion afterwards.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Although the programme was about the VEC model of national school and about a particular school, the VEC was not invited to take part in the panel discussion afterwards.  Instead it had a representative of an educational body that is campaigning for a particular model of school and in reality is in competition with the VEC for school patronage.  That is fair enough given that education is about choice and so on.  A representative of the Catholic Church was also on the panel.  Those were two people not directly connected with the school, resulting in a very unbalanced discussion among the panel afterwards.  That was not the fault of the members of the panel but the fault of the makers of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme.</P>
        <P>RTE needs to review how it carries out some of those &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programmes.  The programme used footage of primary schoolchildren in a programme that denigrated the school they attended.  The parents and the teachers in the school were very angry and upset about the programme.</P>
      
        <P>Subsequently, the parents were reported in the local media as being happy with the school.  Those parents, teachers and children have invested time and interest in that school which is a pilot school.  Just as Educate Together and the Catholics schools have had to change their model as they went along and learned how certain aspects did not work and to try something new, I presume it will be same for this school model.  Those parents are working for that school and the way RTE made the programme was a disgrace.</P>
        <P>One of the local media outlets, <i>Community Voice</i>, interviewed the principal and some of the parents from the school.  The principal, Teresa Lowe, said she did not think the programme was fair or equitable in its depiction of the school.  She felt RTE had a particular agenda in making the programme and that the presenter, Emma O&rsquo;Kelly, portrayed the situation from her own perspective to underpin that agenda.  Mr. Michael Guilfoyle, a parent with a daughter in the school, told <i>Community Voice</i> that the programme implied there was segregation in the school and division between the children based on their religious beliefs.  This is the complete opposite of what the school stands for.  The principal pointed out that although she was interviewed for half an hour, none of that interview was used in the programme.  The only local parent interviewed has no children in the school and had been involved in an unsuccessful attempt to set up an Educate Together school in the area some years ago.</P>
        <P>It is on record that Emma O&rsquo;Kelly specifically asked the teachers to set up the separation of the children for her to film and, according to the principal, &ldquo;then presented it as if it were a regular event and as an example of segregation and division in the school&rdquo;.  The whole thing was stage-managed to present a very wrong impression of the school.</P><Col N="821"/>
        <P>Another parent stated that this school helps children understand other religions and beliefs which means they can bring this understanding into the wider world.  That needs to be noted because I do not know if there will be any further coverage regarding that programme or what will happen as a result of complaints made to the broadcasting authority.  Many people would have watched that programme and taken it to be fact.  I took a look at it and could see it was unbalanced but some people have expressed comments to me that indicate they took the programme to be factual and a fair presentation of the situation.  It was not.  RTE must look at that issue again.</P>
        <P>To return to the general debate we must ask what is important to people.  I am a politician, who, before I had a child in school, dealt with many parents who were trying to get their children into school in the Lucan area.  If we were to do a survey on this, the most important point for people would be to have local schools.  They campaign to have access to a local school and to have a school place.  They want a good school.  People are moving towards a preference for co-education and there is also a growing demand for multi-denomational schools.  Parents want their schools to be inclusive and their children to be educated to be good people.  That is the ethos concerning which most people would have common ground &mdash; a good education.  I agree with this.  In practice, and from my experience, many if not most Catholic schools are, in effect, multi-cultural and many are even multi-denominational.  They are good schools; the parents work hard for them and, in most cases, the teachers provide a good education.  Obviously, there are particular examples that can be used to oppose this but it is my experience and I believe it to be the reality.  Catholic schools have contributed a great deal to our educational system and we must acknowledge that.  That is not to say there are not issues that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>In terms of how we move forward, the Labour Party&rsquo;s idea of a forum on patronage is the way.  One cannot simply say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.  Let&rsquo;s get rid of the church out of education&rdquo;.  That would be wrong.  That is not the way to deal with issues.  One brings on board and involves the stakeholders.  A forum on patronage would be a way to do that, involving the Catholic Church, which has so much to provide in terms of experience and the work it does, and, similarly, the Church of Ireland schools and people from different faiths and of none, agnostics or atheists.  Everybody has a contribution to make to this debate and we all have common ground.  Ultimately, we all want our children to be educated well and to turn out as kind good people.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to pre-empt any discussion that will take place but I am in favour of a State model of national education.  People talk as if we have never dealt with these issues before but at second level the vocational educational committee has been putting forward multi-denomational and co-educational education for years and has been really successful in bringing on board the different faiths.  In my area there are the Church of Ireland and the Catholic Church, and now there are Muslims and other faiths.  The VEC has brought in those involved and has developed community schools and community college models where one might be the child of a doctor or a plumber, or someone who otherwise might drop out of school early.  The VEC tries to cater for all those people and has been a successful model.  It produced our recent Oscar winner who came from Ballyfermot College of Further Education.  It is possible to do this because it has been done at second level.  We should try to do something similar at primary level.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; ar an &aacute;bhar r&iacute;-th&aacute;bhachtach seo.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag roinnt mo chuid ama leis an Teachta Mattie McGrath.</P><Col N="822"/>
        <P>Any discussion on diversification of primary education provision must begin with an acknowledgment of the tremendous contribution made to date by denominational schools.  Clearly, it is impossible to quantify the entirety of the contribution made by these schools or by the church men and women and religious members who devoted their entire lives to educating generations of Irish people.  We now know that a small cohort of these people betrayed public trust by committing unspeakable crimes, a fact which today, unfortunately, distorts current public opinion on the enormously valuable work done by religious communities at a time when the State had neither the capacity nor the resources to meet the educational needs of its people.</P>
        <P>In the boards of management, staff groupings and parents&rsquo; associations within the Church of Ireland community and Roman Catholic schools throughout the length and breadth of Ireland there is a corpus of knowledge and experience which is invaluable to the educational welfare of our children.  However traumatised we may be by recent revelations, we must be proportionate in our assessment and ensure that the best interest of all our children is served.</P>
        <P>Over the past decade, growing secularism, a changing socio-economic demographic and far greater urbanisation, together with a reawakening of interest in Irish culture and the Irish language, have brought the rapid emergence of two new strong and effective players in primary education provision.  The growth in the number and spread of Educate Together schools and gaelscoileanna has been significant.  Educate Together and An Foras Patr&uacute;ntachta have demonstrated an impressive commitment and ability to manage schools and respond to an ever-growing public demand.  Although the cynics in Irish society may raise questions about the extent to which these schools have achieved high levels of social integration, that contention would be hotly contested by the patrons of these schools.</P>
        <P>It is important to limit the number of patron bodies approved as providers at both primary and secondary level while at the same time recognising the need to provide as much parental choice as is practicable and equitable in the best interests of all of our children.  To that end, the work being done by Educate Together and An Foras Patr&uacute;ntachta should continue to be supported and promoted.  We also must recognise the strong commitment of the Church of Ireland community in maintaining its small network of excellent schools across the country.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding everything that has happened, we need to recognise that a substantial number of Irish parents continue to seek a Catholic education for their children and while acknowledging that the Roman Catholic Church may no longer have the capacity to deliver this service in as many locations as previously &mdash; this challenge will grow if vocations continue to decline &mdash; we must have regard to the manner in which Catholic provision has developed in other countries such as the United States and Britain.  Put simply, we must ensure that in any new dispensation we create, Catholic education does not become the exclusive preserve of a few.</P>
        <P>I am convinced that integration and equality must be the cornerstones of any new system of education provision.  Schools for the most part operate at the heart of local communities.  It is vital we have full consultation at local level between all the partners in education.</P>
        <P>I salute the VEC sector, which since the 1930s has shown itself to be a system that is flexible, innovative, caring and inclusive.  At a time when we talk much about the need for public service reform, it is appropriate to say that the VEC sector is an example of public service success.  It will show through the community national school programme that it has the capacity to successfully expand its operations into the primary sector to the advantage of its student cohort.</P>
        <P>Having had 25 years experience in the area of education at post-primary and primary level, I can attest to the fact that the VEC model is admirably open and accountable and has the benefit of also being a democratic forum.  I acknowledge the need to rationalise the sector, <Col N="823"/>most notably in the reduction of the overall numbers of VECs, but I suggest to the House it can become a major player in primary school provision.  It would be my personal wish to see VECs developed into local education authorities that could administer and co-ordinate all State education provision, including preschool education, while simultaneously recognising and supporting the existence and ethos of the current primary providers.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be able to make a brief contribution to today&rsquo;s debate.  As a parent, like other speakers, I know that what most parents and families want is a proper grounding and education for children who attend all kinds of national schools.  The VECs have a proven track record over the past 80 years in meeting the responsibilities and needs of colleges.  A model has been set out that can only enhance the national school sector.</P>
        <P>There are a few bad apples in every bunch and some have brought the name and reputation of the Catholic faith into disrepute.  I pay tribute to the vast majority of Catholic brothers and sisters who made a significant contribution to the education of our children over generations from the last century onwards.  As others have said, when the State was unable to provide this education, such people were the champions of the poor and all disciplines in life.  They provided significant service to the State which cannot be wiped away because of the actions of the few.</P>
        <P>I have personal experience of the issue as a parent and as a member of a board of management of a national school and VEC community college.  I know the roles of the volunteers, along with their teaching colleagues and other school staff, clergy and patrons.  Much work is done on a voluntary basis.  Their contribution cannot be overstated as it was fair and without bias.  With the significant changes in recent decades, particularly the last decade, in health and safety, welfare and education Acts, there has been much pressure on those volunteers to maintain and run the schools, often with little training.  They gave their time to the community.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that but I acknowledge that these people have given their time for this cause.  Admissions were allowed from all walks of life, and the policies were inclusive, clear and unambiguous.  It allowed access from all the local communities, without being selective.  That model should be drawn upon and introduced to new areas.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to what the VECs have done over the years at secondary level and in adult and continuing education, which was a poor relation.  The VEC took up the reins in that area when <Col N="824"/>it was not fashionable but the need was greatest.  There are many programmes and nothing has been more satisfying to me as being involved in adult education and seeing opportunities for people to continue their education and lifelong learning.  I salute the VECs across the board in that respect.</P>

	<P>The Deputy has not had a good look at the back.  This has been one of the most uplifting debates I have heard in this House for a long time, and it has taken in the whole educational spectrum.  Some of the famous opinion formers who take centre stage in our national media may be disappointed after today&rsquo;s debate.  Their views have not been echoed to any great degree because we all come from very diverse backgrounds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I come from a very traditional background.  I am happy to say that the people I represent have no trouble seeing how important it is that everybody&rsquo;s views are looked after.  I have only a couple of minutes at my disposal for something I would like to spend an hour on.</P>
        <P>I have had children and grandchildren going through the educational system.  The central issue is that they be educated in a natural and trustworthy environment.  Deputy Quinn mentioned the local aspect, which is very important.  Ultimately, the issue must be parent-based.  Deputy Brian Hayes goes to much trouble in this respect.  There should be a some kind of audit or survey of the parents in Ireland before any change is made and I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will take this on board to some degree when the stakeholders are brought together.  Some people may be surprised at the information coming from such a survey, although I would not.  It would be a mirror image of the debate I have heard today involving people from all parties and none.</P>
        <P>Some people think the correct action is to immediately eliminate the Catholic Church from the system but nothing could be further from the truth.  There is room for new people, along with their views and aspirations, etc.  We must embrace this and there is no great trouble in doing so.  The VECs have proved such an approach over the years at second level.  I am amazed at what the VECs have done, with it going unheralded much of the time.  They deal with many people who would have a very poor chance in life had they not got a start in education.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, I have no idea how the process will pan out.  When Archbishop Diarmuid Martin indicated the church was prepared to hand over schools, I know exactly what he was talking about; it must be done in certain areas.  Nobody is talking about getting rid of what has been an outstanding input to this day, taking in the years since the Famine, the hungry 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.  To take the Catholic Church from the boards of management would necessitate much time and billions of euro to replace it.</P>
        <P>This debate is very important.  I hope we will have a system in which parents will be satisfied that, when their children are not in the living room, they will be in a place as near to it as possible, namely, school, that they are being taught by people who parents can trust and that <Col N="825"/>the values being taught are sufficiently sound to allow their children to develop into people who can make their own way in life irrespective of their parents&rsquo; income levels.  The important element of the story is that we should give everyone as great a chance as we can, which is not too far from the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s motto.</P>
        <P>We look forward with great interest to seeing how this matter develops.  I suppose that, when parents get a real say in what they want their children to do, there will be some changes in many places, but people in most of the country will not want significant changes as long as the standard of education is at the expected level.  It is all about standards and input from the stakeholders.</P>

	<P>The discussion that will take place will present further opportunities.</P>
        <P>I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Quinn to the effect that we must not take our eye off the day job.  Everyone in the House agrees that the quality of education, a focus on children and a role for parental choice constitute the main focus of what we want to ensure.  For many, the struggle to find a child a place conjures up a great deal.</P>
        <P>It is important that I take this opportunity to make some remarks.  The voluntary nature of many people&rsquo;s involvement in education is often forgotten.  Without this voluntary element, the system would not work as well as it does.  It also means that local schools have a community feel.</P>
        <P>I raised this debate on the basis that some colleagues might believe I do not have an open mind, given where I come from.  However, I do.  I am a parent and am very much of the opinion that all children should have the capacity to attend local schools within their communities if possible.  As the mother of a child with a disability, he does not need to come to Dublin to school now that we have moved so much.  This means he has developed well and, since there is no difference, the children in his school do not pass any remarks about him.  It is important that we not differentiate between children on the basis of where they come from.  This will help us to create good citizens.</P>
        <P>In the context of providing parental choice and ensuring quality of education, the needs of rapidly growing areas must be met and children must have places provided for them.  Deputies Ruair&iacute; Quinn and Brian Hayes come from two different perspectives in a large city.  A third of the former&rsquo;s population are not of the Catholic faith and, when I travelled with Deputy Brian Hayes recently, we saw the high levels of deprivation and many other needs that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>We have witnessed a number of aspects in the development of education.  The role of the religious has been and will continue to be important.  The diversification within the religious is equally important.</P>
        <P>I had an opportunity to attend the opening of an Educate Together school.  The children were fabulous and wonderful, the school was beautiful and there was a great sense of community and a large degree of parental involvement.</P>

        <P Just="Left">&Eacute; sin r&aacute;ite, were I to pick the similarities between Deputies, it would be our almost unanimous acceptance of the role of the VECs.  We have all worked with VECs and seen where, through their flexibility, they have met the needs of communities and parents.  Elected representatives sit on VECs, their meetings are open to the public and they are accountable.  They can grow and develop.  For example, parents were not elected during my time, but they can bring much to a VEC, as can the voice of students.  This would be difficult in respect of small children, but not so where secondary level children are concerned.  In second level, t&aacute; guth an aosa &oacute;ig th&aacute;bhachtach.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Joanna Tuffy regarding the new pilot.  Unfortunately, the public was not given an opportunity to be educated on what the pilot was about.  We were not there to differentiate.  I note the concerns of Deputies Tuffy and Quinn about the differentiation among the children and the possibility that someone might feel left out.  I have not had an opportunity to visit one of these schools yet, but I hope to do so.  I have been given initial information on how the system is working and its practicalities.  We should learn from the process and ensure that our final decisions, as supported by legislation, will be the right ones.</P>

        <P>Much of what has been stated in the House has been informed, informative, balanced and sincere.  The real message I have garnered from the debate is that the patrons provide education in the best interests of children.  As the Minister for Education and Skills, my role is to ensure this situation continues and I look forward to determining how to advance the matter.  I listened to the Deputies&rsquo; opinions on how that should happen, but there is a widespread acceptance that the Lower and Upper Houses hold the role of the education of young people in the creation of citizens dearly.  I hope that we will have further opportunities to discuss what the future should be.  I will not approach it with a definitive decision, as it is an opportunity for Deputies to express their views.  As former Ministers, some Deputies would know that lobbyists and representatives and not Members of the House get the first opportunity to say something.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Eradicating global hunger is a foreign policy priority for both the Irish and US governments.  It is appropriate that we collaborate and bring our combined expertise to bear in working towards our shared objective.  In Ireland, arising from the hunger task force report, we have made the eradication of hunger a cornerstone of our aid programme.  We recognise that feeding a global <Col N="828"/>population, expected to surpass 9 billion by 2050, in a world where climate change is having a dramatic impact on our capacity to produce food, will be one of the biggest global challenges of this century.  For the first time ever, more than 1 billion people, which is one sixth of all humanity, are now hungry.  This is unacceptable and Ireland and the US agree that concerted action is essential to eliminate global hunger.  The Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and I have had many discussions with our US counterparts on how we can co-operate optimally to ensure that food, the most basic of all human needs, is available and easily accessed by all.  Most recently, last month in Washington, I met with Secretary of State Clinton&rsquo;s chief of staff to discuss the issue.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>Next September, Ireland and the United States will co-host a major event on hunger and under-nutrition at the UN Summit on the Millennium Development Goals.  This event will bring together world leaders to highlight the importance of agriculture in reducing hunger, and improving nutrition in the households of the world&rsquo;s poorest and most vulnerable.  Our objective is to focus political attention and galvanize action around realising MDG 1, which is to halve the numbers living in hunger and poverty by 2015.</P>
        <P>We are co-operating with the United States across the food security agenda.  We recently signed a three-year partnership with the United States to co-operate on combating hunger in Malawi, prioritising support to small-holder farmers, efforts to increase soil fertility and measures to adapt to climate change.  Malawi is an excellent example of a country where enlightened national policies have dramatically reduced hunger levels.</P>
        <P>In addition, Ireland and the United States have indicated a readiness to collaborate in other sub-Saharan states on practical country-owned and country-led hunger reduction programmes.  Both countries agree that without a more effective agriculture sector and stronger governance mechanisms, many developing countries will struggle to increase agricultural production to feed their rapidly growing populations.</P>
     
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">Intensifying small-holder agricultural production in order to improve nutritional status is key to improving the livelihoods of the hungry and poor in marginalised areas, and is an important component of sustainable and equitable economic development.</P>
        <P>Ireland and the US will co-operate further in addressing food insecurity and promoting agricultural development under the new EU-US road-map for co-operation.  Joint action has been agreed on country-led food security plans, in the implementation of regional agricultural programmes and, at global level, in regard to the implementation of the reforms of the Committee on World Food Security and of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research.</P>
        <P>Both countries have prioritised the strengthening of country-led initiatives to address food insecurity and we are active supporters of the comprehensive Africa agriculture development programme, an African-owned and African-led initiative working to achieve better economic growth through agricultural-led development.  These practical examples of excellent co-ordination and co-operation between Ireland and the US in tackling global hunger and food insecurity demonstrate an effective working relationship between our two countries.</P>
        <P>Together, Ireland and the US are strong advocates on food security and a powerful voice for the poor.  Both governments are working together in the food and nutrition security areas, and are undertaking strong and co-ordinated leadership action to shape and influence the international response to the scandal of world hunger.</P>
 </Speaker><Col N="829"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled this question because last Thursday I, along with Deputies Higgins and Timmins, met with the US ambassador and his officials.  At that meeting we discussed food security, the co-ordination between Ireland and the US, and the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs in this regard.  We had a lengthy discussion on the benefits of possibly co-ordinating our efforts.  The Minister of State has answered the question, specifically on the three-year partnership in Malawi.  As he said, there is a readiness to collaborate on other issues in sub-Saharan Africa.  Can the Minister of State indicate the benefits that would arise from such collaboration?  I presume that we will take on any productive collaboration with the US if it means getting better value for Irish Aid&rsquo;s expenditure.  Will the Minister of State tell us specifically about the kind of co-ordination and collaboration he is talking about?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am excited about the developing relationship on this issue between the United States and Ireland, which involves the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.   Both countries are very complementary in this area.  The United States is a major donor, while Ireland is a relatively small one, although we have a history of hunger lack of food security through the Great Famine.  This is a great opportunity to link a relatively small programme with a huge programme to achieve real results on the ground.  We have two winning partners with real synergies involved.  It complements the hunger task force&rsquo;s recommendation to advocate internationally and bring on board global donors, thus bringing their efforts to bear on the food security and hunger initiatives.  By collaborating with the US and bringing it on board with the hunger agenda, it means that those who need and deserve that help, in sub-Saharan Africa especially, will get it from a major donor.  </P>
        <P>In Malawi, we will be battling climate change in so far as it affects agricultural production, with a special focus on water irrigation projects.  Those matters are very important for small-holder farmers in Malawi.  The US already has a great partnership with Malawi.  In combining our efforts in such projects, we are giving action to tackle hunger the absolute priority it deserves.  In addition, we are demonstrating to the international community that because big donors and global leaders such as the US, with all the influence they can bring to bear on the world stage, are taking hunger and food security seriously, others should do so as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>USAID&rsquo;s mission statement is similar to that of the hunger task force, as are recent comments by President Obama and the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.  Apart from the three-year partnership for Malawi, it is a significant step for the Irish Aid programme and our overall overseas aid budget that we are seeking to co-ordinate our efforts with USAID on food security issues.   As I understand it, the US aid body is the largest food donor in the world, contributing almost half the global figure in dollars.  Is it the case that Ireland is now beginning to co-ordinate with USAID in our programme countries throughout Africa?   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.  USAID now has a real focus on food security and hunger.  By holding this political event on the margins of the Millennium Development Review conference in September, and inviting all the major players &mdash; including countries, multilateral organisations the largest NGOs &mdash; we will be telling the UN that hunger and food security must be at the top of the conference agenda.  It will allow a small country such as ours, with a real focus and interest in this area, to use or international reputation to ensure that other countries come on board also.  That is where the collaboration and synergies will really bear fruit for people on the ground.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
        <P>On 15 February 2010, the Dubai chief of police confirmed that several suspects, believed to have been involved with the killing of Hamas chief, Mahmoud al Mabhouh, in January, had entered Dubai on the passports of a number of foreign countries.  Twenty-six suspects were named, of whom three had travelled on Australian passports, four on French passports, 12 using British passports, one on a German passport and six on Irish passports.  Following further discussions between our ambassador in Abu Dhabi and the Dubai police during which additional information was provided, the passport service was able to confirm that the Irish passports used were counterfeit.  Subsequent investigations by the Dubai police exposed more fraudulent passports, two of which were Irish, bringing the total number of Irish passports used to eight.</P>
        <P>Unlike the position for many of the countries whose passports were used, the fake Irish passports did not involve the stolen identities of actual Irish citizens.  Instead, passport numbers were used in respect of six of these passports while the remaining two passports were never issued by the Irish passport service.  Officials of my Department contacted the six Irish citizens and, in the case of two minors, their families, whose passport numbers were stolen.  Replacement passports have issued to each citizen concerned.</P>
        <P>When I became aware of the suggestion that Irish passports may have been used by persons involved in the Dubai killing, I initiated an investigation by the passport service.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also undertaking its own investigation.  Since the investigations commenced, officials of my Department have been in regular and ongoing contact with the Dubai authorities through the Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi.  The Dubai police have provided further information as it has emerged locally over the past three months.  This information has been used by the passport service and passed on to the Garda.</P>
        <P>I have just received the report of the passport service and am considering its findings.  I intend to share those findings with my Government colleagues.  Officials of the passport service continue to provide assistance to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the completion of its investigation.  On that basis, I expect to be in a position to make a statement on the matter within the next couple of weeks.</P>
        <P>I emphasise once again the seriousness with which the Government regards any attempt to forge Irish passports, even more so to use such documents as cover for criminal activity.  The Irish passport is widely regarded and respected throughout the world as being of the highest quality.  Ireland has invested heavily in additional security features in order that its citizens can travel in safety.  Actions which endanger Ireland&rsquo;s well-earned reputation in this area have the potential to affect the security of all citizens travelling overseas.  The Government is determined to maintain the good name of Irish passports.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="831"/>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Can he confirm that he has received a final Garda report on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I have just received the report of the Irish Passport Office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Very well.  Will the Minister consider sharing that report&rsquo;s contents with Members?  Ultimately, the people wish to know who abused and used Irish passports.  In addition, is the aforementioned report conclusive?  Does the passport service report identify clearly who used Irish passports?  The Minister should indicate the current status of the Garda investigation, whether a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na travelled to Dubai to carry out part of the investigation and, if not, the reason.  If Ireland is serious about this investigation, a member of the Garda would have travelled there.  The Minister should also enlighten the House as to the current status of investigations by other countries and whether he has had dealings or bilateral talks with representatives of such countries in respect of information they may have obtained.  If individuals or countries are identified as having been behind this action, what steps does the Government propose to take?  This is a very serious matter.  Much outrage was expressed at that time and I hope it will not be diluted by the passage of time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that this is a serious matter.  I undertake to share the report with the spokespersons present.  While there are aspects to the report that I may not be able to publish as so doing in essence would compromise the security of the passport system itself, aside from that I wish to publish as much of the material as possible.  It depends on one&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo;.  There are conclusions.  Moreover, there have been conclusions to the British Serious Organised Crime Agency, SOCA, investigation.  While its conclusions ultimately may not be definitive, I will cite the former British Foreign Secretary, Mr. David Miliband, who stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Given that this was a very sophisticated operation in which high quality forgeries were made, the [British] Government judges it highly likely that the forgeries were made by a State intelligence service.  Taking this together with other inquiries and the link to Israel established by SOCA, we have concluded that there are compelling reasons to believe that Israel was responsible for the misuse of the British passports.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">That was the British conclusion and was the level of conclusion to which they could arrive.  I have been apprised of their report and have seen its essence.  While our report makes conclusions, the Garda conclusion is not complete.  Obviously, I will talk to the Deputies again in this regard.  I hope to make a statement on this matter within the next couple of weeks.  Before I make that statement, I will share its content with the Deputies.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to pursue a further aspect of this matter that may be worthy of further answers from the Minister.  It is the case that the former Foreign Secretary, Mr. David Miliband, has made a clear statement in respect of his estimation of the evidence that was available to the British Government at that time.  There have been significant changes in that a British citizen has been identified by the British Government as a further suspect, that is, as the 19th suspect.  This individual has been identified and has been referred to in recent reports, for example, in <i>The Independent</i> of London, as someone who had a valid British passport.  This suspect is known to the British authorities and is suspected to be in hiding in western Europe.  In the atmosphere in which Britain is pursuing this matter, it requested an official at the Israeli Embassy in London to leave.  That particular official was a liaison officer with MI6.  My point, which is important, is the degree to which the operation of so-called <Col N="832"/>intelligence services undermines the diplomatic relations between countries and undermines foreign policy principles.  The point I put to the Minister is that our position differs from that of the British but at the same time, if in fact the Minister reaches a conclusion, such a conclusion could be frustrated by the simple assertion that the actions of an intelligence service operating in the grey areas beyond diplomacy cannot be confirmed or denied.  Is it not the case that the Minister has been told by the Israeli ambassador that he cannot prove anything and that, effectively, as far as the ambassador is concerned, he simply is going to stonewall on the basis that he knows nothing and will not say anything until things are proved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The presentation by the Deputy is a fair one in some respects.  There is a difference between the British position and that of Ireland along the lines outlined by the Deputy.  That said, in assessing both the information we have received from other countries that have been involved by the fraudulent use of or forgeries of their passports and our own assessment, there comes a time when one must make a call.  Consequently, we will do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>May I intervene again briefly?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>While I will allow both Deputies back in, I will allow Deputy Higgins to go first unless Deputy Timmins minds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  The Minister will note that my question referred to Irish passports and to EU citizens&rsquo; identities.  My point pertains to the evolution of the diplomatic personality of the European Union with particular reference to the evolution of Baroness Ashton&rsquo;s new diplomatic service.  It is of absolutely crucial significance that intelligence agencies not be allowed to cross over in such a way as to endanger the development of relations between the European Union and the rest of the world.  That was part of my distinction between the Irish position and that of the British.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy; if that was to happen, it would be an issue of the gravest concern.  We must be vigilant to make sure the European Union External Action Service is in no way undermined by the activities of intelligence agencies or the crisscrossing or duplication.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  the number of persons <Col N="833"/>working in the passport offices in Dublin and Cork; the current number of applications that are backlogged; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[20888/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are currently 248 staff working in the passport offices in Dublin and Balbriggan and a further 72 in Cork.  At 17 May 2010, there were 62,008 applications in the system. </P>
        <P>The Department has obtained the necessary sanction to recruit 50 temporary staff and arrangements have been made for staff to commence work at short notice.  If necessary, we are prepared to recruit additional staff.</P>
        <P>These arrears are a direct result of the ongoing industrial action by the Civil Public and Services Union.  It is currently taking up to 25 working days to process individual applications submitted through the passport express service, the Northern Ireland passport express service and at the counters in the Passport Office.  Applications submitted through ordinary post are taking up to eight weeks to process.  Applications, other than those that are prioritised on the basis of demonstrable urgent humanitarian need, are being processed on a first come, first served basis.</P>
        <P>The dispute is having a severe impact on the travelling public.  There are many Irish citizens whose trips abroad have had to be cancelled and holiday and work plans severely disrupted.</P>
        <P>Every effort is being made to reduce the waiting time for applications, pending the resolution of the industrial action.  Staff have been working overtime for some weeks and this has kept the level of increase in the backlog to a minimum and in recent days seen a marginal reduction in the backlog.</P>
        <P>However, the backlog in passport applications can and will be overcome when the CPSU calls off its industrial action and co-operates with the recruitment of temporary staff normally engaged at this time of year.  I would once again call on the CPSU to withdraw this restriction and to allow a significant number of currently unemployed workers to take on paid employment and assist in reducing the sizeable backlog of passport applications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that we acknowledge that the staff at the Passport Office were one of the great examples of good public service in recent years and that it has been brought into disrepute by this go-slow.  I join the Minister in requesting that the CPSU permits the temporary workers who are currently unemployed to be taken on.  It would assist greatly in dealing with the backlog.  A great inconvenience is being caused to many people because they cannot get their passports.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister clarify how many machines are in operation?  Where are they?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>

	<P>There is a point to make, apart from the industrial action, in terms of contingencies, such as the building being flooded.  There is a case for the north west to have a machine, and the south.  Those are the two priority areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>

	<P>The north west is an idea because there have been so many applications from the North.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fair point and we want to establish a passport office in that area.</P>
        <P>I have previously raised the idea of establishing an information office at the airport for people who run into difficulties with their passports.  Perhaps one of the airlines would take this up as an extra duty.  There is hardly a day goes by but someone runs into difficulty at the airport.  If it could fall within the remit of the airport authority as part of its information service to link up with the Department of Foreign Affairs to advise people on what they can do if they discover a problem with their passport at the airport.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  the position regarding Turkey&rsquo;s accession to the European Union; his views on Turkey&rsquo;s accession; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[21235/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Union has a long and close relationship with Turkey.  Accession negotiations were opened in 2005 and Ireland makes a constructive input to those negotiations. </P>
        <P>As a beneficiary of a past enlargement, and on the experience of more recent accessions, Ireland is generally supportive of enlargement.  The prospect of enlargement bolsters economic and political reform processes and helps to promote stability, security and prosperity in Europe.  The process includes rigorous conditionality and takes into account the capacity of the EU to integrate new members.  Enlargement has to be negotiated and, as in any negotiation, the eventual outcome and timeframe cannot be predicted.</P>
        <P>These factors shape Ireland&rsquo;s supportive approach to Turkey&rsquo;s candidacy.  There are, in addition, potential gains to the Single Market and to trade through the accession of a country of Turkey&rsquo;s size.  The Union&rsquo;s reach and influence in the Middle East and Central Asia could be enhanced through Turkish accession.</P><Col N="835"/>
        <P>Turkey still has substantial work ahead in meeting the established criteria and conditions for membership.  Progress in the negotiations was reviewed by EU Ministers in the Council last December.  At a meeting with the Turkish Minister for EU Affairs last week in Brussels, the Spanish Presidency and the Commission highlighted a number of areas where measures were still required.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>At bilateral level, I met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in Dublin on 10 March 2010.  In the course of that meeting, Minister Davutoglu outlined the progress Turkey has made on reforms in a number of areas as it has sought to bring Turkey more in line with the EU <i>acquis</i>.  He explained how the accession negotiations provide a strong incentive for Turkey to pursue reforms, strengthen democracy and human rights and further modernise the country.  While much has been achieved in Turkey in these areas, the challenge is now for Turkey to maintain and accelerate the progress on reforms.</P>
        <P>I reiterated to Minister Davutoglu Ireland&rsquo;s support for the Turkish candidacy.  At the same time, I noted the Council&rsquo;s deep regret at Turkey&rsquo;s continued non-compliance with its obligations under the Ankara Protocol and I highlighted the need for Turkey to make progress towards normalisation of its relations with the Republic of Cyprus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of resolutions were issued by the European Parliament, one as recently as March 2009, that noted the concern of &ldquo;the continuous slow down of the reform process and called on Turkey to prove its political will to continue the reform process&rdquo;.  It particularly stressed the need to reach a solution regarding Cyprus.</P>
      
        <P>There is a legitimate concern about the fact that Turkey as an accession country does not technically recognise the Republic of Cyprus, which is a member state of the European Union.  Repeatedly, the European Council, the European Commission and in particular the European Parliament have expressed serious concern about this.  There appears to be a deadlock and a significant lack of progress on this issue.  Will the Minister provide the House with a more comprehensive view of the Government&rsquo;s position on Cyprus?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have continually articulated the need to resolve the issue with regard to the Republic of Cyprus.  The background is that at the Helsinki European council in 1999, Turkey became a candidate and negotiations opened in 2005.  I am aware that in a motion at its Ard-Fheis in 2004, Fine Gael endorsed and supported the candidacy of Turkey for the European Union and I understand that remains the position of the main political parties in this House, in government and opposition.</P>
        <P>There are many challenges in the negotiating process, some of the key ones being the Cyprus question and non-compliance with the Ankara protocols.  There have been reforms in matters pertaining to the judiciary, human rights and other issues and generally speaking it is fair to state there has been progress on those issues.  However, there has not been progress on the obligations Turkey has under the Ankara process; it continues to refuse to open its ports and airports to vessels and aircraft from the Republic of Cyprus.  In 2006, the European Council decided that eight chapters of the accession framework could not be opened and that there would be no further chapters until Turkey fulfils it commitment in this regard, and those measures remain in place.  There is a deadlock.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>The position of the French and German Governments have in some ways changed and it is fair to state that the political and economical climates have dramatically altered in the past two years.  The French Minister of State for European affairs recently stated that alternatives should be considered with regard to Turkish accession, and the CSU, which is part of the governing coalition in Germany, stated it would rather see a privi<Col N="836"/>leged partnership than full membership of the European Union.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on this?  Does it alter the playing pitch in any significant way?  The French Minister of State also made the point that if Turkey meets the criteria, the question of absorption into the European Union of its 72 million population would be a consideration, which is a new standard for accession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>From time to time since the Helsinki Council, various politicians throughout Europe have articulated different positions on this.  It has been a lengthy process.  We have to be careful and sensitive in how we approach this challenging issue.  As a small open economy, we depend very much on liberalisation of world trade.  We need to export our goods and services to create jobs here.  The European Union began with six member states and now has 27 member states with a population of 500 million people.  We export to many of those countries and our exports grow.  Our combined trade on goods with Turkey is at &euro;800 million and in services it is at &euro;466 million.  The Turkish economy is growing at approximately 10% per annum, notwithstanding the current global crisis, and it has a population of 72 million.  I accept its GDP is way below that of Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 35%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but not necessarily as low as that of Bulgaria or Rumania, relative to Ireland.</P>
        <P>We need to be flexible in how we approach these issues.  The issue of absorption is one that must be resolved and a study must be undertaken by the European Union on its capacity to absorb.  This must be done prior to any accession.  Politically, it is acceptable for people to make the odd statement to grab headlines but we cannot be seen as a country that is closing doors all over the place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>We also have to critically assess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have to be realistic and look at things.  There have been derogations.  We chose not to accept derogations from the ten candidate countries in 2004 but we put derogations in place with regard to Bulgaria and Romania.  We need to consider issues such as these in terms of new accessions.</P>

	<P>The establishment of the North-South consultative forum, provided for in the Good Friday Agreement, has been discussed with the Northern Ireland Executive at all the plenary meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council since the re-establishment of the Executive in May 2007.  At those meetings, the Government delegation is led by the Taoiseach, while the Northern Ireland Executive delegation is led by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.</P><Col N="837"/>
        <P Just="Left">The plenary meeting in July 2007 noted the intention of the Northern Ireland Executive first to complete its review of the Northern Ireland civic forum, a body provided for in the Good Friday Agreement for consulting civic society in Northern Ireland.  That review is still outstanding.</P>
        <P>During 2008, the Government consulted with the social partners and various cross-Border and North-South groups on the establishment of the consultative forum.  Following on from this we formally communicated our proposals to the Northern Ireland Executive on the role, format, membership and operation of the forum.</P>
        <P>On 15 October 2009, as a contribution to the process leading to the establishment of the forum, the Government facilitated a consultative conference in Farmleigh involving the social partners and other civil society groups from across the island.  The conference was opened by the Taoiseach.  Participants from across the island came from all traditions, including representatives from business, the trade union movement, agriculture and the community and voluntary sector.  There was a wide-ranging discussion on the role of civil society and its capacity to contribute meaningfully to cross-Border co-operation.  There was strong support for further such engagement to explore specific areas for co-operation, North and South, at the level of civil society.</P>
        <P>A further North-South consultative conference will take place in Dublin on 26 May.  As on the occasion in October last, representatives from civil society from both parts of Ireland will participate.  The key themes of the conference will relate to sport and young people and innovation, examining in particular the important role that innovation can play in economic recovery, North and South.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the formal North-South consultative forum will be further discussed at the next plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, scheduled for 5 July 2010.  We will press strongly to have the matter brought to an early conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned that whereas the main items in the St. Andrews Agreement have been implemented, with the restoration of the Assembly, the establishment of the Executive and the transfer of policing functions, the agreement dates from 2006 and with regard to the question of the establishment of the forum and the related issue of the establishment of the North-South interparliamentary body, referred to in Parliamentary Question No. 18, the discussions seem to go on and on.  I am very much in favour of both bodies because we have shared problems and I have no doubt there can be shared solutions.  I see great potential for economic co-operation, cross-Border trade and shared responses to social issues and joint efforts to promote tolerance and understanding.</P>

	<P>A question please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there any way of getting greater impetus for the establishment of these bodies?  Let us have these outstanding aspects of the St. Andrews Agreement implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s views.  He is correct to state that these are aspects of the St. Andrews Agreement and the Good Friday Agreement that have not yet been brought to full realisation.  We take the establishment of both fora very seriously.  Since the institutions were restored in 2007, we have urged and will continue to urge the early establishment of the consultative forum following the completion by the Northern Ireland Executive of its review of the Northern Ireland Civic Forum.  The fact that has not been completed has delayed things somewhat.  To cut to the chase, we hope that there may be a new impetus post the Hillsborough agreement and a new dynamic is emerging within the Executive.  There have <Col N="838"/>been moves in terms of the parliamentary forum.  A conference is taking place, which is an important first step in terms of dialogue between both Parliaments.  </P>
        <P>On the forum, we had a very useful meeting at Farmleigh and will have a further meeting next week on 26 May.  It will be co-chaired by representatives of civil society, including Mary Davis of Special Olympics Ireland and David Humphreys, the retired rugby player from Northern Ireland.</P>

	<P>Trevor Ringland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will revert to the Deputy on that.  As the Deputy will appreciate, we cannot unilaterally establish this.  It is not an option which is open to us.  We are in a better space now, post-Hillsborough than prior to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister give a ballpark indication of when he expects to see both of these bodies established?  Will he commit himself to ensure that, as far as possible on this part of the island, a renewed impetus will be put into getting these two bodies under way, comh tapaigh agus is f&eacute;idir linn?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been plenty of impetus on this side.  Let us be fair.  The Farmleigh conference is evidence of a genuine desire to explore the issues.  The conference next week is similar.  One thing one does not do in Northern Ireland is set dates, as I know from the past 18 months.  What tends to happen if one sets a date is that the determination is any time beyond that date.  I have no intention of setting a date.  The momentum is in the right area.  In this jurisdiction we have significant experience of such fora in operation and have fewer issues or concerns about them.  In Northern Ireland, I sometimes pick up that people have different perspectives on that.</P>
        <P>I was in north Belfast last week and visited the Tiger&rsquo;s Bay and New Lodge area, which had considerable challenges throughout the Troubles and latterly.  It is interesting to see how many civic society and community groups are now working together very effectively in the local area and genuinely moving things forward, in terms of community integration.  I am very committed to this and the Deputy should take it that we will work closely with him.</P>

        <Quest>  further to Parliamentary Question No. 130 of 30 March 2010, in which he stated that in the case of the education and social inclusion targets, further work is needed to be done to reach numerical rates and appropriate indicators respectively and the European Council will return to these at its June meeting, if he will make a statement detailing his relevant objectives going into the June meeting including whether he will push for the adoption of a 25% poverty reduction target for each Member State </Quest>
        <QRef>[20981/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the March 2010 European Council meeting agreed on the main elements of the new European strategy for jobs and growth, Europe 2020, including the key targets which will guide its implementation and arrangements for its improved monitoring.  There were five European Union headline targets agreed by the European Council and they cover employment; research and development, including innovation; climate change and energy; education; and social inclusion, in particular poverty.  This choice of targets is consistent with the desire to keep the strategy focused on key areas.  It also brings out the potential for interlinkage, where progress under one target can contribute to reaching another.  We believe that the strategy will provide an essential framework for action by the European <Col N="839"/>Union and its member states to achieve higher levels of sustainable jobs and growth as economic recovery is secured. </P>
        <P>The spring European Council provided for further work in a number of areas.  This includes the development of national targets by each member state in dialogue with the Commission; the identification of bottlenecks constraining growth at national and European Union level; and the development by the Commission of its proposals for action at European Union level, notably through the flagship initiatives.  This work is under way, as is the elaboration of numerical rates and appropriate indicators in the case of the education and social inclusion targets, respectively.</P>
        <P>The Commission and Spanish Presidency have been meeting all member states and Ireland had an initial encounter on 29 April in Brussels.  The purpose of that first, useful meeting was to begin the process of dialogue with the Commission concerning Ireland&rsquo;s national targets, as envisaged under the new strategy and as agreed at the spring European Council.  It was also an opportunity to make an input on the matter of a social inclusion indicator where the Commission has acknowledged that its thinking is now evolving from its original suggestion.  We favour the formulation of an appropriate target based on a poverty indicator which reflects the multidimensional nature of poverty, including material deprivation.  Once agreed, the overall European Union poverty reduction target will be translated into national targets to take account of the differing starting points of member states.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, the Government has adopted poverty targets as part of its national policy against poverty and for social inclusion.  The Irish target is based on a composite poverty measure called consistent poverty.  The measure identifies the percentage of the population which is both below 60% of median income, known as at risk of poverty, and experiencing material deprivation, that is, the enforced lack of two or more basic necessities.  The Government target in the national action plan for social inclusion 2000 to 2016 is to further reduce consistent poverty to between 2% to 4% by 2012 and to eliminate it by 2016.  Significant progress is being achieved in reaching these national targets.</P>
        <P>Other European Union fora with expertise and a track record are now contributing to the work on the development of appropriate indicators for an European Union poverty target.  These include the social protection committee where senior Irish officials from the relevant Government Departments are actively participating in the deliberations.  The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, EPSCO, will consider this issue at its meeting on 7 and 8 June.  The outcome from that discussion is expected to feed into the June European Council meeting.</P>

	<P>Does the Minister agree that poverty is a complex issue which employment by itself will not resolve for everyone?  The assumption that poverty can be addressed ignores the reality of the working poor, those who have disabilities and dependancies and the like.  Does the Minister agree that a specific target is necessary if real progress on poverty reduction is to be made?  Does he agree that under the Lisbon strategy the European Union made a commitment to make a decisive impact on poverty by 2010 and failed to do so?  In 2000, some 16% of the population of the European Union were at risk of poverty and by 2008, some 17% were at risk.  Given the current climate, does the Minister agree that is an underestimation of those who are at risk of poverty?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that we need targets and I support the Europe 2020 strategy, in so far as it is endeavouring to fix targets along the five core areas.  This strategy is better shaped and formulated because it has shortened the number of targets and areas.  It has a much sharper focus that the previous Lisbon strategy.  We welcome the education targets and the <Col N="840"/>idea of targets for social inclusion.  There are issues across member states as to the definition of &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;, from consistent poverty to relative poverty and so forth.  We have had these debates domestically.  </P>
        <P>I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point; it is complex and poverty is not just the absence of a job, although employment is one of the key weapons against poverty, about that there is no question.  It was a factor in the last decade, in terms of Ireland reducing its rate of consistent poverty.  Education and opportunity is very much linked to poverty.  We support a target which sees the rate of early school leavers falling to under 10% by 2020 and at least 40% of the younger generation having a tertiary degree.  Our national target is already in place under the national skills strategy.  We are well placed to meet European Union headline targets in education.</P>
        <P>In regard to the share of early school leavers, Ireland currently stands at 11.3% which represents a strong performance relative to the European Union average of 14.9%.  We will go below that in order to reach the European Union target of not less than 10%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Now that we have the new Department of Social Protection, it is appropriate to make the comparison between the total spend of GDP.  I understand the average in the European Union is approximately 23.5% of GDP; in Ireland it is approximately 18%.  We are well below the average.  During our best times&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Well below which?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I can put it another way.  At a time when we had the highest <i>per capita</i> income, during the highest rates of growth, we were second from bottom in regard to social protection.  However one measures it, our budget expenditure on social protection is significantly less than the European average.</P>
        <P>Taking the European Union anti-poverty network and the text of the treaty, my understanding was that there would be poverty-proofing of other policies, including the five new headlines the Minister mentioned.  Can I take it there will be poverty-proofing across these five new indicators and that a significant attempt will be made to achieve the European average in social protection?</P>
        <P>I refer to the education figures the Minister mentioned.  I am afraid we would not allow them to cloud the fact that we have significant obstacles in our own back to education scheme for the unemployed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of poverty reduction, during the past ten years there has been a very significant reduction in consistent poverty in Ireland and we have used our resources quite effectively to achieve that.  The latest results from the EU survey on income and living conditions released in November 2009, which applied to 2008, indicated at that stage that the reductions in poverty were on track to achieve the 2012 and 2016 targets.  It showed that the rate of consistent poverty in the population in 2008 was 4.2%, down from 5.1% in 2007.  I accept that since 2008, we have experienced the fuller impact of the economic crash which would affect those figures but we made significant progress.</P>
        <P>In terms of education, sometimes we do not acknowledge some of our achievements.  In regard to tertiary education attainment for 30 to 34 year old people, Ireland compares very favourably to other EU member states at 46.1%.  Ireland already exceeds the proposed target of 40%.  The current EU average is 31%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>We have very highly educated unemployed people.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="841"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not be that dismissive.  We all know from research that education during the lifespan of an individual is the key to his or her progression in terms of employment attainment.  Education is the one guarantee of exit from poverty and of a decent quality of life.  It advances a society collectively.</P>
        <P>When I was Minister for Education and Science in 1999, we worked out what percentage of the population we wanted to reach tertiary level.  That was ten years ago.  We set about dramatically increasing the number of places, equipment and teachers at third level.  We must continue to do that to be competitive.  I accept that poverty-proofing is something which will feed into the debate and so on.</P>

        <Quest>  if he will indicate whether Irish observers will be present at the forthcoming Ethiopian elections </Quest>
        <QRef>[20930/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The elections in Ethiopia on 23 May represent an important step in the country&rsquo;s democratic development.  Opposition parties are contesting the elections throughout the country and 30 million Ethiopians have registered to vote.  However, the violent aftermath of the last elections in 2005 left a disappointing and difficult legacy.  We are following developments closely and Irish observers are participating in the European Union elections observation mission.</P>
        <P>In February, the European Commission sought nominations from member states for experienced election observers to participate in the European Union election observation mission in Ethiopia.  It is Government policy to consider such requests positively.  Since 2004, more than 500 Irish election observers have participated in more than 80 election observation missions.</P>
        <P>In response to the Commission&rsquo;s request, we nominated six long-term observers and seven short-term observers for the current mission in Ethiopia.  Of these nominations, the European Commission selected six observers, three of whom are long-term observers and are based in Ethiopia from 23 April to 3 June.  Three are short-term observers based in the country from 14 to 29 May.  All of the Irish observers are highly experienced.</P>
        <P>The EU observation mission consists of 90 long-term observers and 60 short-term observers drawn from all the member states.  I am confident the Irish observers will play an important role in the mission and will make a positive contribution to the development of democratic accountability in Ethiopia.</P>
        <P>Despite some notable achievements in poverty reduction, Ethiopia remains one of the poorest countries in the world.  It has a large and growing population dependent on subsistence farming.  Many people remain unable to provide enough food for themselves.  Vulnerability to food supply shocks is acute and last year 6 million people required emergency food assistance.  This is the context in which Ethiopia will hold its fourth parliamentary and regional elections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I know the value of having observers as I was one with the EU group in Cambodia some years ago and it was very important.  The Minister of State mentioned the enormous scale of the elections, which I accept.  All Irish aid to Ethiopia, whether for the public works scheme or the scheme aimed at reducing malnutrition, is very valuable but with 47% of the population living under the poverty line, it is a huge task.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>When I was in Cambodia with the EU delegation, we met the EU ambassadors at an early stage so they could give us assistance in reading the situation in the different regions.  I went to Kampong Chhnang.  I understand severe restrictions have been placed on a number of Euro<Col N="842"/>pean Union embassies in regard to travel in Ethiopia.  That is a severe disability not only for the embassies, but for the observer missions from the different European Union countries.  I understand one of the leaders of the opposition, I believe the leader of Unity for Democracy and Justice, has been recommitted to prison, which is very difficult.</P>
        <P>There is a gap of approximately three weeks between the polling day and the announcement of the results.  What will happen during that period?  Will the African innovation which has happened in recent times of posting the turnout outside the polling station take place in Ethiopia?  Will it be available to the observers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The travel restrictions imposed by the authorities are naturally of great concern to us.  We have always had free access to all parts of the country.  The system involves applying for permits to leave Addis Ababa to travel north and south, although all permits applied for have been granted.  Nevertheless, it is of concern that a foreign country, which has a partnership arrangement with the Ethiopian Government, must apply for permission to leave the capital, especially during election time.</P>
        <P>The leader of the opposition to whom Deputy Higgins referred, Ms Birtukan Mideksa, is still in prison.  She was released as part of a 2007 pardon arrangement but she was imprisoned again because statements she made about the 2007 process were regarded as having violated the terms of her pardon.  This is also of concern to us.  I raised the concerns of the Irish authorities when I visited Ethiopia last year.  Together with our EU partners, our embassy in Addis Ababa continues to monitor her situation very closely and regularly raises our interest in her case directly with the Ethiopian authorities.</P>
        <P>In terms of the election count, it takes what appears to be an unnaturally long time &mdash; three to four weeks &mdash; but that is for the final result.  Results are published as they are counted in the individual areas, although the time appears to be quite long.  However, one must accept this is a rapidly growing population covering a huge area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the restrictions on EU embassies, is there co-ordination between the EU embassies and is there a role for facilitation by the high representative?  Has there been some intervention at that level?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am very disturbed by the implications of the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
        <P>After the 2005 elections, the announcement from Addis Ababa by the EU observer mission on the basis of a partial count had consequences that could only be described as disastrous.  It is now accepted within the European Union that the mission represented a singular failure in election observation.  The problem about the disparity in party support between the capital and rural areas was such that the announcement of partial results was interpreted as national.</P>
        <P>This is a very sensitive issue.  As the Carter Institute has not sent election observers to Ethiopia even though it has a fine record in this area, it is important that partial statements are not made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies make valid points.  The 2005 elections were very unsatisfactory and the subsequent violence was disturbing.  This year&rsquo;s parliamentary election is the fourth since the Derg was overthrown in 1991 and one hopes by now that democratic principles will be observed.  For this reason, the EU is investing considerable effort in its observation mission and a number of highly trained observers are already on the ground.  Only the best <Col N="843"/>and most experienced observers are being deployed on this occasion and they have all attended three-day courses to make them aware of issues specific to Ethiopia.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>On Deputy Creighton&rsquo;s question, I am not aware whether the high representative has taken an interest in the issue but, given the effort that the EU has invested in the mission, I imagine she will be kept fully apprised of developments.  We will await the outcome of the election process and the results with great interest.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  if he supports the Nairobi Declaration on Taxation and Development of 8 April 2010 which dealt with the issues of abusive transfer flows by multinational corporations in Africa </Quest>
        <QRef>[20926/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Nairobi declaration on taxation and development is an important statement of concern by civil society actors in Africa on the interrelated issues of domestic taxation, revenues from natural resource extraction and international taxation.  These issues have been prominent on the international agenda recently as a result of efforts at United Nations, OECD and European Union levels, with the full participation and support of the Government.</P>
        <P>Domestic revenue raises around ten times more financing for Africa than development assistance.  For developing countries in Africa, the mobilisation of domestic resources through efficient and fair tax systems is crucial for sustainable growth, poverty reduction and the provision of services so that the millennium development goals can be achieved.  Efficient and fair tax systems are also essential for promoting democracy and state legitimacy because taxpayers are more likely to hold their governments to account.</P>
        <P>Capital flight, including tax evasion and avoidance, and illicit financial flows are a major obstacle to domestic resource mobilisation.  A report recently commissioned by the Norwegian Government found that illegal money flows from developing countries are at least seven times higher than official development assistance.  This is facilitated by tax systems vulnerable to harmful tax practices and unco-operative jurisdictions, and it requires joint efforts between developed and developing countries.</P>
        <P>I welcome the recent European Commission communication on tax and development which charts the way forward for the EU in addressing these issues.  Enhanced efforts will be made to strengthen support to domestic resource mobilisation in developing countries .  The OECD, through collaboration between the committee on fiscal affairs and the development assistance committee, has an important role to play in ensuring developing countries get a fair share of taxes in a more transparent international tax environment.  The Government is participating fully in these OECD efforts through the Department of Finance and Irish Aid, which are collaborating on the issues of concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Irish Aid is of great assistance in these matters.  I refer specifically to Tanzania where a new gold mine has been opened every year since 1998.  A study funded by Christian Aid indicates that, between 2000 and 2008, &euro;265.5 million in taxes were lost because of gross abuse by extractive industries.  Putting this figure in context, Tanzania receives &euro;470 million in aid in a full year.</P>
        <P>Tanzania is the largest gold producer after South Africa, yet life expectancy is 55 years and <i>per capita</i> expenditure on children&rsquo;s education is less than $48.  It is being robbed right, left and centre by extractive mining companies.  The Nairobi declaration would address this sort of scandal by requiring companies to publish results in the countries in which they operate, allowing African countries to survey the extent of their minerals before they sign mining agree<Col N="844"/>ments and ensuring bodies such as the EU do not facilitate the declaration of bogus losses.  Each of the companies involved in Tanzania declares losses of approximately &euro;500 million per year to avoid paying taxes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns and assure him that Irish Aid is very active on this issue.  I am glad the Christian Aid report acknowledges that the Government is aware of the importance of a coherent and effective development aid response.</P>
        <P>In regard to mineral rich countries such as Tanzania, which the Deputy cites, Uganda and Zambia, the extractive industry transparency initiative, which is part of the EU-Africa governance partnership, has been instrumental in supporting improved governance and accountability through the verification and full publication of company payments and government revenues from oil, gas and mining.  Further progress on this initiative is being encouraged by Irish Aid.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s basic point is that multinational companies use their huge capacity and the professional advice available to them to engage in abhorrent practices, including transfer pricing and false invoicing.  While Irish Aid&rsquo;s programmes are not directly affected by these illicit practices, they have the capacity to undermine all development actors in the countries with which we work.  For this reason, we need a global approach which would involve the G20, the EU and the OECD.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree it is a pity that the Irish Aid strategy paper for Tanzania did not refer specifically to abuses by mining companies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Our activities in regard to multinational exploration companies are focused through the OECD and the EU on information sharing initiatives.  It is not an issue on which we must work on a bilateral basis with the countries concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps we should do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 22 together.</P>
        <P>Israel, along with Estonia and Slovenia, was formally invited to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development at a meeting of the OECD Council on 10 May 2010.  On the basis of formal opinions and all relevant technical information gathered by the appropriate OECD bodies during the accession process which stretched back to 2007, the Secretary General of the OECD recommended to the council that Israel be invited to accede.  The 31 member countries of the council, including Ireland, accepted that recommendation at the meeting of 10 May.</P><Col N="845"/>
        <P>An invitation to accede to the OECD is based on the applicant country&rsquo;s compliance with the organisation&rsquo;s rules and practice built up over the past 50 years and does not relate to or imply approval for other actions or policies of the state concerned.</P>
        <P>In its statement on the successful conclusion of the accession negotiations with Israel on 10 May, the European Union recalled commitments made by Israel during the accession period, including in regard to the geographical scope of the statistics provided for the OECD, and also restated its position that, in line with international law, the European Union would not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 borders, including in respect of Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties.</P>
        <P>Ireland, in common with a significant number of OECD members, continues to be deeply concerned about several aspects of Israeli policy towards its Palestinian neighbours, including its settlement policy and the blockade of Gaza.  I have consistently called on Israel to bring to an end these policies, as have successive Governments in the past.  I repeat that call today.  On acceding to the OECD, Israel, as well as all other new members, will be subject to vigorous and objective peer review processes across a range of areas, including potentially sensitive ones such as labour standards and issues relating to income inequality and discrimination.  We intend to work with partners in ensuring Israel fully complies with all the obligations arising from OECD membership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s stance on Israel in the past, but on this occasion I express my disappointment which will undoubtedly be shared by other supporters of Palestine.  Given his statement to <i>The New York Times</i> on 5 March that the &ldquo;medieval siege conditions&rdquo; being imposed on Gaza are unacceptable, how could he agree or assent to Israel&rsquo;s membership of an organisation which is supposed to be committed to fundamental values, including a pluralist society based on the rule of law and respect for human rights?  How does his acceptance of Israel&rsquo;s membership of the OECD square with the view he expressed in the D&aacute;il that the effective isolation of Gaza constituted &ldquo;collective punishment&rdquo; and was illegal under international humanitarian law?  It beggars belief that a country that has been censored internationally to such a degree and consistently ignored that censorship should become part of the OECD.  Why should less stringent criteria apply in respect of membership of that organisation than is the case in regard to Israel&rsquo;s membership of or trade agreements with other international organisations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>My position remains that the Gaza blockade is unacceptable and represents a fundamental breach of international human rights and norms.  I have always been clear in that regard.  Ireland has always maintained a significant interest in and commitment to Middle East issues, particularly efforts to effect a resolution of the conflict there.  There are several routes one could take to highlight and focus on these issues.  Some NGO campaigners have argued for a complete boycott and divestment policy and so on.  However, such a policy would reduce one&rsquo;s influence over the various interlocutors in the Middle East conflict and could undermine one&rsquo;s credibility in addressing the issues involved with all the stakeholders.  There is a balance to be struck in one&rsquo;s approach to the matter.  I would like to say more, but the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has indicated that my time is up.  It is difficult to address the points raised within a short timeframe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty in accepting the sincerity of the Minister&rsquo;s position on Gaza.  However, reports in the Israeli press suggest Ireland, with Switzerland and Norway, initially had reservations about voting for the acceptance of Israel into the OECD but that in the end, like what happened in respect of the United States-India nuclear non-proliferation agreement, they caved in.  The Secretary General of the OECD has said all of this is <Col N="846"/>justified and will contribute to a more pluralist and open OECD.  I take him to mean that when it comes to moral issues or issues of occupation such as how one handles the question of what is produced in the settlement of the Occupied Territories on the West Bank, the OECD will always look the other way and take the short-term economic argument as opposed to the politically moral one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The invitation to Israel, Slovenia and Estonia was given back in 2007, at which stage Ireland did not oppose it.  This is entirely incomparable to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty agreement with India.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my understanding a reservation was entered early on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have outlined my position.  Moreover, I have written to every Deputy setting out our position on boycotts.  We have argued that there is a balance to be struck in these matters.  In regard to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty mentioned by the Deputy, Ireland is cheering the Middle East resolution because of the acceptance by all concerned of our bona fides.  These are issues we must weigh up in terms of influencing events.</P>

The aim of introducing regulatory standards is to monitor the standard of care and improve the quality of life for older people in residential care settings.  In the light of several recent high-profile cases in which standards were shown to be inadequate and the care given to vulnerable older people way below what was acceptable, the legislation under the Health Act 2007 was timely.</P>
        <P>At the time these standards were introduced, it was stated the inspection fee was not due or payable by individual residents or their families.  We have been repeatedly told since that payment of these charges was a matter between the authority and nursing home providers.  As such, I am concerned about complaints from the families of individual residents of a nursing home that they are being invoiced directly for these HIQA inspection charges.  Before raising this matter in the House, I contacted representatives of HIQA and the nursing home in question.  HIQA has categorically stated the charges were never intended to be passed on to the families of individual residents.</P>
        <P>To my dismay, however, the nursing home in questin has provided written confirmation that it is directly invoicing individual residents for the charges and is doing so on the basis of comments made by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, at the press conference at which the national quality standards were launched on 9 March  2009.  According to nursing home management, the Minister said in response to a question from a journalist that she accepted that the charges would &ldquo;clearly be passed on&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>There is clearly a divergence of opinion between HIQA, the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, and residential care providers as to how these charges are to be paid.  This matter is sufficiently important as to require the Minister or her representative to come to House and clarify the matter once and for all.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government places great importance on the policies and practical reforms we are implementing to ensure patient safety and quality assured health services.  I assume the registration and inspection fee Deputy is referring to is in respect of designated centres or nursing homes for older people.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2007 provides for the registration and inspection of all nursing homes.  Inspections are carried out by the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority.  It is important to have effective mechanisms to maintain and enhance public confidence in the delivery of quality residential care.  Residents, their families and members of the public need to be reassured that the authority is monitoring the care people receive.  It is important, therefore, to have an effective, robust, independent and properly resourced inspection regime for residential services for older people.  This involves substantial costs on the Exchequer and it was considered appropriate that these costs should largely be met by the service providers.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, it was decided that the fees to be charged by HIQA to such providers, including those operating in both the public and private sectors, should be largely on a self-funding basis.  Such fees are provided for in the Health Act 2007.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children examined HIQA&rsquo;s estimates of the resources it would require to carry out the registration and inspection function.  As a result, it was estimated <Col N="848"/>that the minimum additional annual funding required would be &euro;4.5 million.  This covers staffing costs for the inspectorate.  Capital and other operational costs will, for the time being, be met within HIQA&rsquo;s overall existing allocation.</P>
        <P>Since 1 July 2009 all nursing homes, public and private, are registered under the Health Act 2007 (Registration of Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 by the chief inspector.  All nursing homes, public and private, will also be inspected under the new care and welfare regulations and patient focused quality standards.  Since this date nursing homes pay an annual fee of &euro;190 per place and a registration fee of &euro;500 every three years for the registration and inspection regime of the authority.  This constitutes an average weekly cost of &euro;3.73 per registered place.  Effectively, nursing homes contribute to the cost of regulation as a normal business cost, as occurs in other regulated sectors.</P>
        <P>The fees are payable by the registered provider or are to be included by an applicant when applying for registration.  Residents should only be charged those fees set out in their agreed contract with the provider.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, is aware that, as with many other sectors, there are financial pressures in the nursing home sector.  In this regard, she was pleased, at the suggestion of nursing home owners, to include in regulation a mechanism for the annual fee to be paid by the registered provider in three equal instalments each year to help address this issue.</P>
        <P>As I am sure the Deputy will agree, lessons had to be learned from well publicised incidents in nursing homes in recent years and reports such as that of the Leas Cross commission of investigation published only last year.  This new system of regulation and inspection, which was introduced in July 2009, is to underpin quality and safety for residents in nursing homes.  We have also introduced a new system of financial support, fair deal, for residents in all nursing homes from last October to ensure access is affordable and anxiety free for all.  In this context, the Government considers it reasonable that the nursing home sector should contribute towards these important developments in assuring quality care for some of the most vulnerable people in our society.</P>
        <P>If Deputy Behan provides me with details of a specific case, I will have it investigated on his behalf.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important and specific matter, namely, delays in clearance for volunteers and participants in forthcoming summer projects.  In my constituency, stretching from East Wall to the Navan Road and the markets area to Cabra, groups and communities depend on volunteers to run projects throughout the summer.  In some cases, these summer projects provide the only opportunity for children to take part in structured activities and may be the only break a parent will get in the summer.  They are extremely important to communities in my area.  The alternative is that children will have no option but to hang around and we have all seen the result of this type of activity on numerous occasions. </P>
        <P>In recent years, Dublin City Council has built a successful framework for summer projects.  Delays in clearing workers and volunteers can be highly damaging given that these summer projects have become a major part of life in local communities to which people look forward <Col N="849"/>for a whole year.  They take place when children are off school and, as I stated, they sometimes provide the only opportunity a child will have to take part in certain activities.</P>
        <P>I am aware of delays in clearing applicants for some community employment schemes and training courses, specifically in areas involving children, vulnerable adults and older people.   Everyone fully accepts that checks must be made.  In light of a number of incidents of abuse and malpractice in recent years, the highest standards are required, particularly where the care of children is concerned.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure the resources needed to ensure effective and effective clearance are provided, particularly as the summer projects will soon commence.</P>

	<P>I am replying to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I thank Deputy Cyprian Brady for raising it.  It may be helpful if I outline briefly the background to the system of Garda employment vetting that operates at present.  The Garda central vetting unit provides employment vetting to a large number of organisations registered with the Garda for this purpose and which employ or engage persons, whether in a paid or voluntary capacity, for posts where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>In response to a written request for vetting, which is only made with the consent of the person in question, the vetting unit releases criminal history information in respect of the person concerned to the prospective recruiting organisation.  It is important to emphasise, however, that Garda employment vetting is only one element of the overall recruitment process and that there is a range of other factors which the recruiting body or organisation should take into account when coming to a decision on a person&rsquo;s suitability.</P>
        <P>The Garda employment vetting service has undergone a significant expansion in recent years.  This strategic expansion is taking place by way of a phased roll-out to an increasing number of organisations in the child and vulnerable adult care sectors.  The House will understand that this target group is the clear policy priority.  Phasing the expansion of vetting is necessary to prevent an unmanageable surge in vetting application numbers, which would likely lead to an administrative logjam.</P>
        <P>The Garda vetting unit has successfully managed a significant growth in the number of vetting applications it receives to the point where it dealt with almost 250,000 applications last year, an increase from 137,000 in 2006.  The average processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year owing to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase greatly, for example, for summer camps and training placements.  The Garda authorities indicate that the average processing time for valid vetting applications received at the vetting unit may vary from four to five weeks in periods of lower demand to up to about 12 weeks at times when demand is particularly high.</P>
        <P>In any individual case additional time may be required to process a vetting application where clarification or further information is required as to the details provided or where other inquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  While a reasonably significant period will always be required to process a vetting application, the Garda makes every effort to reduce this to the minimum period possible, consistent with carrying out the checks required.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the deployment of Garda personnel is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner, taking into account all his requirements.  From the outset of the expansion of the vetting service, significant additional resources have been deployed to the vetting unit.  A total of 83 personnel are currently assigned to the vetting unit, including six garda&iacute; and 77 <Col N="850"/>Garda civilian personnel.  Five additional temporary personnel are being recruited and it is intended that these personnel will commence work during next month.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Taken in the aggregate, these figures, constitute a significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the vetting unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development of the Garda vetting service began in 2005.  Approximately 18,000 organisations are in receipt of vetting services from the Garda vetting unit for employment purposes, covering the wide range of health, educational, sporting and recreational sectors.  The Garda manages contacts with these organisations through more than 800 single points of contact.  An essential feature of the current vetting system is the partnership approach that has been adopted with the various organisations.  The Garda vetting unit provides ongoing support and advice to the organisations in question in managing their vetting requirements.</P>

      <Title>Dublin-Monaghan Bombings</Title>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>A commemoration ceremony took place on 17 May on Talbot Street to mark the deaths in 1974 of 27 people in Dublin and seven people in Monaghan in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  It was organised by Justice for the Forgotten and it is the commemorative symbol for all those who have died in the Troubles south of the Border.  Justice for the Forgotten is the group that has drawn the relatives together.  There were representatives at the commemoration from Northern Ireland, most counties in Ireland and from Scotland and all had relatives who tragically died in those bombings, and in other bombings in 1972, 1973 and at other times.</P>
        <P>It transpires that Justice for the Forgotten will have to close its doors at the end of June unless it can source funding because the Government has indicated to the group that it no longer intends to provide funding.  It has been refused and the group is not in a position to carry on, even in the short term, unless some source of funding is available.  This is a serious matter.</P>
        <P>Under the Good Friday Agreement, I believe there is a legal obligation on the Government to provide funding to the group, because it is the recognised body and the only dedicated one in the Republic of Ireland dealing with the Troubles here.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, <Col N="851"/>there is recognition for supporting organisations for the victims of the Troubles in the North, so both sections of the island are covered.  While funding is retained and adequate in Northern Ireland for the organisations that are working with the relatives and the victims of the Troubles there, it seems as though the carpet will be pulled from under the only organisation in the Republic of Ireland.  That is a disproportionate response to the situation and I believe the Government is in breach of the Good Friday Agreement in that respect.</P>
        <P>Justice for the Forgotten deals with the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, but also with other events such as the film centre bombing, the Miami band bombing, the Dublin Airport bombing, the Dundalk bombing and the Castleblayney bombing, as well as various shootings that took place in the Border area.  There are also many people who suffered atrocities but who have since moved into this jurisdiction and receive a service from the group.  Justice for the Forgotten carries out a very large operation.  It provides a service to all and sundry, irrespective of their background and the position they might have taken on the political situation of the day.</P>
        <P>In June 2009, I asked what was going on in respect of all this and I was told by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that his priority was to ensure that the long-term expenses of the survivors of incidents in this jurisdiction would be met.  That focus is far too narrow because we are not talking about expenses, but rather a support service and a counselling service provided by the group.  A previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy Michael McDowell, stated that &euro;9 million was earmarked to be made available for the Remembrance Commission.  I would be obliged if the Minister can tell me if there is still some balance in that fund.  If there is, then it should be made available.</P>
        <P>I know of the work that has been undertaken by Justice for the Forgotten.  I know of the contribution it has made to the various reports that have come before these Houses.  I know of the work that is done on the ground on a daily basis.  It would not just be a shame, but also very damaging to many people if funding for the group was taken away.  I urge the Minister to meet with the group&rsquo;s representatives directly and see if a position can be negotiated so that some funding can be put in place and the work can then continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying to this matter this evening on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I thank Deputy Costello for raising it.</P>
        <P>The Government is mindful of the great pain and suffering caused to people, both North and South, during the period of conflict in Northern Ireland.  We are all particularly conscious of the burden that has been borne by the survivors and the families of the victims of so many brutal attacks, including the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974, which are always in our minds at this time of the year.  The Minister recognises fully the good work that has been undertaken by Justice for the Forgotten in the past, particularly its contribution to the Barron inquiry.</P>
        <P>The Good Friday Agreement acknowledged the need to address the suffering of victims and recognised their right to remember that suffering.  Arising from the Good Friday Agreement, the Government established the victims commission in 1998, under former T&aacute;naiste John Wilson, to conduct a review of the services and arrangements in place in this jurisdiction to meet the needs of those who had suffered as a result of the conflict in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report of the victims commission, A Place and a Name, made a number of recommendations, including the provision of acknowledgement and other payments to victims and their families.  The Remembrance Commission was established to oversee the disbursement of such payments under the terms of the scheme of acknowledgement, remembrance and assistance for victims in this jurisdiction of the conflict in Northern Ireland.</P><Col N="852"/>
        <P>The scheme of acknowledgement also provided for the allocation of funding to victim support groups in respect of the provision of counselling services.  Under this element of the scheme, payments were made to Justice for the Forgotten for the purpose of meeting the counselling and other needs of victims or the family members of victims, and the Minister has asked me to pay tribute to their great work in this area.  The funding of these services was made in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and the Minister does not accept the assertions that have been made that somehow the Government has reneged on its commitments in this regard.</P>
        <P>During the period of operation of the scheme of acknowledgement, Justice for the Forgotten received &euro;1.2 million out of the total of &euro;1.5 million allocated for victim support services, and it was the only recipient of money under this heading.  In addition, the organisation received over &euro;890,000 from the Department of the Taoiseach between 2000 and 2003.</P>
        <P>The term of appointment of the remembrance commission, originally set at three years, was extended for a further two years and came to an end in 2008.  The funding which was previously provided under the terms of the scheme of acknowledgement was, therefore, no longer available.  However, following the end of the remembrance commission&rsquo;s term of appointment, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made further moneys available to Justice for the Forgotten in order to enable it to seek to put in place alternative sources of funding.  In these very difficult financial times, some hard decisions have had to be made.  The priority of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, as he has stated, must be ensuring that the ongoing medical expenses of victims in this jurisdiction of the conflict in Northern Ireland continue to be provided for.  Any available funding must be directed to that and, to this end, the Minister has made arrangements for these costs to be looked after through the victims of crime office of his Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this unusual issue.  It will surprise most people to discover that County Laois does not have any direct social welfare office.  I ask the Minister to take the opportunity that now presents itself to reverse what I would call the long-established unacceptable practice where the Department of Social Protection, formerly the Department of Social and Family Affairs, contracts out the work of providing a social welfare service to a third party in County Laois.  It was probably an age-old practice that happened in many counties years ago.  It is a bit like post offices where the local postmaster provided the building and the staff.  However, in all major centres An Post now runs its own post offices directly.</P>
        <P>Up to now all Portlaoise had was a branch office run by a third party, who was not a direct employee.  He provided the building and hired the staff.  There was no criticism of the service supplied by the current and former manager and staff in Portlaoise.  They provided a service to the best of their ability for the Department.  Unfortunately the Department did not give them the level of autonomy to which the people of Laois would feel entitled in order to make decisions at local level.  I am raising the issue now because the Department of Social Protection placed an advertisement in last week&rsquo;s local newspapers seeking to fill the vacancy of manager of a social welfare branch office in Portlaoise, County Laois.</P>
        <P>This presents the ideal opportunity to act.  The Department has confirmed that the branch manager who has operated that service well over the years is retiring this summer.  The Department should use the opportunity to provide a direct office.  I was shocked, disappointed and angry that the Department took what appears to me the lazy option of reappointing a branch manager again.  This is an ideal opportunity because a vacancy now arises for the Department <Col N="853"/>to take a hands-on approach and provide its own office in Portlaoise to serve the entire county of Laois.  This would allow people make their social welfare claims, including applications for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and benefit and would also also for departmental staff in the office in Portlaoise who would be in a position to make decisions on those claims.</P>
        <P>According to the advertisement, the new person to be appointed will be obliged to provide the accommodation, which will need to meet health and safety standards and deal with the staff issues in a manner suitable to the Department.  I am asking the Department to postpone this decision.  I am sure it will be able to find people to temporarily move to Portlaoise to manage the service on a temporary basis until it gets a permanent office in Portlaoise to do this.  Through the decentralisation programme, 200 to 300 staff have already come from the Dublin region to work in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Portlaoise.  There is no shortage of people seeking to decentralise to Portlaoise.</P>
        <P>I raised the matter with the Minister a few days ago and I reported it to the local newspaper.  I have seen a response from the Department which indicates that it will ask the OPW to acquire premises for a new control office.  It states that the control office in Portlaoise will be a small office not accessible to members of the public and that it will take in the applications from Portlaoise, Portarlington and Rathdowney.  This is not even a half-way measure to what I am seeking.  I want a straight regular service that applies in practically every other county in Ireland.</P>
        <P>There are only two other locations in the country where the Department does not provide its own direct office.  I ask the Department to reconsider this.  In what we would call the main Government offices in Portlaoise there would be a small office for the Department of Social Protection for the inspectors who would deal with cases.  However, that is not a public office that is accessible generally.  Sometimes one is in trouble if called in there.  I will put it that way.</P>
        <P>The Acting Chairman will be surprised that a county like Laois has no social welfare office manned by the Department&rsquo;s own staff.  I do not agree that the new control office that is to be set up, which will not be accessible by the public, addresses my concerns.  There is a perfect opportunity for the Department to put in place temporary measures.  I submitted this motion at short notice and the Minister of State may not have a detailed comprehensive reply.  If the reply is not to the satisfaction of the people in County Laois, I will have no hesitation in meeting the Minister to discuss the matter in the coming days.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I thank the Deputy for raising it.  The Department delivers a front-line service through a network of 62 local offices and 62 branch offices and the service in Portlaoise is delivered by a branch office.  Branch offices are operated by private individuals on a contract for service basis.  The terms of these contracts specify a requirement to provide suitable accommodation and to maintain adequate staffing levels to enable the transaction of social welfare services.</P>
        <P>The main services provided by the branch office include jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, one-parent family payment and an information service.  All decisions on branch office claims are currently made in the parent local office.</P>
        <P>The Department is conscious of the need to ensure that an appropriate level of service is offered so that all its customers can have their business transacted in an efficient and timely manner.  Portlaoise, in common with all branch offices has dealt with a very significant increase in the number of persons registering as unemployed and this has naturally led to an increased demand for services.</P><Col N="854"/>
        <P>The Department regularly reviews the arrangements for delivering services in the area served by branch offices.  The branch manager in Portlaoise has notified the Department of his intention to retire in July 2010.  In such circumstances consideration is given to the possible retention of the branch office service, the opening of a departmentally staffed office or the relocation or amalgamation of services, taking account of local factors, including accommodation, lead in times and other issues.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances and in order to ensure service continuity in Portlaoise, the Department decided to advertise the branch manager position on the basis of a five-year contract.  Simultaneously the Department will proceed to open a departmental control office in Portlaoise.  The primary function of a control office, which is staffed by departmental staff, is to decide on claims taken in the branch offices reporting to it.  The Department plans to have the branch offices in Portlaoise, Portarlington and Rathdowney report to the proposed new control office in Portlaoise.  This approach, which should improve customer services in County Laois, will be kept under review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 21 together. </P>
        <P>The first Parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka since the end of the civil war were held on 8 April. The campaign was quite peaceful by local standards although there were serious irregularities in two constituencies which necessitated new elections on 20 April. The United People&rsquo;s Freedom Alliance (UPFA), the party of President Rajapaksa, secured a landslide victory, though it did not secure the two-thirds majority it had sought. Nevertheless, following his own re-election as President on 26 January, President Rajapaksa now has the parliamentary backing to undertake a major initiative on national reconciliation. I hope he will take this opportunity so that real change can be secured for the Tamil minority and for all the people of Sri Lanka.</P>
        <P>In the first instance, the humanitarian situation must be addressed. While conditions have considerably improved in the camps in the year since the end of the war, with approximately 93,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) remaining in Vavuniya, the conditions facing those who have returned home (some 100,000 former IDPs) remain a cause for real concern. In addition, a remaining legacy of the conflict is the approximately 10,500 former Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) fighters who continue to be held in closed camps.</P>
        <P>In parallel with humanitarian measures, a genuine process of dialogue and reconciliation must be initiated in Sri Lanka with a view to securing sustainable peace for all the people of the island. Without reconciliation there can be no return to long-term security or prosperity for Sri Lanka. Such a process should involve the UN and others in the international community. <Col N="856"/>In this context, I hope that the Sri Lankan Government will facilitate the long-awaited visit of Lynn Pascoe, the UN Under Secretary-General for Political Affairs, to the country as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Permanent People&rsquo;s Tribunal on Sri Lanka was held in Dublin in January 2010. It was an NGO-led exercise which concluded that the Government and military of Sri Lanka were guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the civil war. The conclusions support the widely held view that serious breaches of international humanitarian law occurred during and after the final stages of the civil war.</P>
        <P>While Ireland welcomes the recommendations made by the Tribunal, it is disappointing that the Tribunal considered only the actions of the Government and military of Sri Lanka and did not examine the actions of LTTE forces, thereby leaving its work open to criticism by the Government of Sri Lanka and others.</P>
        <P>As reported to Deputies on 16 February, the recommendations made by the Tribunal are supported by the Government. One of these is for a UN-led inquiry into war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated during the war between the Sri Lankan armed forces and the LTTE. Others include the need for IDPs and detainees to be allowed to return to their homes without delay and the need to continue working on a sustainable peace process addressing all issues of concern, with an international role in monitoring and supporting the process.</P>
        <P>Ireland will continue with its efforts, both bilaterally and with our partners in the EU, to support the peace process in Sri Lanka and to work towards remedying the plight of the IDPs and other detainees still in the camps. During 2009 and 2010, Irish Aid has allocated a total of &euro;478,000 in humanitarian funding to Sri Lanka. Our allocation in 2010 includes support for the post-operative rehabilitation of people severely injured in the conflict. A member of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps has recently returned from his second deployment to Sri Lanka, where he was working as a field officer with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 42 and 51 together. </P>
        <P>Since 2002, the EU has been negotiating a series of important new agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (or ACP) group of States. These Economic Partnership Agreements combine both trade and development provisions. The negotiations are being carried out by the European Commission, on behalf of the European Community and the Member States.</P>
        <P>The negotiations are necessary as a result of rulings by the World Trade Organisation that the unilateral trade preferences which the EU had granted to the ACP countries established unfair discrimination between developing countries. The mandate for the negotiations is derived from the Cotonou Agreement of 2000, between the EU and the ACP States. The <Col N="857"/>central objective is the reduction and eventual eradication of poverty, consistent with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy.</P>
        <P>It had been hoped that comprehensive Agreements with six regional groupings of the ACP States could be concluded by the end of 2007, the deadline set by the WTO. However, following a process of protracted and difficult negotiation, only one of the ACP regional groups, representing Caribbean States, was in a position to initial a full Agreement before the deadline. In order to avoid trade disruption, interim Agreements were agreed and initialled at the end of 2007 with 21 other ACP States. These interim Agreements provide for full duty and quota-free market access on the EU side and a flexible and asymmetric trade liberalisation schedule on the ACP side. They include development cooperation provisions and provide for improved rules of origin.</P>
        <P>Ireland has so far signed the full Economic Partnership Agreement with the Caribbean States and interim Agreements with Cameroon, C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, Ghana and members of the Southern African Development Community. The Government has submitted a D&aacute;il Motion, which is currently on the Order Paper, seeking approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the terms of the three interim Agreements<b> </b>referred to by the Deputies. The three Agreements in question cover a total of 16 African countries.</P>
        <P>I believe that these Agreements provide an open, transparent and legal framework for trade and development, and will encourage the gradual integration of the ACP States into the global economy. They are interim agreements, but represent important building blocks to full regional Economic Partnership Agreements, which are under negotiation.</P>
        <P>Ireland has worked consistently, in cooperation with a number of other EU partners, to ensure that the final Agreements strongly support the development needs of the ACP countries, and specifically their poverty reduction programmes. At meetings of EU Development Ministers, I have stressed the importance of maintaining a negotiating approach which would, for example, allow for application of the trade flexibility permissible under WTO law. We will continue to work with our EU partners, and with partner countries in the developing world, to ensure that the negotiations being led by the European Commission serve to strengthen the EU&rsquo;s partnership with the ACP States.</P>

	<P>I am committed to a number of foreign trips for the remainder of 2010. As always all my travel as Minister for Foreign Affairs is carried out in pursuit of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy objectives, our economic interests, or both. The majority of my travel arises directly from Ireland&rsquo;s active and committed membership of the EU and UN. </P>
        <P>It is my intention to attend the next meetings of the General Affairs Council and the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg on Monday June 14th and, as is usual, I will continue to attend Council meetings on a monthly basis throughout 2010. On September 10-11th the Belgian EU Presidency will host an informal Foreign Ministers meeting which I will attend. I will also attend a meeting of the European Council on September 16th.</P>
        <P>As is customary, I am due to travel to New York in late September to attend the Ministerial week which marks the start of the new UN General Assembly session. The primary purpose <Col N="858"/>of my visit will be to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s national statement to the General Assembly and also to undertake a series of bilateral meetings with senior UN officials and other Foreign Ministers.</P>
        <P>Other visits which are now confirmed include a visit to China later this month, where I will meet with Vice Premier Li Keqiang, Foreign Minister Li Jiechi, and a range of Irish companies doing business in China, as well as with members of the Global Irish Network. I will also visit Expo 2010 in Shanghai and other institutions which are developing links with Ireland.</P>
        <P>In late June and early July I plan to visit Uganda and Ethiopia, two of the nine priority countries for the Government&rsquo;s bilateral aid programme. The main purpose of my visit is to see at first-hand how Irish Aid is supporting the reduction of poverty and hunger in both of these countries. During this visit I will have the opportunity to meet with senior members of the Ugandan and Ethiopian Governments, with Irish NGOs and missionaries working in Uganda and Ethiopia, and with representatives of civil society. I will also pay a visit to the headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa to discuss the role of the African Union and the wider political situation on the African continent.</P>
        <P>I am also looking at the possibility of travelling to Argentina and Chile in July in the context of the Bicentennial celebrations in both countries. This would provide me with an opportunity to underpin the strong historic links that Ireland has with Argentina and Chile.</P>
        <P>I intend to host a meeting of the Global Irish Network in New York in November. It is envisaged that this will be the largest Network meeting to date and will provide the opportunity to explore with North America-based members how best we can utilise the Network to Ireland&rsquo;s benefit in 2011 and beyond.</P>
        <P>I plan to visit Russia in December. This will follow-up on the official visit paid by Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov to Dublin in September 2008. My visit will provide an opportunity to engage with the Russian leadership on bilateral and international issues and to advance Ireland&rsquo;s profile in Russia.</P>
        <P>Lastly, I intend to visit a number of countries in the Western Balkans during the second half of 2010 but the exact itinerary is not yet finalised.</P>

	<P>Ireland remains keenly committed to ongoing participation in UN-mandated peace support operations. Our involvement in overseas operations over more than 50 years has enabled the personnel of the Defence Forces to develop a broad range of skills and competencies which have given Ireland a strong and widely recognised reputation in the field of international peacekeeping. While the Government has reluctantly taken the decision to withdraw the bulk of our contingent from Chad, more than 100 members of the Permanent Defence Forces remain on active service with UN-mandated missions in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. In addition, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a number of civilian experts seconded by my Department are deployed in support of international crisis management operations. </P>
        <P>My Department, the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform continue to examine options for participation by Ireland in overseas operations. Most recently, the Government has despatched five members of the Defence Forces to serve <Col N="859"/>with the EU mission to assist the training of Somali Security Forces (EUTM Somalia). This UN-mandated mission, which was launched on 7 April 2010, is being carried out in Uganda.</P>
        <P>The Permanent Mission to the United Nations maintains active contact with the UN Secretariat, and in particular the Department of Peace Keeping Operations (DPKO), in connection with Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing contribution to UN-mandated crisis management. Requests received in relation to participation in peace support operations are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered.</P>

	<P>Since the House was last briefed on this case, during an Adjournment Debate on 11 November, there have been a number of developments in the case of Michael Dwyer, an Irish citizen who was killed by the Bolivian state security forces in Santa Cruz on 16 April 2009. </P>
        <P>Ambassador Philomena Murnaghan, the Ambassador of Ireland to Argentina, who is accredited also to Bolivia, travelled to La Paz on 17 February where she had a number of meetings, including with the Deputy Foreign Minister (Monica Soriano), the Prosecutor and the police investigators in the case. At these meetings, the Ambassador inquired as to progress in the Bolivian Government&rsquo;s investigation of the events surrounding Mr Dwyer&rsquo;s death. She urged the Government of Bolivia to hold an international investigation into the events of 16 April 2009 and reiterated that Ireland was available to provide assistance to, and to cooperate with, the Bolivian Government in an international investigation of this matter.</P>
        <P>During the meeting with Minister Soriano, Ambassador Murnaghan was given information which allowed the State Pathologist, Dr Marie Cassidy to supplement her earlier findings. Dr Cassidy prepared a further report, which I have forwarded to the Bolivian Foreign Minister. In my letter to the Minister, I urged him to provide me with the outcome of the Bolivian investigation at the earliest possible opportunity. I will also seek an opportunity to have a meeting with the Foreign Minister, where I will indicate my ongoing concerns about the case.</P>
        <P>I have written also to the UN Special Rapporteur for Extra-Judicial Killings to support his efforts in seeking clarification from the Bolivian authorities of the events of 16 April 2009.</P>
        <P>I have met with the Dwyer family on a number of occasions, most recently on 14 April. I wish to assure you that I and my officials will persist in our efforts to clarify the circumstances surrounding Mr Dwyer&rsquo;s death and will continue to remain in direct contact with the Dwyer family.</P>

	<P>The Department of Foreign Affairs, either through the Consular Assistance Section or our Missions overseas, receive a number of inquires each year in relation to Irish citizens that cannot be contacted by families or friends. It is important to recall that people go missing for a variety of reasons, including, in some cases, <Col N="860"/>as a result of a deliberate decision to cease contact with family or friends. Nevertheless, losing contact with a family member or friend who is travelling or resident overseas can be, and frequently is, very distressing. </P>
        <P>The Department will do what is possible to assist families to liaise and provide information to local police authorities overseas to help to ascertain any information on the whereabouts of any Irish citizens reported as missing. However, the operational responsibility for conducting searches overseas rests with the local police forces and my Department cannot conduct physical searches on behalf of families. The normal procedure in cases where a family in Ireland believes that a family member is missing overseas is to report it to the local police station in order that they can request the assistance of Interpol to attempt to trace the missing person.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 24, 54 and 59 together. </P>
        <P>The International Donors&rsquo; Conference, The International Donors&rsquo; Conference, <i>Towards a New Future for Haiti</i>, which was held in New York on 31 March, signalled in very strong terms <Col N="861"/>the commitment of the international community to supporting the Government and people of Haiti in rebuilding their country after the devastation of the January earthquake. The conference mobilised more than US$9 billion in funding for Haiti&rsquo;s recovery and future development.</P>
        <P>Both the UN and EU remain at the centre of the international community&rsquo;s response to the earthquake, addressing the immediate basic needs of those who lost everything in this tragedy and assisting the Haitian Government as it works to implement its Action Plan for National Recovery and Development.</P>
        <P>I represented the Government at the New York Conference and pledged &euro;13 million over three years towards relief, recovery and development in Haiti. This includes &euro;1 million towards the cancellation of Haiti&rsquo;s remaining debt to the World Bank. In my statement in New York, I also highlighted the generosity of the Irish public in contributing millions of Euro to emergency appeals, as well as the role played by Irish NGOs.</P>
        <P>The total value to date of the Government&rsquo;s contribution in response to the Haiti earthquake is approximately &euro;4.5 million, incorporating both in-kind assistance and direct financing.</P>
        <P>In-kind assistance to Haiti included the airlift of more than 130 tonnes of shelter, water and sanitation equipment from our emergency stockpiles, representing Irish Aid&rsquo;s largest ever humanitarian airlift. These emergency relief items were distributed through three of our NGO partners, Concern, Goal and Tr&oacute;caire.</P>
        <P>The Irish Aid contribution also includes the deployment to date of nine members of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps. These highly skilled volunteers have been supporting the emergency operations of organisations such as the World Food Programme, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Concern and Goal.</P>
        <P>Direct emergency funding allocated by Irish Aid in response to the earthquake has amounted to more than &euro;3.2 million and covers a range of sectors, including sanitation, child protection, education, cash for work and agricultural recovery. Funding has been provided through three groups of partners:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />UN agencies, specifically the World Food Programme; UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs; UN Food and Agriculture Organisation; UN Environment Programme; and UN Human Settlements Programme;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The International Federation of the Red Cross, in support of the Haitian National Red Cross; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />NGOs, specifically Christian Aid, Concern, Goal, Haven, Plan Ireland and World Vision.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is clear &mdash; not least because of the direct impact of the earthquake on personnel and infrastructure &mdash; that the Haitian Government will require technical and other support from international experts in order to fully discharge its responsibilities. Consequently, Irish Aid has allocated &euro;200,000 to the UN Human Settlements Programme, UN-HABITAT, for the provision of technical and secretariat support services to the Haitian Government, to assist them and build their capacity in areas such as housing, social and physical infrastructure, and urban and spatial planning. UN-HABITAT carried out an extensive analysis of the urban spatial and planning requirements of Port au Prince prior to the earthquake and had already identified areas where improvements needed to be made to ensure a safer city.</P>
        <P>Finally, the UN and EU continue to provide humanitarian support in a wide range of other disaster contexts worldwide, including both natural disasters and conflict-related emergencies. <Col N="862"/>Natural disasters to which both the UN and EU have responded since the start of the year include the earthquake in Chile and recent flooding in Peru.</P>

        <Quest> the findings of the working groups set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Northern Assembly to examine the establishment of a North South Parliamentary Forum; if further consideration has been given to the proposal by the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly to hold a North South Parliamentary Conference; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I should state at the outset that this matter is one where the Oireachtas has primacy. </P>
        <P>The commitment to develop a joint parliamentary forum, which would bring together members from the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly, is contained in both the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements. The Government is committed to the full and effective implementation of these agreements; an aim which I know is shared by all in this House.</P>
        <P>In July 2007, at the first meeting of the North South Ministerial Council following restoration of the Institutions, the Council &ldquo;recognised that any development of a joint parliamentary forum is a matter for the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>At that time, provision was also made for officials from the two administrations to make contact with the Oireachtas and Assembly and to report back to the NSMC at the earliest opportunity on the prospects for the development of such a forum.</P>
        <P>Since then, the NSMC has received regular updates, including on the establishment of the working groups to which the Deputy refers. At the last NSMC Plenary in December 2009 the Council noted the proposal by the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly to hold a North South Parliamentary Conference.</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind the primacy of the Oireachtas on this issue, I can advise the House that I am aware that the work of both the Assembly and Oireachtas Working Groups is ongoing. The Oireachtas Working Group is chaired by the Ceann Comhairle and has all-party representation. On the issue of the proposal by the Speaker to hold a North South Parliamentary Conference, I understand that this suggestion has been taken up and that preparations are underway for such a meeting this autumn.</P>
        <P>It should be emphasised that, as work continues toward the setting-up of a North South parliamentary forum, contacts between members of the Oireachtas and Assembly also continue in other fora. I am aware, for example, that several Oireachtas Committees have had useful exchanges with their Assembly counterparts. In addition, the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly also provide valuable opportunities for parliamentarians North and South to engage on issues of mutual interest.</P>

        <Quest> if he is concerned at the development consequences of the conditions being imposed by the International Monetary Fund on some of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries, for example Mali, where such conditions have resulted in human disaster. </Quest>

	<P>Debt relief under the two main multilateral initiatives to tackle the debt burden on developing countries, as well as loans from the International Financial Institutions, are often conditional on the implementation of certain macro-economic and development policies. To be eligible, countries must demonstrate their commitment to sound economic management and poverty reduction through the implementation of a national Poverty Reduction Strategy. The purpose of such conditions is to ensure that countries have the right governance frameworks in place to manage their economic and social development in a sustainable manner. </P>
        <P>In March 2009, the International Monetary Fund updated its conditionality framework in the context of a comprehensive reform to strengthen its capacity to address economic crises. The main result is a commitment that conditions linked to IMF financing will be sufficiently focused and adequately tailored to individual countries&rsquo; policies and economic environments.</P>
        <P>Last month, I visited Washington for the development discussions at the Spring meetings of the World Bank and the IMF. I reiterated the Government&rsquo;s clear view that international policy and lending must be focused on the development needs of least developed countries and that this must be reflected in the ongoing reform processes of the International Financial Institutions. Ireland will continue to monitor the pace with which the World Bank and IMF review their policies on conditionality. In cooperation with other partners, Ireland will maintain pressure to ensure that, in all cases, conditionality is appropriate in terms of scope, content and application.</P>
        <P>We believe that all development interventions, including those of the International Financial Institutions, should be framed very clearly in the context of country ownership, poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</P>
        <P>The Deputy refers in particular to Mali, which is one of the 25 poorest countries in the world. Mali has made significant progress in recent years, particularly as a result of the granting of total debt relief by the international community. However, despite political and economic progress, Mali does not have a strong track record in translating overall economic growth into poverty reduction and the country remains heavily reliant on donor funds. It suffers from low levels of political participation, and has one of the worst records on adult literacy in Africa. Mali continues to face political, security and economic and social challenges.</P>
        <P>In February the International Monetary Fund completed its third review of Mali&rsquo;s economic performance under a programme supported by the Extended Credit Facility. The review was broadly positive, encouraging the Government of Mali to continue with the promotion of sustainable economic growth, with the objective of improving living standards, reducing poverty and making progress on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 156 together. </P><Col N="864"/>
        <P>I am very much aware of the difficulties confronting undocumented Irish citizens in the United States and the distress which both they and their families in the US and Ireland experience arising from their situation. I recognise that the overwhelming majority of the undocumented travelled to the US in search of work in a period of economic downturn in Ireland. I would urge anybody who might be tempted in the current climate to follow in the footsteps of the undocumented to take account of the difficult situation in which they now find themselves.</P>
        <P>Finding a solution for our undocumented citizens in the United States continues to be an important priority for this Government. We are also committed to enhancing our bilateral migration arrangements with the US through the establishment of a reciprocal two year renewable visa scheme, known as the E3 visa, and the further development of the recently agreed working holiday programme.</P>
        <P>During our St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit Washington, the Taoiseach and I took the opportunity to discuss immigration reform and the plight of the undocumented Irish in our meetings with President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and leading members of Congress. As part of his St Patrick&rsquo;s Day address, President Obama offered an assurance that his own commitment to comprehensive immigration reform remains unwavering.</P>
        <P>President Obama has since reiterated this commitment to immigration reform, and has welcomed what he has described as the &ldquo;strong proposal&rdquo; for reform presented at the end of April by senior Democratic Senators Harry Reid, Charles Schumer, and Robert Menendez.</P>
        <P>The Democratic Senators&rsquo; outline legislative proposal draws on the draft framework for action on immigration published in March by Senator Lindsay Graham and Senator Charles Schumer. This bipartisan proposal included provision for a path towards legalisation for the undocumented, including the Irish, provided they first admit to having violated US laws, undertake the repayment of taxes and perform community service.</P>
        <P>This outline legislation also specifically mentions an E-3 visa arrangement for Irish citizens. Although the proposal is only the first step in a long process, the inclusion of an Irish E3 scheme at this initial stage is an important achievement for the Government and the Irish community.</P>
        <P>While I am encouraged by these developments and also by the efforts which continue to be made on Capitol Hill to resolve this issue, very considerable political challenges remain, particularly in an election year.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to maintain very close contact with the US Administration and Congress, as well as with Irish community advocates, to address this issue in the period ahead. Through the Emigrant Support Programme, we have provided $285,000 to the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, since 2006, to assist with their lobbying efforts. In 2009, we also provided $10,000 to the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform.</P>

        <Quest>  if he has raised with the Iranian ambassador the continuing incarceration, without charge, of members of the Baha&rsquo;i community and the contravention involved of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have stated previously in the House, the case of the seven Baha&rsquo;i community leaders continues to be of grave concern. I have personally raised this case, and matters relating to human rights and religious freedom generally, directly with the Iranian authorities at the highest levels, including in person and by letter with Foreign Minister Mottaki. In addition, my Department frequently conveys my concerns on such matters to the Iranian Ambassador here. Officials of my Department also meet regularly with members of the Baha&rsquo;i community in Ireland; the most recent such meeting took place last January. </P>
        <P>The Baha&rsquo;i community leaders, who have been in detention for over two years now, have been charged with a number of offences, including &ldquo;spreading corruption on earth.&rdquo; Some of these offences attract the death penalty in Iran. This is of particular concern given that the Iranian authorities have increased their use of the death penalty in the past year. Just last week, the E.U. High Representative issued a strong statement condemning the execution of five Iranian citizens on 9 May.</P>
        <P>After numerous deferrals, the trial of the detained Baha&rsquo;i leaders began on 12 January and there were further hearings on 7 February and 12 April. The latest hearing was adjourned after the defence refused to participate because the detainees&rsquo; families were denied access to the hearing. The conditions in which the Baha&rsquo;i community leaders are confined are also a matter of serious disquiet. Furthermore, I am highly concerned about the continued persecution of the wider Baha&rsquo;i community in Iran, including reports of interrogations, arbitrary arrests and imprisonment, destruction of property and denial of education to Baha&rsquo;i students. This is taking place against a background of widespread oppression by the Iranian authorities, which has increased since the Presidential election in 2009.</P>
        <P>Iran is a signatory of the binding International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and as such is obliged to protect the rights guaranteed therein. Ireland took the opportunity to raise the Baha&rsquo;i community leaders&rsquo; case at the UN Human Rights Council last September and Ireland again supported consideration of these matters at the Human Rights Council in March. The E.U. High Representative issued a strong statement on 12 January, which Ireland fully supported, expressing the E.U.&rsquo;s acute concerns about the trial and the motivation for the charges brought. The E.U. has repeatedly drawn attention to the oppression perpetrated against the Baha&rsquo;i faith and its members by the Islamic Republic of Iran.</P>
        <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to monitor closely this particular case, the treatment of the wider Baha&rsquo;i community in Iran and other violations of human rights in Iran. The Government will also continue to bring our views to the notice of the Iranian authorities through bilateral contacts in Tehran, Dublin and elsewhere, as well as in cooperation with our E.U. partners.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality is not affected by our participation in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. Ireland&rsquo;s approach to international security is characterised, <i>inter alia</i>, by our willingness to participate in peace operations throughout the world and a commitment to collective security through the United Nations, in particular. </P><Col N="866"/>
        <P>Since 2001, ISAF has been deployed under the authority of the UN Security Council &mdash; which authorised the establishment of a force in the maintenance of security to enable the Afghan authorities as well as UN personnel to operate in a secure environment. ISAF has a peace enforcement mandate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and there are twelve UN Security Council Resolutions relating to ISAF, most recently UNSCR 1917 (2010).</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish, in particular, to note UN Security Council Resolution 1890 from 8 October last, which expressed appreciation for the contributions made by Member States to ISAF and continued to call upon Member States to contribute personnel, equipment and other resources to the mission stressing the role of ISAF in assisting the Afghan Government to improve the security situation in Afghanistan.</P>
        <P>Seven members of the Permanent Defence Forces are serving with ISAF in Kabul in non-combatant roles with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Their deployment fully accords with both Irish and international law and in no way impacts upon Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality. The service of the Defence Forces with ISAF represents a further example of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to participation in UN-mandated peace operations, a long-standing and key foreign policy principle for Ireland.</P>
        <P>I would also point out that other neutral and non-aligned States, including Austria, Finland and Sweden also contribute troops to ISAF.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 64 and 157 together.</P>
        <P>Following long efforts by Senator Mitchell and the US Administration to bring the parties together, and an abortive launch in April, the long-awaited proximity talks between the Israelis and Palestinians have commenced. The US team will liaise between the parties. Senator Mitchell will be present in person regularly and frequently, and further available as needed. It is envisaged that proximity talks will last for an initial period of four months, following which the parties will decide if there is a basis to continue with them or indeed to move to direct negotiations.</P>
        <P>There have of course been many previous rounds of direct negotiations between the parties, most recently in 2008. These earlier discussions will inform but not bind the evolution of the current talks. The key issues are sovereignty, borders, Jerusalem, security, refugees and water, all of which were discussed in earlier rounds. These are difficult issues, but they have been debated for decades now, and many ideas and visions have been put forward. I believe that these issues are all capable of being resolved, within the two year timeframe set out by President Obama, if the parties are genuinely willing to find solutions.</P><Col N="867"/>
        <P>We are all very well aware of the mutual distrust and lack of confidence on the part of both the parties that the other is genuinely serious. We are also aware of and concerned by the possibilities of events on the ground derailing the process, intentionally or otherwise. The Irish Government strongly supports the EU, President Obama and the Quartet in their efforts to urge all parties to engage seriously, to refrain from negative acts on the ground, to be mindful of the needs of the other protagonists, and to do all in their power to achieve a final settlement of this destructive conflict.</P>
        <P>The process initially involves Israel and the Palestinian President but in due course, if progress allows, the wider issues of Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and general Israeli-Arab relations will need to be addressed as well to reach the comprehensive solution that we all seek.</P>
        <P>In parallel with the pursuit of a comprehensive solution (through the proximity talks and, in due course, direct negotiations), Ireland, with our EU partners, on our own behalf and at the UN, will also remain focussed on the key human rights and justice issues which continue to effect the daily lives of the people of Gaza and the other Occupied Territories.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation in Zimbabwe continues to be of great concern to the Government and to the European Union as a whole. I am particularly concerned by reports of continuing human rights violations, arbitrary arrests, torture of prisoners and abuse of the rule of law. Our Embassy to Zimbabwe, which is based in Pretoria, regularly raises our concerns over violations of human rights and the rule of law with the Zimbabwean authorities. It is regrettable that, notwithstanding the welcome improvements in the economic sphere in Zimbabwe since the formation of the unity government, the day-to-day lives of many Zimbabweans are filled with insecurity. </P>
        <P>In terms of finding a way forward on these issues, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s neighbours have a critical role to play in encouraging reform, and can bring the greatest influence to bear in achieving progress in implementing the power sharing agreement, the Global Political Agreement (GPA). In that regard, Ireland with our EU partners welcomed the summit last November of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the guarantors of the GPA, which committed both parties in the unity government to enter talks on the full implementation of the GPA. That said, the lack of any real progress to date in those talks is worrying.</P>
        <P>I am all the more concerned given the call this week by Prime Minister Tsvangirai for an emergency SADC summit to resolve outstanding issues in the talks and prevent Zimbabwe from sliding back into greater political and economic instability. The outstanding issues include the appointment as Deputy Minister for Agriculture of Roy Bennett, who, it is to be noted, was acquitted of arms related charges by a Zimbabwe court on 10 May; the re-appointment of Attorney General Johannes Tomana; the stalled installation of provincial governors; and the unilateral alteration of ministerial mandates. With our partners in the EU, we urge the parties involved to redouble their efforts to find solutions to these issues.</P>
        <P>Regrettably, political dialogue between the EU and Zimbabwe has stalled. The EU has repeatedly stated its willingness to re-engage with the Zimbabwean Government. Re-engagement, however, remains conditional on a willingness to pursue in good faiththe agreed goals set out in the GPA. These include restoration of the rule of law, commitment to the democratic process and respect for human rights. We will continue to monitor the situation and press all members of the inclusive government to fulfil these obligations.</P><Col N="868"/>
        <P>In the meantime, Ireland has worked closely with our EU partners in developing a consistent approach to Zimbabwe that benefits the people of Zimbabwe, while maintaining pressure on the Government to reform. In keeping with other international donors, we do not provide funding to the Zimbabwean Government but respond to the humanitarian needs of the Zimbabwean people through support for the work of multilateral and non-governmental organisations. In 2008, total funding allocated to Zimbabwe under the aid programme amounted to &euro;10.82 million. In 2009, this figure was &euro;5.63 million. I am not in a position at this stage to specify the total amount of funding which will be allocated for Zimbabwe during 2010. However, so far this year the Government has allocated &euro;0.85 million for the humanitarian operations of a number of non-governmental organisations operating in Zimbabwe and a further &euro;1.5 million to support HIV and AIDS programmes in the country.</P>
        <P>It is vital for the future of Zimbabwe that the unity government delivers on the promise of reform, and secures for Zimbabwe&rsquo;s people real political freedoms, a return to the rule of law and economic development. Ireland will continue to work with our partners in the international community to encourage progress in these areas.</P>

	<P>As has been reported in this House on many previous occasions, and most recently on 5 May, human rights issues in China, including issues relating to Falun Gong, are regularly discussed on a bilateral basis with the Chinese Government, both in Beijing and in Dublin. The Government continues to stress at such meetings the great importance attached by Ireland to human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, and to urge the Chinese authorities to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Such detailed discussion on human rights issues took place at political consultations between Ireland and China in Beijing on 8 April. </P>
        <P>Human rights issues are also a constant and important point of dialogue for the European Union with the Chinese authorities, through the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue. This broad-ranging dialogue has allowed the EU to engage with China on issues <Col N="869"/>such as freedom of expression, the death penalty, the independence of the judiciary, prison conditions, freedom of religion and minority rights. The last session of the Dialogue took place on 20 November last, also in Beijing. A date for the next session has not yet been set.</P>
        <P>The Government remains deeply concerned about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China and questions in this regard &mdash; including specific cases &mdash; are raised with the Chinese authorities, both within the context of our own discussions with them and through the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue.</P>
        <P>We have taken very seriously allegations which have been made in the past claiming that live organs have been harvested from Falun Gong practitioners in detention. Extensive inquiries on this issue were made by my Department within the EU and UN frameworks in 2006/7, as well as through our Embassy in Beijing and with a variety of human rights organisations. Inquiries were also addressed to the Chinese authorities. At that time, we failed to identify sufficient reliable and independent evidence to substantiate the allegations, but the matter has been kept under review.</P>
        <P>The most recent allegations to which the Deputy refers relate to the alleged execution of prisoners, including Falun Gong practitioners, Tibetans, Christians and Uighurs and the harvesting of their organs for sale. These are allegations of the most serious kind and I have instructed officials of my Department to try to establish whether or not they can be substantiated.</P>
        <P>Developing the relationship between the EU and China is an important priority for the European Union and China is regularly discussed at meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council. Although human rights issues feature in such discussions in general terms, it is not customary to consider individual cases in that context. In the circumstances, I have instructed my Department to raise the issue at EU level, to liaise with EU Member States in investigating the allegations, and to seek a response from the Chinese authorities.</P>

	<P>Angola&rsquo;s first parliamentary election since 1992 took place in September 2008. The ruling MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) party won a landslide majority, with 82% of votes and a total of 191 seats out of 220. The main opposition party UNITA (the National Union for the Independence of Angola) had held 70 seats but retained only 16. </P>
        <P>An EU election observation mission said that the elections represented a &lsquo;positive step towards strengthening democracy&rsquo;, despite organisational weaknesses and the state&rsquo;s control of the media. The EU mission did not, however, go so far as to describe the elections as free and fair.</P>
        <P>The 2008 elections, even though they were not perfect, represented an important milestone for Angola on the democratic path. Turnout was estimated at over 75%, which was a demonstration of the Angolan people&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the democratic process. The elections passed off peacefully, which is significant given that the results of the previous election in Angola in 1992 were violently disputed, leading to the re-intensification of the civil war.</P>
        <P>UNITA challenged electoral results in the capital Luanda, and four other parties challenged the distribution of seats, but the Constitutional Court rejected complaints due to lack of evidence. Following this ruling, all parties accepted the result of the election.</P><Col N="870"/>
        <P>The Embassy of Ireland in Maputo is accredited to Angola. Since 2008, Ireland has provided over &euro;4 million in assistance to Angola. This has included &euro;855,000 to support mine clearance efforts and to provide some assistance to the victims of land mines. In addition, over &euro;3.5 million has been provided to non-governmental and missionary organisations in support of their work in the areas of HIV&amp;AIDS, food security, accountable governance, land rights and advocacy. More than half of our EU partners have resident missions in Angola, and the EU remains fully engaged in order to support democratic participation in the next elections, which are scheduled for 2012.</P>

	<P>The Rapid Response Corps was established in 2007 to provide a body of highly skilled volunteers who could deploy at short notice to Irish Aid&rsquo;s humanitarian partner organisations. </P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs recently held a recruitment drive to increase the number of volunteers within the Corps. As a result 25 new members have been recruited, bringing to 155 the total number of Rapid Response Corps volunteers available to deploy to humanitarian emergencies overseas. The new recruits will participate in induction training later this month, including at the Defence Force&rsquo;s UN Training School in the Curragh.</P>
        <P>Rapid Response Corps volunteers typically have a highly-specialised expertise in areas such as logistics, telecommunications or engineering. They deploy at the request of Irish Aid, acting on its own behalf or on behalf of its humanitarian partners. Since the Corps was established, 77 volunteers have deployed to over 20 countries, including at present to Afghanistan, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Iraq, Kenya, Somalia and Sudan.</P>

	<P>The success of the Global Irish Economic Forum held in September 2009 has had a transformative impact on Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with leading members of the Irish Diaspora.</P>
        <P>Extensive efforts have been taken by my Department, other Departments, the State Agencies and the private sector to advance the various initiatives that emerged from its deliberations and to further enhance the practical connections between the Irish at home and abroad.</P>
        <P>The follow-up process has been overseen by an inter-Departmental Committee of senior officials which was established last November. In March, a detailed six month Progress Report was published which contains specific updates in respect of a wide range of initiatives that have been taken since the Forum in areas as diverse as innovation; greentech; Diaspora engagement; culture, financial services; tourism, energy and food. As part of this follow up process, the Government has also provided funding of $3.4 million for a landmark Irish Arts Centre in New York and over $250,000 for the Irish Technology Leadership Group in Silicon Valley. Significant progress has also been made in the private sector towards the establishment of the Farmleigh Overseas Graduate Programme.</P><Col N="871"/>
        <P>Evidence of the significant impact made by the Forum is not confined to the Progress Report. The broad economic policies that were advocated by many participants were reflected significantly in Budget 2010. The Farmleigh follow-up process has also assisted other work underway across Government, including the implementation of the <i>Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy </i>strategy and the recommendations of the Innovation Task Force.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the new Global Irish Network in February provides an important mechanism for building on the work begun at Farmleigh. The Network includes some of the most influential Irish and Irish-connected individuals abroad and provides Ireland with an invaluable resource of international expertise from which we can draw as we work towards our economic recovery. I am convinced that this direct access to key private-sector decision makers across the globe has the potential to deliver real, tangible economic benefits for the Irish at home and abroad.</P>
        <P>Meetings of the Network have already been held this year in London, Paris, Germany, and the UAE, with further meetings planned later in the year for Shanghai and New York. Participants at these meetings have all underlined the galvanising effect the Global Irish Economic Forum has had on the leading members of our Diaspora. They have also stressed that, taken together with the difficult but necessary corrective steps the Government has taken to address our financial situation, the Network and the Forum have helped instil a greater sense of belief and optimism abroad that Ireland can overcome the current economic challenges. Network members have also reiterated the importance of Irish culture in the promotion of Ireland throughout the world.</P>
        <P>More broadly, I believe that since the Forum a new and more widespread acceptance has emerged throughout the public and private sectors of the potential that exists within the relationship between Ireland and its Diaspora. The Government is determined to maximise this opportunity through the Global Irish Network and the ongoing work of the Emigrant Support Programme. I believe that the Network should be regarded not just as an instrument of Government, but as a valuable national asset. I am therefore keen to work with members of the Opposition, the business community and other key stakeholders in order to ensure that its full potential is utilised.</P>

        <Quest>  if his attention has been drawn to the delay in processing passport applications and the disruption to the general public as a result; if special arrangements will be availed in case of emergencies in order that persons will be able to travel abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

	<P>As a direct result of ongoing industrial action by the Civil Public and Services Union (CPSU), significant arrears of passport applications have arisen within the Passport Service. There are currently approximately 66,000 passport applications waiting to be processed within the system and it is presently taking up to twenty-two working days to process individual applications. Applications, other than those that are prioritised on the basis of demonstrable urgent humanitarian need, are being processed on a first come first served basis. </P>
        <P>The dispute is having a severe impact on the travelling public. There are very many Irish citizens whose trips abroad have had to be cancelled and holiday and work plans severely disrupted.</P>
        <P>Every effort is being made to reduce the waiting time for applications, pending the resolution of the industrial action which is preventing the recruitment of temporary staff to address the <Col N="872"/>seasonal surge in demand for passports. Staff have been working overtime for some weeks and this has kept the level of increase in the backlog to a minimum and in recent days seen a marginal reduction in this level.</P>
        <P>However, the backlog in passport applications can and will be overcome when the CPSU call off their industrial action and co-operate with the recruitment of temporary staff normally engaged at this time of year. My Department has obtained the necessary sanction to recruit the temporary staff and arrangements have been made for staff to commence work at short notice. I would once again call on the CPSU to withdraw this restriction and to allow a significant number of currently unemployed workers to take on paid employment and assist in reducing the sizeable backlog of passport applications.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s current advice to passport applicants is available on the website<?oasys _jy ?>www.passport.ie :</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>1.  <?oasys _ix ?>Before making any overseas travel plans, customers should check passport expiry dates and submit any applications in sufficient time before the intended date of travel.</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>2.  <?oasys _ix ?>Photocopy the photograph page of any existing passport being renewed, include with the application form and retain the existing passport.</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>3.  <?oasys _ix ?>The recommended method for submitting passport applications is via the Passport Express service or the Northern Ireland Passport Express Service service, available through local post offices.</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>4.  <?oasys _ix ?>Applications submitted through this service are currently being processed up to 22 working days from the date of receipt.

<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>7.  <?oasys _ix ?>All other applications should be submitted through the Passport Express channel.</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p4- ?>8.  <?oasys _ix ?>Customers should retain the barcode number on their passport application and use this number to check the status of their application on the Passport Service website: www.passport.ie .

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 50 together. </P>
        <P>The situation in Somalia is of extreme concern, as the country has been without an effective government since 1991. The UN-backed Transitional Federal Government (TFG) faces enormous challenges, not least the fact that it controls little of the country&rsquo;s territory and that significant armed groups remained opposed to the President. In the north-west of the country, an independent republic of Somaliland has been proclaimed, while in the north-east Puntland has declared itself an autonomous state within Somalia. Both these areas, whose statehood is not recognised by the international community, enjoy relative stability compared to the south of the country, where the TGF is under attack from rebel groups, the most aggressive of which is Harakat al-Shabaab Mujahideen.</P>
        <P>The continuous instability and conflict, and deepening drought, have caused a huge humanitarian crisis. It is currently estimated that 3.2 million Somalis are in need of livelihood and humanitarian support. The long-standing absence of authority in the country has also led to Somali pirates becoming a major threat to international shipping in the area.</P>
        <P>In December 2008 the EU deployed the first ever ESDP naval mission, Operation Atalanta, with a mandate from the UN Security Council to contribute to the prevention, deterrence and repression of acts of piracy. It has been effective in delivering upon its mandate, protecting World Food Programme shipments of food aid to Somalia and reducing the incidence of pirate attacks against shipping in the region.</P>
        <P>However, it is commonly recognised that it is necessary to complement the work of Operation Atalanta by addressing the root causes of piracy which originate in the lawlessness plaguing the country. To this end, the EU has launched a military mission to train the Somali Security Forces and thereby assist the TFG in its efforts to begin to re-establish governance and the rule of law in the country. The EU Training Mission (EUTM), which started training members of the Somali security forces at the start of May, is taking place in Uganda and is scheduled to last for approximately one year. Ireland has seconded five members of the Permanent Defence Forces for service with the EU military training mission.</P>
        <P>The EU military training mission forms one part of a comprehensive approach conducted by the EU in the Horn of Africa to address the Somali crisis. The EU is also exploring possible action to support the Somali police and support maritime capacity development in Somalia and the region. Furthermore, the EU strongly supports the UN-facilitated Djibouti peace and reconciliation process and offers extensive humanitarian and development assistance to the Somali population.</P>
        <P>Since 2008, Ireland has provided over &euro;13.5 million in assistance to Somalia. This includes more than &euro;11.5 million in humanitarian assistance, which has focused on providing food to people affected by drought conditions, as well as those forced from their homes by violence, and has been provided through a variety of UN and NGO partners. In addition, Ireland has allocated over &euro;2 million in funding to Concern and World Vision Ireland for their programmes in Somalia, which focus on ensuring access to clean water and sanitation, supporting children worst affected by the conflict, health, and education.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, the insecurity and piracy problems, the poverty and the humanitarian crisis which affect Somalis are consequences of the fact that Somalia continues to fail as a state. The only long-term solution is the restoration of effective government, the gradual building up of adequate justice and policing systems, and the restoration of a functioning economy. Such <Col N="874"/>conditions cannot be enforced from outside, the Somali people themselves must find a solution. Ireland, with our partners in the EU, will continue to support efforts within Somalia to restore peace and stability to the country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 55 and 65 together.</P>
        <P>The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted by Heads of Government at the Millennium Summit in 2000 provide the framework for international development up to 2015. They set specific, measurable development targets and represent the commitment of the international community to work for the eradication of global poverty in all its forms.</P>
        <P>Progress on the MDGs will be reviewed at a UN Summit in New York in September. I believe it is essential that the Summit agrees a clear action plan, based on the evidence of the past ten years, to underpin work towards the achievement of the Goals. The Government has been working at the UN and with our EU partners to ensure that, working together, developed and developing countries can maintain their commitments to the world&rsquo;s poorest people in the face of increased global challenges and continuing international economic difficulty.</P>
        <P>Ireland has taken a lead internationally to focus attention at the Summit on the global hunger crisis. I have made the point strongly at meetings in Europe, Africa and the United States that slow progress on the first of the MDGs, the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, is not only a scandal in itself, it is impeding progress across the whole range of development goals. We are also arguing that priority be given to those regions and groups that are lagging behind, in particular those most vulnerable to extreme poverty and hunger in sub-Saharan Africa, which is the primary geographic focus of the Government&rsquo;s aid programme.</P>
        <P>Over the coming weeks, Ireland will play an important role in the preparation of a strong EU position for the Summit, which will be considered at a special meeting of Development Ministers, which I will attend, in preparation for the June European Council. Nationally, we are also preparing with the US Administration for the organisation of an Irish&ndash;US event during the New York Summit to promote a comprehensive international approach to the global hunger crisis. This will highlight the need to link agriculture, food security and nutrition programming in order to provide a realistic and sustainable solution to world hunger. I have just returned from a series of meetings in Washington and New York in preparation for this event and for our participation in the UN Summit.</P><Col N="875"/>
        <P>We are working closely with representatives of all parties as we prepare for the Summit, and I would recognise in particular the important role being played by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. It will strengthen our position internationally if we can demonstrate that Ireland&rsquo;s response to the Millennium Development Goals is a national one, reflecting views across the political and the non-governmental spectrum. At a recent roundtable meeting sponsored by Tr&oacute;caire, I invited Irish Aid&rsquo;s NGO partners to document their contribution to the achievement of the MDGs so that we can report on the full extent of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution over the past ten years and assess how we can work together to accelerate progress over the coming five. We have also proposed to D&oacute;chas, the umbrella organisation for the Irish development NGOs, that we work together to prepare positions reflecting our common concerns for the Summit in September.</P>

        <Quest> his views on Turkish membership of the EU; if he agrees that Turkish membership should not be considered until such time as Turkey withdraws from our fellow EU member State, Cyprus, and lifts all its restrictions on trade, airflight and shipping and so on in relation to Cyprus. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Union has a long and close relationship with Turkey.  Accession negotiations were opened in 2005 and Ireland makes a constructive input to those negotiations.  As a beneficiary of a past enlargement, and on the experience of more recent accessions, Ireland is generally supportive of enlargement.  Enlargement bolsters economic and political reform processes and helps to promote stability, security and prosperity in Europe.  It is subject to rigorous conditionality and should take account of the capacity of the EU to integrate new members. Enlargement is a negotiated process and, as in any negotiation, the eventual outcome and timeframe cannot be predicted.</P>
        <P>These factors shape Ireland&rsquo;s supportive approach to Turkey&rsquo;s candidacy. There are, in addition, potential gains to the single market and to trade through the accession of a country of Turkey&rsquo;s size.  The Union&rsquo;s reach and influence in the Middle East and Central Asia could be enhanced through Turkish accession.</P><Col N="876"/>
        <P>Turkey still has substantial work ahead in meeting the established criteria and conditions for membership.  I met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in Dublin on 10 March 2010.  In the course of that meeting, Minister Davutoglu outlined the progress Turkey has made on reforms in a number of areas as it has sought to bring Turkey more in line with the EU <i>acquis</i>.  He explained how the accession negotiations provide a strong incentive for Turkey to pursue reforms, strengthen democracy and human rights and further modernise the country. While much has been achieved in Turkey in these areas, the challenge is now for Turkey to maintain and accelerate the progress on reforms.</P>
        <P>I reiterated to Minister Davutoglu Ireland&rsquo;s support for the Turkish candidacy.  At the same time, I noted the Council&rsquo;s deep regret at Turkey&rsquo;s continued non-compliance with its obligations under the Ankara Protocol by continuing to refuse to open its ports and airports to vessels and aircraft from the Republic of Cyprus. The Council will not permit eight chapters of the accession framework to be opened and no further chapters to be provisionally closed until Turkey fulfils its commitments in this regard.</P>
        <P>I also highlighted the need for Turkey to make progress towards normalisation of its relations with the Republic of Cyprus. In line with successive European Council conclusions, Ireland expects that, as emphasised by the Negotiating Framework, Turkey should actively support the ongoing negotiations aimed at a fair, comprehensive and viable settlement of the Cyprus problem within the UN framework, in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and in line with the principles on which the Union is founded.</P>

	<P>Rockall is a small uninhabitable rock, 25 x 30 metres wide, located approximately 160 nautical miles west of the Scottish islands of St. Kilda and 230 nautical miles to the north west of Donegal.  It marks a point at which the Rockall Bank, part of the very large Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf extending under the north-east Atlantic Ocean, protrudes 21 metres above sea level. During the 1960s and 1970s the issue of Rockall was a source of legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The United Kingdom claims sovereignty over Rockall and has sought to formally annex it under the Island of Rockall Act 1972.</P>
        <P>While Ireland has not recognised British sovereignty over Rockall, it has never sought to claim sovereignty for itself.  The consistent position of successive Irish Governments has been that Rockall and similar rocks and skerries have no significance for establishing legal claims to mineral rights in the adjacent seabed and to fishing rights in the surrounding seas.</P>
        <P>During the course of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which took place from 1973 to 1982, Ireland worked hard to achieve agreement on this principle.  The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was adopted at the conclusion of the Conference on 10 December 1982, provides at Article 121, paragraph 3 that: &ldquo;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.&rdquo; Rockall falls into precisely this category.</P>
        <P>I am aware from newspaper reports that an individual intends to attempt to place a plaque on the rock in the near future.  Since activity of this nature has no effect on the British claim <Col N="877"/>to sovereignty over Rockall and has no significance in international law in relation to the status of the rock, I do not propose to take any action in relation to it.</P>
        <P>In 1988, Ireland and the UK reached agreement on the delimitation of areas of the continental shelf between the two countries, stretching out up to 500 nautical miles from their respective coastlines.  This included the division of the Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf on which Rockall is situated, although under the terms of the Law of the Sea Convention the location of Rockall was irrelevant to the determination of the boundary. According to that determination, Rockall is situated to the north of the boundary agreed with the UK in 1988 and lies outside the zone claimed by Ireland.</P>
        <P>As with any claim to continental shelf lying beyond 200 nautical miles from shore, the UN Convention requires that Ireland and the UK submit their claims for examination to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. However, the claims to the Hatton-Rockall shelf agreed between Ireland and the UK are not accepted by Iceland or the F&aelig;roe Islands, which make their own claims.  The four sides have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the overlapping claims issue but to date have been unable to reach agreement.  In view of the 10-year deadline for the making of submissions to the UN Commission &mdash; which for Ireland expired last May &mdash; Ireland lodged its national claim for this area in March 2009.  While the Commission&rsquo;s rules of procedure prevent consideration of the submission without the consent of all the states concerned, its lodgement at this time stops the clock on the deadline and preserves Ireland&rsquo;s legal position.  In the meantime, the four sides intend to keep the matter under regular review and we will continue to work for the creation of conditions that will permit consideration of the submission by the Commission as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The State&rsquo;s continental shelf has already been successfully extended beyond 200 nautical miles in the area to the west of the Porcupine Bank.  Together with France, Spain and the UK, we have also successfully extended it in the area of the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 49 together.</P>
        <P>EU relations with Colombia are conducted in the framework of regional relations between the EU and the Andean Community, comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.  In 2007, negotiations aimed at concluding a comprehensive Association Agreement between the EU and the Andean Community were formally launched.  Such Agreements cover all facets of relations between the EU and these countries, including political dialogue, economic cooperation and trade.  However, as not all member states of the Andean Community were in a position to proceed with free trade negotiations, the decision was taken to commence negotiations on a multiparty Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and two member states of the Andean Community &mdash; Colombia and Peru &mdash; within the overall framework of the Association Agreement.  The negotiations were carried out by the European Commission on the basis of a mandate from the Council.  The conclusion of the negotiations was acknowledged <Col N="878"/>by Heads of State and Government at the EU- Latin America and Caribbean Summit in Madrid this week.</P>
        <P>There is no single solution for promoting peace in Colombia; the various social and economic elements underlying the conflict have to be tackled simultaneously.  Our approach and that of the EU is to assist and influence the Colombian Government in a manner that results in economic and social development while progressively improving human rights standards.  For this reason the conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Colombia will contribute significantly to the social and economic development of Colombia, which is imperative if it is to emerge from its violent past.</P>
        <P>I am aware of and share the deep concern that has been expressed at the manner in which trade union activists, human rights defenders and journalists have been treated in Colombia.  I wish to assure the Deputy that there is no question of strengthening economic ties with Colombia at the expense of human rights.  I am of the view that concluding the FTA negotiations with Colombia at this time offers the best opportunity to ensure that the concerns of EU Member States at the human rights situation in that country and, in particular, the treatment of trade union activists are fully addressed by the Colombian government<b><i>.</i></b></P>
        <P>I have previously put on record the various steps which Ireland has taken over the past year to address human rights issues directly with the Government of Colombia and together with the European Union.  As a result, the Colombian authorities have been left in no doubt about the seriousness of our concerns regarding the human rights situation and the extent of the improvements needed. I can assure you that the Government will continue to closely follow the human rights situation in Colombia and take the steps we consider necessary bilaterally as well as in cooperation with our EU partners.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, there was no support among Member States for the idea of suspending even one round of negotiations with Colombia, much less the Agreement as a whole.  We therefore concentrated our efforts on working with like-minded Member States to ensure that the Agreement will result in further scrutiny of the Colombian labour market, thereby benefiting trade unionists, among others.  I am very satisfied that at Ireland&rsquo;s insistence, the Agreement includes a clause committing both EU Member States and Colombia to the implementation of their human rights responsibilities.</P>
        <P>EU relations with Honduras are conducted within the framework of the EU-Central America Dialogue, which was launched in 1984 and includes involves Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama and Nicaragua, and which forms the cornerstone of EU-Central American relations.</P>
        <P>Like Colombia, Honduras faces many challenges.  Elections took place in November 2009 against the backdrop of a military coup.  While the electoral process took place under abnormal circumstances, Ireland and the EU viewed the elections as a significant step forward in solving the crisis in Honduras. President Lobo took a number of encouraging steps in advance of his inauguration in January 2010, including the signature of the <i>Accord for National Reconciliation and for the Strengthening of Democracy in Honduras</i> and he formed a Government of National Unity. On 4 May, the Honduran Government inaugurated a Truth Commission chaired by former Guatemalan Vice President Eduardo Stein.  The EU remains committed to lend its support to the re-establishment of constitutional and democratic order and to the process of national reconciliation in Honduras.</P>
        <P>Against this backdrop, the Irish and EU approach is to assist and influence the Honduran Government in a manner that promotes economic and social development while progressively improving human rights standards.  The conclusion of an Association Agreement between the <Col N="879"/>EU and Central America will contribute significantly to the social and economic development of the region and will help to underpin progress in Honduras.</P>
        <P>Summit leaders at the EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit in Madrid this week expressed their satisfaction with the conclusion of the negotiations on the Association Agreement.  The Agreement includes numerous references to the importance of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.  It provides for political dialogue between Central America and the EU and this dialogue is designed to pave the way for new initiatives to promote and protect rights and fundamental freedoms, including those of indigenous peoples and migrants.  Both sides agree to the reinforcement of democratic institutions, good governance, full applicability of the rule of law, promotion and respect for human rights.  They also will give priority to the alleviation of poverty, inequality and social exclusion.</P>
        <P>As in the case of Colombia, I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to closely follow the human rights situation in Honduras and other Central American states and take the steps we consider necessary bilaterally as well as in cooperation with our EU partners.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 165 together.</P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs provides travel advice to Irish citizens wishing to visit Thailand thought its website.  The current advice can be found at <i>www.dfa.ie</i>.  There are two Irish Honorary Consulates in Thailand, one in Bangkok and the other in Phuket which provide consular assistance to Irish citizens in that country.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s travel advice is regularly updated and is designed to help Irish citizens make informed decisions before travelling overseas.  It reflects a considered assessment of the risks involved and is based on the best information available to the Department.  It draws on reports from Irish Diplomatic and Consular Missions abroad, and in the case of Thailand both our Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, which is accredited to Thailand, and the two Irish Consulates.  It also reflects advice issued by other countries including Member States of the European Union, as well as other like minded countries.  Every effort is made to ensure that the advice offered is accurate and up-to-date, particularly in a quickly changing environment.</P>
        <P>The Department is currently advising against all but essential travel to Thailand and Irish citizens intending to travel are strongly encouraged to consider whether their presence in that country is absolutely necessary.  However, the advice does not apply to passengers simply intending to transit Bangkok airport en-route to other destinations outside Thailand.  The advice takes account of the current security situation that has existed since 7 April when a State of Emergency was declared in Bangkok and surrounding provinces.</P>
        <P>Irish citizens residing in or intending to travel to Thailand are strongly advised to register their contact details with the Department through the voluntary on-line registration facility and these details can be used to make direct contact in the event that the situation deteriorates even further.  Also, Irish citizens currently in Thailand should keep well informed of the developing situation on the ground, remain indoors should violence break out close to where <Col N="880"/>they are staying, avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, avoid visiting Government agencies and avoid travelling to or through central Bangkok.  If Irish citizens require assistance locally while in Thailand they can also contact the Irish Honorary Consuls in Bangkok and Phuket.</P>
        <P>Ireland works closely with other Member States of the European Union in ensuring effective coordination of crisis plans and on the sharing and exchange of information on how to act together to assist all our nationals.  To this end we hold regular teleconferences to share effectively all essential information and to coordinate any joint action that is necessary.  I can assure the Deputies that the Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to monitor the situation closely and will remain in regular contact with the Thai authorities and other EU Member States.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 58 together.</P>
        <P>Following the recent British elections and the agreement between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrat Party on the formation of a Coalition Government, Conservative leader David Cameron was appointed Prime Minister on Tuesday 11 May and the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister on Wednesday 12 May, with all remaining Government appointments being made on Thursday 13 May.</P>
        <P>The Coalition Agreement, which was published on Wednesday 12 May, includes a section entitled &ldquo;Relations with the EU&rdquo; which begins with a statement that the two parties &ldquo;agree that the British Government will be a positive participant in the European Union, playing a strong and positive role with our partners, with the goal of ensuring that all the nations of Europe are equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century: global competitiveness, global warming and global poverty.&rdquo;  This section of the document proceeds to set out a series of agreements between the two parties on more specific issues.</P>
        <P>I spoke last week with the new Foreign Secretary, William Hague, to offer my congratulations on his appointment.  I took the opportunity to recall our useful meeting during my visit to London last February.  I now look forward to developing a close working relationship with Mr. Hague within the EU Council framework as our two countries address together the EU agenda and the full gamut of international issues.  I had arranged a short bilateral meeting with Mr. Hague on Monday, in the margins of the EU-Latin America and Caribbean summit in Madrid.  Unfortunately, air travel restrictions due to volcanic ash prevented me from travelling to Madrid.  Contacts are underway to arrange an alternative meeting at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>I note that the Foreign Secretary has had an opinion piece published in Monday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Times</i>.  Without going into all the detail, his description of the accomplishments of the Union over the past 20 years is certainly one I would agree with, as is his setting out of some of the main challenges on which we need to work together: combating climate change, fighting global poverty and securing our energy supplies.  I look forward to working with Mr. Hague on the <Col N="881"/>full range of EU issues, above all the EU response to the economic challenges which Europe is currently facing.</P>
        <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Hague&rsquo;s predecessor, David Miliband, who was appointed Foreign Secretary one month after I was appointed to this office.  During almost two years working together in the EU, at the UN and in many other international fora, we established a strong and productive relationship.</P>

	<P>Ireland and its EU partners oppose the death penalty in all circumstances, and make this position clear to all relevant authorities, including the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian law still provides for the death penalty in certain circumstances, but no execution may be carried out without the agreement of the President.  The withholding by President Abbas of his agreement to carry out executions has therefore resulted in a <i>de facto</i> moratorium on executions, pending its hoped-for final abolition.</P>
        <P>The execution of the two individuals concerned by the Hamas authorities in Gaza on 15 April was thus without basis in Palestinian law.  The EU representatives to the Palestinian Authority condemned the executions in a statement issued by the local Spanish Presidency.  Regrettably, I have to report that there is information that three more prisoners, who had been sentenced to death for murder, were executed in Gaza on Tuesday morning.  There are also unconfirmed reports that there may have been earlier executions by Hamas which have not come to light.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 160 together.</P>
        <P>Addressing HIV and AIDS, which has destroyed the lives of millions of men, women and children, is of fundamental importance to the reduction of global poverty.  AIDS remains a leading cause of death in many developing countries. Over 22 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with HIV.</P>
        <P>The Government has committed to expend &euro;100 million each year on HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases.  This year, under the aid programme managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Government will spend approximately &euro;105 million in combating HIV and AIDS and communicable diseases, a reduction of &euro;9 million in funding from 2009.  The fact that we are expending a very significant amount of money, especially in the current economic environment, clearly illustrates the seriousness of our commitment to tackle HIV and AIDS and communicable diseases, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa where our programme is focussed.</P>
        <P>Over &euro;42 million will be spent on HIV, AIDS and communicable diseases through our development programmes in those countries most affected by the pandemic.  This represents a &euro;5 million reduction from last year&rsquo;s spend.  Most of this reduction is as a result of a process of division of labour undertaken collectively by donors aimed at increasing effectiveness and impact of overall donor support.  This joint exercise has resulted in us exiting gradually from the health sector in Zambia and Uganda where other donors are leading on health issues.</P>
        <P>We place a strong emphasis on ensuring that international best practice informs policy and programming through our funding for key global partnerships and critical research areas, including the development of new products to prevent HIV transmission.  A total of &euro;21 million will be allocated to Global Health and AIDS initiatives this year. This includes support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.  We will continue to support a regional AIDS programme in southern and eastern Africa, although overall expenditure to this programme will be reduced by about &euro;1 million as contracts with some partner organisations are expiring.  A review of this programme was undertaken recently and this review will inform our future programme in the region.</P>
        <P>An estimated &euro;9 million will be provided to assist United Nations programmes in targeting AIDS and communicable diseases at national level, representing a cut of about &euro;1 million on last year&rsquo;s spend.  It is anticipated that increased efficiencies in UN systems and programmes will absorb most of this reduction.   We recognise that AIDS and communicable diseases have a particularly devastating impact in humanitarian emergency and recovery situations.  In 2010 an estimated &euro;9 million will be spent on efforts to address these diseases in such settings.  This will include support to frontline work in the fragile states of Sierra Leone and Liberia.</P>
        <P>There will be approximately &euro;24 million allocated to support the work of civil society partners in dealing with HIV, AIDS and communicable diseases.  The valuable work of these organisations includes vital community-level support which complements other Irish Aid assistance, and their dependence on Irish Aid funding has meant that their allocations have been relatively protected.  Recent data from the UNAIDS World Report for 2008 demonstrates that both global HIV prevalence and death rates peaked in 2004, and are now declining.  However, the number of people living with HIV continues to increase.</P>
        <P>The UNAIDS Report describes a remarkable boost in delivery of important HIV and AIDS services and activities at global, regional and country levels.  More than 4 million people are now on effective anti-retroviral treatment.  This is an enormous achievement in a relatively short period of time and Ireland has played, and continues to play, an important role in this progress.  Outstanding features of the increase in resources mobilised by the international com<Col N="883"/>munity include the presence of private philanthropic donors and the unprecedented number of civil society groups that have become active in HIV and AIDS work. These groups have joined hands with their government counterparts and with international donors, including Ireland, to more effectively tackle HIV and AIDS through partnership.</P>
        <P>Success in a number of African countries offers hope that, with international support, it will be possible to get ahead of this infection.  In Mozambique for example, where Ireland partners effectively with the Clinton Foundation, over 173,000 people are now on HIV treatment, up from less than 2,000 people at the end of 2002.  These gains represent major steps to overcome AIDS.  However the disease continues to spread.  For every two persons put on treatment five others become newly infected.  There is a need to improve prevention and develop new prevention tools.  The international community&rsquo;s response needs to be sustained while realigning to this reality and Ireland will continue to play a significant role both globally and at country level in this regard.  My Department will ensure that Government support for actions to combat HIV, AIDS and communicable diseases will continue to prioritise those most affected by the pandemic.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The practice of female genital mutilation is a clear violation of the human rights of women and girls.  It has serious social, health and psychological consequences, and it infringes on children&rsquo;s rights to special protection.  The World Health Organisation estimates that between 100 million and 140 million girls and women worldwide are currently living with the consequences of female genital mutilation.  In Africa alone, it is estimated that three million girls are at risk annually.</P>
        <P>The Government is active in global policy development, funding and research to address this appalling practice.  We recognise that it is a form of gender-based violence, and that it must be an important element in our comprehensive approach to tackling such violence, through the overseas aid programme.  The Government&rsquo;s 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid includes a firm commitment that Ireland will build its support for measures focused on preventing and responding to gender-based violence.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid, the Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs which manages the Government&rsquo;s aid programme, is a founding member of the Joint Consortium on Gender Based Violence, which brings together representatives from Government Departments and Irish development, humanitarian and human rights Non-Governmental Organisations to promote a coordinated response to all forms of gender-based violence, including female genital mutilation.</P>
        <P>Internationally, we are cooperating with United Nations agencies in a concerted effort to end the practice of female genital mutilation.  Last year, the Government provided core funding of &euro;8 million to the United Nations Fund for Children (UNICEF) and &euro;3 million to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to support their work on child protection, gender equality, reproductive health, maternal mortality and HIV and AIDS.  These agencies operate a joint programme to counter female genital mutilation with the aim of ending the practice in seventeen countries by 2012.  Ireland contributed &euro;0.5 million to this specific programme in 2007.

        <P>Progress is being made towards ending the practice of female genital mutilation, but detailed international coordination and consultation remains essential.  On 6 February 2010, which is designated International Day Against Female Genital Mutilation, UNICEF and the UNFPA reported that there has been success in reducing the incidence of the practices in several countries where it was once prevalent.  They noted that it is important to focus on encouraging change from within societies, and that where communities have chosen to make public declarations against the practice, for example in Senegal, declines of up to 65 per cent have been recorded.</P>

	<P>For 2010, the Government has provided an overall allocation for Official Development Assistance (ODA) of &euro;671 million.  Of this total, &euro;536 million will be administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and a further estimated &euro;135 million will come from other Government Departments, together with Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation budget.  Based on current projections Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure on ODA will amount to approximately 0.52% of GNP in 2010.  This level of funding confirms that Ireland remains one of the most generous donors internationally on a per capita basis.</P>
        <P>The EU has committed to meeting the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP by 2015.  Following the budget last December, the Government committed Ireland to meeting the UN target by 2015, thereby aligning us with our fellow EU Member States. It is important to note that Ireland remains ahead of most Member States in progress towards the 2015 target and that we will exceed the interim target set by the EU of spending at least 0.51% of GNP on ODA in 2010.  As we move towards 2015, the Government will make every effort, subject to the need to stabilise our public finances, to progress to the 0.7% target.</P>

	<P>Combating hunger is a cornerstone of our development programme and our foreign policy. We have undertaken to direct approximately 20 per cent of the Irish Aid budget on hunger and hunger related actions by 2012. We are firmly on track to meet this target notwithstanding the current difficult economic circumstances. Ireland&rsquo;s leadership in this area is recognised internationally. We spent approximately &euro;85 million on hunger and hunger related areas in 2009 and expect to maintain a similar, or possibly slightly higher, level of spending in 2010.</P>
        <P>In framing the aid budget for 2010, I have at all times prioritised initiatives which tackle hunger and protect the world&rsquo;s poorest and most vulnerable. Significant resources are currently focussed on hunger reduction initiatives in our Programme Countries, in particular Malawi, Tanzania and Ethiopia. Through our support for agencies such as UNICEF we are targeting child malnutrition, and Irish humanitarian support continues to provide emergency food relief to those with the most urgent needs. In addition, Irish Aid funding for global hunger initiatives, including pro-poor agricultural research, is expected to reach approximately &euro;9.7m this year.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to giving effect to the recommendations of the Report of the Hunger Task Force which we commissioned and which was launched by the Taoiseach at the UN in New York in September 2008 in the presence of the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. In particular, we continue to work on the three priority areas identified, namely: increasing smallholder agricultural productivity in Africa; targeting under-nutrition, especially maternal and infant; and promoting governance and leadership action on tackling global hunger. We are making good progress in implementing the recommendations of the Report across the Irish Aid programme. Ireland&rsquo;s Special Envoy on Hunger, Kevin Farrell, will report on the progress that we and our partners are making towards the end of this year.</P>
        <P>Ireland is recognised on the international stage as being a strong leader and a credible partner in the fight against global hunger, and is a major global advocate on food security. Earlier this week we hosted, together with Concern and the UN, an important international conference on global hunger to encourage comprehensive action to tackle this scourge. Next September we will co-host with the US a major event on hunger and under-nutrition at the UN Summit on the Millennium Development Goals. This event will bring together world leaders to highlight the importance of eradicating global hunger and improving nutrition in the households of the most poor. These are practical examples of Ireland shaping and influencing the international response to the scandal of world hunger.</P>
        <P>Although global hunger, in all its manifestations and complexity, will not be easily eliminated, we can make it happen if the international community takes concerted action. We have a clear international target, the<b> </b>hunger target of the first Millennium Development Goal, to halve the number of hungry by 2015. The realisation of all of the other MDGs<b> </b>will be undermined if food, the most basic of all human needs, is not available or easily accessed by all. The Government will continue to ensure that Ireland plays its role in all efforts to eradicate the scourge of global hunger.</P>

	<P>The White Paper on Irish Aid sets out the principles and policies underlying the aid programme. It identifies the considerations which guide the selection of long term development partners. These include factors such as the level of poverty and the scope for Ireland to make a positive impact. It also includes standards of governance, stability and the potential of the partner government to take ownership of the country&rsquo;s development process. In addition countries receiving emergency assistance are assisted based on immediate needs and humanitarian principles. The concentration of Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance on a limited number of poor countries was seen as one of its main strengths by the OECD DAC in its 2009 Peer Review of Ireland. The Government is not considering the addition of a further programme country at this time.</P>
        <P>The Irish Aid Programme continues to have clear focus on reducing poverty in some of the poorest countries of the world through a number of different funding channels including through the United Nations, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and other agencies for development programmes and projects.</P>
        <P>Cuba has received assistance from the Irish Aid programme over the last number of years. In the aftermath of the series of devastating hurricanes which struck Cuba in 2008, Irish Aid provided emergency assistance of &euro;150,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross in support of the Cuban Red Cross. Other Irish Aid funding to alleviate poverty in Cuba has been channelled through international agencies such as the UN and Tr&oacute;caire.</P>
        <P>Cuba itself has a strong focus on providing development assistance through the provision of technical assistance in health and education. This includes health and medical staffing to a number of countries with which Ireland has an aid programme such as Timor Leste and Zambia. Cuba was also among the first to provide assistance to Haiti following the recent earthquake.</P>
        <P>While Cuba is included by the OECD in the list of countries where development funding can be considered as Official Development Assistance (ODA), it is classified as an upper middle income country.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware there is no legal requirement for Irish citizens to have a passport for travel from Ireland to Britain. The Common Travel Area is a passport-free zone between the two islands. The area&rsquo;s internal borders are subject to minimal or non-existent border controls and can normally be crossed by Irish and British citizens with only minimal identity documents. The maintenance of the area involves considerable co-operation on immigration matters between the British and the Irish authorities.</P><Col N="887"/>

Ryanair informed my Department that this is their policy for travel on all of their routes across Europe and that they will not be relaxing this policy. They said that they have received representations from other EU Member States in the past to change this requirement and that they had refused these requests and therefore will not change their policy for flights between Ireland and Britain.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 2002, the political situation in Chad has been dominated by threats of armed rebellion against the government of President Idriss D&eacute;by. While the government signed an accord with civilian opposition parties in 2007, providing for a degree of political reform, armed rebel groups had remained active and intent on overthrowing the government by force. In the past year, however, the Government&rsquo;s success in halting a rebel advance from the east of the country seems to confirm that the Chadian armed forces have achieved military superiority.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s financial and military advantage also suggests that a political change of leadership in Chad is unlikely in the immediate future. The ruling MPS party and the incumbent President D&eacute;by are expected to win in parliamentary and presidential elections which have been deferred respectively to November 2010 and April 2011 due to the slow pace of preparations.</P>
        <P>Instability in eastern Chad is closely linked to the conflict in neighbouring Darfur. Cooperation between the governments of Sudan and Chad in addressing the causes of instability in the region is therefore vital. Relations between the two countries traditionally have been volatile and Ireland and the EU therefore gave particular welcome to the re-establishment of diplomatic and military ties between the two countries last February.</P>
        <P>We will continue to monitor the political and humanitarian situation in Chad, and support humanitarian relief efforts, to which Ireland has contributed more than &euro;17 million since 2007. The focus of our assistance has been on helping people forced from their homes by violence. As well as funding provided to the United Nations for coordination and the provision of food, we have supported Irish NGOs running camps and providing emergency eye care to refugees. Ireland has also provided funding to non-governmental and missionary organisations for work in areas such as gender equality.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to peace and security in Chad has been exemplified through our participation, since 2008, in the EUFOR and MINURCAT peace keeping operations in that country. While the Government had expected and planned for our continued participation in MINURCAT, the Government of Chad earlier this year requested the UN to withdraw the operation&rsquo;s military component. Ireland consequently sought assurances from the UN regard<Col N="889"/>ing the future of the mission and the nature of its mandate. However, it has not been possible to obtain that clarity, and the Government has taken the difficult decision to withdraw the bulk of the Irish contingent from the operation.</P>
        <P>While discussions continue among the members of the Security Council on the mission&rsquo;s future, it is quite clear that its character will change significantly. Since it will no longer have the ability to ensure a safe and secure environment for refugees and displaced persons and to facilitate the free movement of humanitarian workers, NGOs and the UN, the Government sees little point in continuing our contribution to the mission. It is expected that MINURCAT will go non-operational in October and that the force will be finally withdrawn by the end of the year.</P>

The following is the present position insofar as it relates to Treaties on which my Department has lead responsibility.</P>
        <P>Two international agreements within the UN framework for which my Department holds lead responsibility have been signed, but not yet ratified, by Ireland. These agreements are:</P>
<P el="5">1. <?oasys _ix ?>The Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes, signed 18 April 1961;</P>
<P el="5">2. <?oasys _ix ?>The Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes, signed 24 April 1963.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Ratification of these agreements is linked to the wider question of the making of a declaration by Ireland accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. The full implications of making such a declaration, and the question of what, if any, conditions or reservations should attach to it, are complex matters which require careful study, including with the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above international agreements, inter-Departmental consultations on consideration of possible signature and ratification by Ireland of the Optional Protocol on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights are ongoing, with the Department of Foreign Affairs playing a lead co-ordination role.

	<P>Through the overseas aid programme the Government provides assistance to over ninety countries worldwide. Nine have been designated as Programme Countries for Irish Aid, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance. These are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Timor Leste, Uganda, Vietnam and Zambia.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid provided direct programme funding of &euro;198 million to our nine Programme Countries in 2009. This year, &euro;185 million is being provided. The breakdown by Programme Country is as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />In Ethiopia &euro;27.84 million was provided in 2009. The programme budget for 2010 is &euro;26.05 million.</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />In Malawi, &euro;8.88 million was provided in 2009. The programme budget for 2010 is &euro;8.33 million.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />In Mozambique, &euro;40.5 million was provided in 2009. The programme budget for 2010 is &euro;37.5 million.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />In Tanzania, &euro;33.5 million was provided in 2009. The programme budget in 2010 is &euro;31.3 million. </P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />In Timor Leste, &euro;3.42 million was provided in 2009. The programme budget for 2010 remains at this level.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />In Uganda, &euro;35.5 million was provided in 2009. The programme budget for 2010 is &euro;33.25 million.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />In Vietnam, &euro;13.75 million was provided in 2009. The programme budget for this year is &euro;12.75 million.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />In Zambia, &euro;23.21 million was provided in 2009. The programme budget for 2010 is &euro;21.65 million.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Government channels additional funding to the Programme Countries in response to emergencies and humanitarian disasters, as necessary. Significant funding is also provided each year for the activities and programmes of development Non-Governmental Organisations, and through contributions to UN and other international agencies. In the case of Timor Leste, additional funding is allocated for conflict resolution activities.</P>
        <P>In deciding on the 2010 budget allocations to the Programme Countries we have in all cases ensured that the continuity of our programmes will be maintained. In some cases, funding timeframes have been extended and disbursement rates modified, but the planned final outputs will be delivered. We will ensure that our overall commitments to our nine Programme Countries are met.</P>
        <P>I believe that the Irish people can be proud that, through Irish Aid, we are delivering an internationally-recognised aid programme which is sharply focused on the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger in some of the poorest countries, especially in Africa. I can assure the House that the high standards achieved by the programme will be maintained in 2010 and subsequent years.</P>

This was one of the issues which I discussed during my meeting with the Cuban Foreign Minister, Bruno Rodriguez Parilla, which took place yesterday.</P>

        <Quest> if he is concerned with the slow progress towards establishing equality for women, and in particular, their ability to own land in Zambia. </Quest>
        <QRef>[20945/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of ensuring equality for women is a challenge facing every country in the world to a greater or lesser extent. While the situation in Zambia is of serious concern, I am confident that it is moving in the right direction, albeit slowly. Ireland is active in the drive towards greater equality in Zambia though the work of Irish Aid there. Zambia is one of Irish Aid&rsquo;s programme countries and we will be providing &euro; 21.65 million in development assistance under that programme in 2010. In addition to that, we fund civil society and missionary organisations directly from Irish Aid headquarters. In 2009 nearly &euro;3 million was provided in this way.    I should point out that the Government of Zambia, with which we work closely, is committed to addressing gender inequality at all levels. </P>
        <P>The problem with gender inequality in Zambia is that it is culturally entrenched. In general, women and girls are regarded as subordinate to their male counterparts and tend not to fare as well as men in relation to the important indicators. Boys stay in school longer than girls; HIV prevalence is higher among women than men; and a greater proportion of female headed households are extremely poor. More than 50% of women have suffered physical, emotional or sexual violence.</P>
        <P>The difficulties faced by women in relation to land ownership in Zambia are both legal and cultural. Statutory law does allow women, whether single, married or divorced, to own and inherit land. However, culture and customary law favour male ownership, particularly in rural areas. Women are further disadvantaged in obtaining credit, largely because of the land ownership problem. More generally however, it should be noted that only about 12% of small scale farmers, whether male or female, have legal title to their land. This is due to the fact that procedures for acquiring land and title are cumbersome and bureaucratic.</P>
        <P>Gender equality is one of the cross-cutting priorities throughout the work of Irish Aid in all countries, and as such, permeates all our work, at every level. A few examples of this are that Ireland provides funds to the UN&rsquo;s Joint Gender Support Programme of the &lsquo;Gender in Development Division of Government&rsquo; in Zambia; Irish Aid advocates with the Zambian Ministry of Education, which has now contributed to the setting up of an equity advisory group to <Col N="892"/>address gender exclusion; and Irish Aid has supported training for 33 small and medium sized businesses for women entrepreneurs in collaboration with the Zambia Development Agency.</P>
        <P>For its part, the Government of Zambia has committed to address gender inequality at all levels and has made some significant progress at the institutional level. A national gender policy was introduced in 2000, which, among other things, aims at improving representation of women in decision making positions and for at least 30% of land allocations to go to women. A draft Anti-Domestic Violence Bill is currently going through a national consultative process. Audits have just been completed in three of the major Ministries, Education, Agriculture and Lands, to identify how they can better contribute to women&rsquo;s empowerment. Zambia is now on track to reach the Millennium Development Goal target of eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education.</P>
        <P>Overall, the national response has focussed on policy and institutional development and has not yet delivered significant results for women throughout the country, especially in rural areas. However, these efforts are at an early stage and it is well recognised that gender equality requires long-term and sustained strategies, along with sustained commitment and action from government. Ireland will continue to support and encourage the Government of Zambia, and indeed all the people of Zambia, in this endeavour.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Considerable progress has been made towards establishing the European External Action Service (EEAS) which is an important innovation under the Lisbon Treaty to support the work of the new High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton. </P>
        <P>Ministers reached a broad political understanding at the 26 April General Affairs Council on the essential elements of a Council Decision which will establish the organisation and functioning of the EEAS. The High Representative, the Commission and the Presidency are now in discussion with representatives of the Parliament and with other stakeholders with the aim of finalising if possible the Council Decision at the June General Affairs Council.</P>
        <P>The Treaty provides that the EEAS will comprise officials from relevant departments of the Commission and the Council Secretariat, as well as staff seconded from national diplomatic services of the Member States. The process for recruiting staff from these three sources will be laid out in the Council Decision when it is adopted. Appropriate amendments to the EU&rsquo;s Staff Regulations will also be required and these are being processed.</P>
        <P>Ireland has consistently pressed for the EEAS recruitment process to be open, transparent and merit-based, while also ensuring that EEAS staffing is representative of the diversity of the Union. In light of the broad agreement at the April GAC, I am confident that the final Decision will reflect this approach to recruitment.</P>
        <P>Irish candidates will be able to compete for positions within the EEAS on an equal footing with candidates from other Member States and from the EU institutions. My Department has <Col N="893"/>sought general expressions of interest from its officers who might consider working for the EEAS and has received a very positive response.</P>
        <P>The overall size of the EEAS is still under consideration and it will be some years before it reaches full operational strength. Staffing from the member States, including Ireland, is likely to start more slowly than from the EU institutions but a target has been set to have one third of the EEAS staff coming from the diplomatic services of the Member States by 1 July 2013. The High Representative will report shortly on how she intends to achieve this target.</P>
        <P>Over time, I believe there will be a real benefit to the State through the experience gained by the rotation of Irish officials between the EEAS and the Irish diplomatic service. I look forward to Irish candidates of the highest calibre being recruited into the new Service.</P>
        <P>Before the EEAS recruitment begins formally, the process of appointing Heads of EU Delegations &mdash; formerly Commission Delegations &mdash; has already been opened to candidates from the diplomatic services of the member states. I understand that a number of Irish candidates, including officers from my own Department, have applied for these posts, of which 31 are due to be filled this year. Applicants were subject to a preselection process and the remaining candidates are being assessed by interview panels on which Member States are represented as observers.</P>

	<P>I announced in the Budget that a carbon tax at a rate of &euro;15 per tonne is being introduced on fossil fuels. The tax was applied to petrol and auto-diesel with effect from midnight, 9 December 2009; and applied from 1 May 2010 to kerosene, marked gas oil (also known as &lsquo;green diesel&rsquo; or &lsquo;agricultural diesel&rsquo;), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas. The application of the tax to coal and commercial peat is subject to a Commencement Order. </P>
        <P>Solid fuels as indicated above are subject to a commencement order; this is to allow time for issues such as fuel poverty and the sourcing of coal of a lower environmental standard from Northern Ireland to be addressed.</P>
        <P>A number of Government Departments, including the Department of Finance are exploring options for how best to offset the impact of the carbon tax on low-income households.  With regard to the sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland, work has already commenced on this matter within the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In addition, the Department of Environment, my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have met with the Solid Fuel Trade Group in this regard.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the UK, at present, does not have a carbon tax, per se, however, the UK Climate Change levy was introduced in 2001. It is understood that the levy is chargeable on the industrial and commercial supply of taxable commodities for lighting, heating and power by consumers in the following sectors of business:</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to customer deposits.  The existing statutory Deposit Guarantee Scheme (&lsquo;DGS&rsquo;) covers retail deposits with all credit institutions authorised in Ireland (including credit unions) up to a maximum of &euro;100,000 per qualifying depositor per institution. The DGS does not have an end-date and will continue to apply after 29 September 2010.</P>
        <P>On-demand deposits over &euro;100,000 and all corporate deposits are currently guaranteed until 29 September 2010 under the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) Scheme.  Term deposits made with participating institutions after they joined the ELG Scheme can be guaranteed for the full term of the deposit even if this extends beyond 29 September 2010, subject to a maximum term of 5 years. Institutions participating in the ELG scheme will be able to advise any customer whether their term deposit is guaranteed on this basis.</P>
        <P>In the statement on the banks which I made on 30 March 2010 I announced that I will be seeking the Commission&rsquo;s agreement for a modified extension of the guarantee.

	<P>I announced, during the debate on the Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009 last March, that the preparation of the draft legislation provided an opportunity to consider once again the position regarding ethical investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) and that I would establish an Interdepartmental Committee to examine the issues further and to report to me.</P>
        <P>The Committee includes representatives of the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Foreign Affairs, as well as officials from my Department and representatives of the National Treasury Management Agency as Manager of the NPRF.</P>
        <P>In its work the Committee has considered the appropriateness and possible nature of an ethical investment policy for the NPRF. The approaches to ethical/responsible investment taken in other countries have been reviewed, and submissions from a number of civil society organisations have also been considered.

        <Quest> the steps he will take to address the concerns expressed by credit unions and the Credit Union Development Association regarding amendments the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 will make to section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997; the concerns the credit unions have expressed regarding the way they will reschedule loans under the new legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of concerns expressed by credit union bodies, including the Credit Union Development Association, regarding the Section 35 proposals associated with the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010.  These concerns are primarily focussed on the provisioning elements of the proposals.  However, the proposals overall represent a balanced approach to the need to facilitate members while at the same time ensuring the stability of credit unions.</P>
        <P>The Registrar of Credit Unions will take a pragmatic approach to the implementation of the new Section 35 requirements and has set out for the credit union representative groups further clarifications relating to the conditions.  These include transitional arrangements for a 15% provisioning requirement to 30 September 2011, trial periods, exceptions with regard to top-up loans and relaxation of the 100% provisioning requirement in respect of rescheduled loans which have missed two or more payments.  The new provisions will be implemented in a balanced and proportionate manner and their effect on credit unions will be closely monitored.</P>
        <P>Concerns have also been raised in relation to the need for the Registrar of Credit Unions to consult with the representative bodies before introducing requirements.  As a matter of general practice, the Registrar consults with the credit union representative bodies before introducing regulations or requirements in relation to any aspect of credit union regulation and I understand that he intends to continue with this approach.  However, the independent position of the Registrar of Credit Unions in carrying out the duty of financial regulation is not open to question and the Registrar has the statutory powers and responsibility to introduce, if necessary without consultation, regulatory requirements in the interests of the well-being and stability of the sector.  For this good reason, a requirement for the Registrar to consult with the sector is not included in the legislation.</P>
        <P>During the second stage reading of the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010, I assured the House that the Registrar of Credit Unions will adopt a balanced and proportionate approach in the application of the loan provisioning requirements which are proposed.  The transitional arrangements as proposed by the Registrar will be introduced.  These will help ease the position for credit unions in the current financial year and the next financial year ending in September 2011. They will also allow time for credit unions to adjust to the new regime.</P>
        <P>I would like to reiterate that there is a balance to be struck between meeting members&rsquo; needs to reschedule loans and ensuring the stability of the credit union sector overall. It is in <Col N="899"/>the interests of every credit union in the country that the stability of the sector is safeguarded. The proposals being brought forward in connection with the Bill will achieve this fundamental aim.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together.</P>
        <P>In my earlier reply of 29 April 2010 to the Deputy, to which she refers, I set out the actions taken by me in response to the recommendations of the Covered Institutions Remuneration <Col N="900"/>Oversight Committee (CIROC) and also where the Government went beyond those recommendations with the introduction of a salary cap of &euro;500,000 with any deviation from this only in exceptional circumstances and with my approval.</P>
        <P>As I explained, it is a matter for the remuneration committees of the covered institutions to ensure that these recommendations are being adhered to; however it is possible that in some cases the remuneration committee maybe restricted because of contractual arrangements entered into with individual senior executives prior to the publication of the CIROC report. I have no legal power under the applicable legislation to force new agreements in such cases for the duration of the existing contracts.</P>
        <P>On the issue of &ldquo;pension cash payments&rdquo;, CIROC stated that: &ldquo;We have become aware of a practice in which cash allowances were paid to compensate for the effects of the &ldquo;pensions cap&rdquo; imposed by the Finance Act, 2006.  Pension schemes should reflect public policy and tax law and it is unacceptable that arrangements should be put in place which would be inconsistent with the intent of the relevant legislation.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I advised the Deputy in my earlier reply that I specifically informed the affected institutions that this practice should cease immediately and I have followed up to ensure that this has happened. At two of the covered institutions payments continue to be made because of pre-existing contractual arrangements to four individuals. In all cases reductions in base salary and/or the &ldquo;pension cash payment&rdquo; have been made.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, last year, in the light of discussions between my Department and the Revenue Commissioners on this aspect of the Report, the matter was  taken up by the Commissioners with the institutions involved, with a view to ensuring that the practices concerned are in compliance with pensions tax provisions and with tax law generally.</P>
        <P>I understand that following the completion of the Revenue Commissioners enquiries, the Commissioners are satisfied that the practices concerned did not contravene the legislation and that the cash payments involved were made subject to the requirements of tax law.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that a primary purpose of the limit on tax relieved pension funds introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006, was to dissuade employers from making excessive tax relieved pension contributions on behalf of favoured employees. This was achieved by imposing a penal rate of tax on the value of pension benefits ultimately drawn down on retirement by such individuals in excess of the cap. The results of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; enquiries would indicate that the 2006 legislation is operating as intended.</P>
        <P>Beyond the review of the &ldquo;pension cash payments&rdquo; for top management, I have included the provision in the Subscription Agreements for State capital investment in the relevant covered institutions to specifically preclude any pension improvement for senior managers without prior consent. No other formal review is currently underway, but the matter will be kept under review in the light of experience.</P>

	<P>I have been assured that Beaumont Hospital will meet its service plan targets for 2010. These involve treating the same number of patients this year as last but with less reliance on in-patient stays.  In turn this will involve reducing inappropriate hospital admissions, more same day of surgery admissions, more day care cases, earlier discharges and reductions in waiting times for elective surgery.  The planned changes announced by Beaumont are designed to allow it deliver its service plan targets while remaining within budget.  For example, the increase in day case activity and the reduction in beds occupied by long-stay patients means the hospital can treat the same number of patients as previously with less in-patient beds.  Beaumont has also assured my Department that neurosurgery, transplantation and cancer services will not be affected by the changes.

Following a full assessment of the current situation, the risks of a second wave, the availability of vaccine and other factors, the National Public Health Emergency Team decided, following advice received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee that those in the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups should continue to be vaccinated.  This means that up to September 2010 the vaccine will continue to be made available to those in the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups including all those travelling to the southern hemisphere during the upcoming influenza season but this will be done through GPs and Maternity Units.

	<P>The Government has considered the outcome of the site investigations at the former Irish Steel/Ispat site at Haulbowline which were undertaken by environmental consultants on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

	<P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.  The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.  Kazakhstan is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.  Once the new legislation is enacted therefore, inter-country adoptions from Kazakhstan will only be possible if Kazakhstan ratifies the Convention or if a bilateral agreement between the two countries is concluded.  At present there are no plans to open negotiations on an bilateral agreement with Kazakhstan.</P>

	<P>I refer further to my reply to Question 195 of the 3rd March 2010.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy, that following the receipt of sanction from the Minister for Finance, a recruitment process commenced in February of this year. Candidates for this process were drawn from those who successfully completed a written examination and were placed on a panel for the position in 2008.</P>
        <P>The recruitment process involves the holding of competitive interviews, medical and health assessments, and security clearance of prospective candidates.</P>
        <P>It is expected that this 2008 panel will be adequate for the current recruitment needs of the Irish Prison Service, and there are no plans to advertise for further applicants.</P>

        <P>The legislation provides that the Garda Commissioner shall not grant a licence unless he is satisfied that the character and previous conduct of an applicant are such that the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold such a licence.</P>
        <P>Applicants originally from outside the State are required to provide relevant police certificates of character and provide details of any convictions received for offences outside the jurisdiction.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na then carry out enquiries through the appropriate channels, with the written consent of the applicant.  If written consent is not given, a licence will not be granted unless An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that a full enquiry has been made in respect of the applicant with the police in the jurisdictions were the applicant has resided.</P>

	<P>Valid applications for certificates of naturalisation on behalf of the persons referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question were received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in January &amp; February 2010.</P>
        <P>All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  Additional resources have been allocated to the Citizenship Division of my Department in order to reduce backlogs and provide a better quality service to all applicants.  This has had a positive impact on processing times and has enabled certain categories of applicant to be dealt with more expeditiously.  These include refugees, spouses of Irish citizens and minors.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the history of this case from my replies to previous Parliamentary Questions. The person concerned does not have any pending application for leave to remain. The person concerned is the subject of a  Deportation Order following a comprehensive examination of his asylum claim and of his application to remain temporarily in the State. In addition he has been evading his deportation since 10 August 2004 and should therefore present himself to the Garda Authorities without any further delay.</P>
        <P>As a matter of policy, I do not intend to reward persons who have failed a very fair and comprehensive asylum process, and who have thereafter proceeded to evade their deportation for several years, by granting such persons residency in the State.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there has been a change in the circumstances of the person concerned, or new information has come to light which has a direct bearing on his case, there remains the option of applying to me for revocation of his Deportation Order pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended.  However I wish to make clear that such an application would require substantial grounds to be successful.</P>
        <P>The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my detailed Reply to his earlier Parliamentary Question, No. 124 of Thursday, 22 April 2010, in this matter.  The position in the State of the person concerned is as set out in that Reply.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might wish to note that it is not the policy of my Department to comment on individual asylum claims.  However, the Deputy can be assured that all asylum applications, including the one lodged by the person concerned, are considered by two statutory independent refugee status determination bodies, namely the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  In assessing each individual asylum application or appeal, the bodies referred to must, in accordance with their statutory remit, have regard for the specific claims made by the applicant, as measured against objective, reputable, up to date information relating to the applicant&rsquo;s country of origin and, where doubts exist, the benefit of the doubt is applied in favour of the applicant. I understand that copies of the determinations made by the two bodies were sent to the person concerned and copies were also sent to his then legal representatives so the person concerned can see from those documents the basis for the conclusions reached in his particular case.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the State has a very fair and comprehensive mechanism in place for the consideration of all asylum applications and, as such, I am satisfied that the asylum application made by the person concerned was given the fullest consideration before a final decision was taken.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 20 May 2004.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 24 April 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should not have a Deportation Order made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 29 October 2004. In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until her application for asylum was decided.  Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. On 17 January 2007, two minor children of the person concerned arrived in the State, were reunited with their mother and included as child dependants in her asylum application meaning that any decision made in relation to her applied equally to them.  </P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 15 November 2007, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her children.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her children should not have Deportation Orders made against them.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned initiated Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in her case. The Judicial Review proceedings were withdrawn on 5 October 2009 meaning that the earlier decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the Minister stood.</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 23 September 2009, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this Order was served by registered post requiring her to present herself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau in order to make arrangements for her removal from the State. She failed to present  and was classified as evading her deportation. She should, therefore, present herself to the GNIB without any further delay.</P>

The person&rsquo;s legal representative was notified by letter dated 21st October, 2009 that an undertaking had been given not to enforce the Deportation Order signed in respect of her until the children&rsquo;s asylum application had been processed.</P>

	<P>Section 6A of the Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004 provides that a person born in the island of Ireland shall not be entitled to be an Irish citizen unless a parent of that person has, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person&rsquo;s birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years.  The section does not apply to certain persons including those born to parents one of whom is at the time of the persons birth an Irish citizen, British citizen or a person entitled to reside without restriction.</P>
        <P>For the purpose of calculating reckonable residence under section 6A certain residence is excluded from consideration including unlawful residence, residence covered by a permission granted under Section 4 of the Immigration Act, 2004 for the purpose of study and residence covered by a provisional permission granted pending determination of an asylum application.  Upon application for a passport, the Passport Office of the Department of Foreign Affairs assesses the child&rsquo;s entitlement to citizenship based upon the parent&rsquo;s reckonable residency.  If the parents do not have sufficient residency the child does not have an entitlement to citizenship.  It remains open to the parent of the child to make an application for a certificate of naturalisation on their behalf under section 15 of the 1956 Act, when the child has 5 years reckonable residency in the State.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service that the  residence status of a foreign national can only be considered by reference to the particular circumstances of the case.  It is not therefore possible to give an indication of the likely residence status which would be granted without reference to the particular circumstances of the individual concerned.</P>
        <P>However, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the administrative arrangements that have been put in place to address the situation whereby employment permit holders have been made redundant.  These administrative arrangements &ldquo;New provisions for Non-EEA workers who are made redundant&rdquo; are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).  Further information on the operation of these arrangements is also available on the website of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (www.entemp.ie).</P>
        <P>In general, a person who has been living and working legally in the State for less than 5 years on the basis of an employment permit and who has been made redundant may be granted a six month grace period during which time they can seek to find another employer.  The labour market needs test will not be required in respect of employment permit applications made on foot of these arrangements.  The administrative arrangements also include special provision for those who have been working for 5 years with an employment permit whereby such persons may be exempted from the requirement to hold an employment permit and may be granted a stamp 4 permission.</P>
        <P>Applications for long term residency are considered in respect of persons who have <b>resided legally (as per endorsements in  passport) </b> for a period of 60 months or longer on the basis of Work Permit, Work Authorisation, or Working Visa conditions.  An exemption from Work Permit requirements is considered at the same time.  However, if the Deputy has a specific case in mind and wishes to furnish the particulars,  officials in the Immigration Division of my Department will be happy to advise.</P>

        <P>With regard to Israel&rsquo;s accession to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), on the basis of formal opinions and all other relevant technical information, the Secretary-General of the OECD recommended to the OECD Council that Israel be invited to accede to the Organisation.  The 31 member countries of the Council of the OECD, including Ireland, accepted that recommendation at its meeting on 10 May.</P>

	<P>The Government is extremely concerned about the recent surge in violence in Thailand, including the army assault on the protesters&rsquo; encampment in central Bangkok early on the morning of 19 May.  This has resulted in five deaths and dozens of injuries, in addition to the thirty-six deaths which have already occurred since 13 May.    The protests have been led by the United Front of Democracy against Dictatorship, also known as the &ldquo;red-shirts&rdquo;, and have been underway since 13 March.  The <Col N="923"/>&ldquo;red-shirts&rdquo; are supporters of the former Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted after a military coup in September 2006.  They regard the current Government as illegitimate and have called for the dissolution of Parliament and for new elections.</P>
        <P>Following negotiations between the Government and protesters earlier this month, it appeared that a compromise between the parties had been reached, with Prime Minister Abhisit proposing a &ldquo;reconciliation plan&rdquo; and offering to hold elections in November.  However, the Prime Minister&rsquo;s offer was conditional on the protesters ending their occupation of the main shopping district in Bangkok.  For their part, the protesters vowed to remain in the encampment until the Prime Minister set a specific date for dissolving Parliament.  With neither party prepared to compromise, the Government has now intervened to close the encampment.  I very much regret the loss of life involved, on both sides.</P>
        <P>The EU recently expressed grave concern about the situation in Thailand, urging both sides in the conflict to negotiate and to solve the political crisis through peaceful and democratic means.  The &ldquo;red-shirts&rdquo; had appealed for EU observers to be sent to Thailand but the Thai government had insisted that it had the situation under control and did not need external assistance.</P>
        <P>Replying to a Parliamentary Question on 30 March, I welcomed talks which had taken place between the Prime Minister and the &ldquo;red-shirt&rdquo; protesters and I expressed the hope that these talks would lay the foundation for broader dialogue on the range of issues which divide Thailand.  I remain of the view that, if political stability is to be achieved and if Thailand is to successfully address the many challenges it faces, it is vitally important for the parties there to engage in dialogue and to work with each other in a spirit of peaceful, national reconciliation.  The Government believes that the crisis can only be resolved through peaceful and democratic means.  Together with our EU partners, we will do all in our power to promote this outcome.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty has resulted in significant changes in the organisation and architecture of the European institutions. These include the creation of a full-time President of the European Council, the establishment of the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the creation of a European External Action Service (EEAS), which is intended to support the work of the High Representative. </P>
        <P>Given the central role that the EEAS is to play in the EU&rsquo;s external relations, under the responsibility of the High Representative, Ireland and some of our EU partners have been <Col N="924"/>working to ensure that the position of development policy is maintained in the context of a more coherent and integrated EU foreign policy. In particular, we have wanted to ensure that effective development programming is achieved across the EU external actions, with no loss of commitment to poverty reduction and to aid effectiveness.</P>
        <P>Political agreement has been reached by the Member States on the proposal of the High Representative to achieve a coherent balance of programming responsibilities between the External Action Service and the Development Commissioner. The proposal explicitly notes that the Commission will be involved in all stages of the programming cycle and that all programming decisions to be taken will be prepared through Commission procedures and submitted to the Commission for decision. In this context, the Development Commissioner will have the right of veto over all programming decisions, including for the European Development Fund and the Development Cooperation Instrument. These are the primary EU financial instruments for the disbursement of development funding.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, in response to proposals made by some Member States, including Ireland, the revised draft Council Decision, to be submitted to Ministers in the coming weeks, now refers specifically to Article 208 of the Lisbon Treaty, which places development at the centre of EU external policy. There is also an explicit statement that the &ldquo;EEAS should promote the fulfilment of the objectives of the European Consensus on Development and the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In line with the spirit and ambition of the Lisbon Treaty, I am confident that, with the cooperation of the High Representative, the Development Commissioner and the Member States, the new arrangements on the functioning of the External Action Service should lead to the more effective integration of development into the EU&rsquo;s broader foreign policy, while continuing to ensure that funds allocated for development are disbursed effectively in pursuit of the EU&rsquo;s development goals.</P>

	<P>Ireland and its E.U. partners continue to monitor closely the situation in Iran, including the prosecution of academics, students and others who protested peacefully following the 2009 Presidential election. I am gravely concerned about the detentions of these protestors, the denial of education to students found to be involved in the protests, and the mass trials and summary executions which followed the 2009 protests. </P>
        <P>I have reported to the House on a number of occasions (most recently PQ 16557/10) on my concerns regarding the case of Dr. Kian Tajbakhsh, a dual US-Iranian national arrested in July 2009. Dr. Tajbakhsh&rsquo;s case was heard by an appeals court on 10 February and his sentence was set at five years for a variety of charges linked to the post-election disturbances in Iran. These charges have been strenuously denied by the US Government, which has called for his release. In a statement on Dr. Tajbakhsh&rsquo;s case on 1 December 2009, the EU Presidency described the case as &ldquo;deeply worrying&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The latest reports are that Dr. Tajbakhsh was released on bail on 13 March for the Iranian New Year and allowed to return to his family and that his release period was further extended in early April. It remains to be seen whether he will be permitted to leave the country. The <Col N="925"/>Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which represents US interests in Iran, continues to work strongly on this case.</P>
        <P>On a positive note, I welcome the release earlier this week of French academic Clothilde Reiss, who had been detained in Iran since last July and convicted of a number of serious offences after taking photographs of opposition demonstrations. Ireland raised Mme. Reiss&rsquo; case directly with the Iranian authorities and added our voice to the many others calling for her release.</P>
        <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government and its E.U. partners will continue to monitor closely all suppression of dissent by the Iranian authorities. Senior officials of my Department have raised Dr. Tajbakhsh&rsquo;s case directly with the Iranian Ambassador to Ireland and have made clear our concerns at his sentencing. We will continue to bring cases such as Dr. Tajbakhsh to the attention of the Iranian authorities. We will also avail of every opportunity to express our concerns about human rights in Iran, both nationally and in an EU and international context.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 161 together. </P>
        <P>As I have stated on several previous occasions in answer to very similar questions, it is not the policy of the Government to list countries most seriously affected by such issues as famine, war, genocide or human rights abuses, which are issues that affect many countries in Africa and elsewhere, and I shall therefore not focus on individual countries.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of hunger and famine, it is estimated that more than a billion people today do not have enough food. Ireland is responding to this challenge, working bilaterally in our programme countries with our EU and partners, and at a global level through the UN agencies. Since the publication of the report of the Hunger Task Force in September 2008, Ireland&rsquo;s focus on hunger reduction has become a cornerstone of Irish Aid&rsquo;s development programme. In particular, efforts are concentrated on the three priority areas identified in the report, namely: increasing smallholder agricultural productivity in Africa; targeting under-nutrition (especially maternal and infant); and promoting governance and leadership action on tackling global hunger. Nowhere is this work more challenging than in countries affected by conflict where it is critically important to move quickly with large-scale emergency food assistance in order to save lives.</P><Col N="926"/>
        <P>Irish Aid is committed to responding to emerging global hunger issues.  Funds are targeted at a number of different agriculture, food security and nutrition interventions.  Food assistance and therapeutic care save lives when starvation has already caused malnutrition but it is also vitally important to focus on prevention &mdash; to reach vulnerable groups through nutritional interventions which have long-term positive effects.  This means a particular focus on women and young children.  Best practice and scientific research demonstrates that by intervening as early and aggressively as possible during the short interval from pregnancy to 24 months of age leads to greater reductions in child under-nutrition than later interventions aimed at reversing under-nutrition.</P>
        <P>With regard to security, UN and EU peacekeeping missions in Africa have a role in stabilising former and current conflict zones. Members of the Irish Defence Forces have participated in numerous UN and EU peacekeeping missions in Africa, including in the Congo, Eritrea, Liberia and most recently in Chad.</P>
        <P>Situations which fully conform to an internationally accepted definition of genocide are thankfully extremely rare. Nevertheless, there are a number of current situations in Africa which give rise to extreme concern. The UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide is mandated to alert the international community to the potential of genocide in a particular country or region, and to make recommendations on actions to prevent or halt genocide.</P>
        <P>Human rights concerns remain central to our foreign policy. Together with our EU partners, Ireland monitors closely the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official and non-governmental organisations.</P>
        <P>Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question. We do this either bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council, including, in the case of the latter, through the new Universal Periodic Review process whereby the human rights performance of each UN State is reviewed.</P>
        <P>Active participation in multilateral organisations such as the EU, the UN and the Council of Europe provides opportunities for Ireland to voice its concerns regarding human rights abuses. Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for the violation of human rights.</P>
        <P>For example, together with our EU partners, Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</P>
        <P>In developing a sustainable approach which properly addresses the root causes of famine, war, genocide and human rights abuses, African leadership and responsibility are crucial. This is recognised by the EU and UN, which are both working to build the capacities of African States and the African Union to respond to these challenges. Ireland is committed to playing its part in this work, and I believe that our comprehensive and inclusive approach to the challenges of poverty, hunger and famine, conflict, security and human rights abuses stands the best chance of facilitating real and positive change in the lives of millions of people in Africa.</P>

	<P>As Deputies will be aware from previous statements in this House, the Government has long been deeply concerned about the situation in Burma. We are very actively engaged at EU and international level in monitoring the situation in that country and in efforts to support the Burmese people in their struggle for justice, democracy and development. </P>
        <P>The situation at present is particularly difficult and I regret that there is very little of a positive nature, in terms of the situation and initiatives, on which I can report. The Burmese authorities are pushing ahead with plans to hold elections later this year. Despite a broad view that the terms of the discredited 2008 Constitution virtually precluded the possibility of credible elections, the international community felt it important to do all in its power to urge the regime to conduct elections, and an electoral process, in a way which would be free, fair, inclusive and transparent. We also made clear the need for all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, to be released without delay and for a process of national dialogue and reconciliation, involving all opposition and ethnic groups, to be initiated in advance of the elections. Ireland, the EU, the UN and even a number of ASEAN Members played an active role in such efforts. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was particularly clear in articulating international expectations during his visit to the country last July.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, however, none of this has happened. Instead of being given her freedom, Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s detention was extended for a period of 18 months in August last year, to ensure that she would not be in a position to contest the elections or lead her party in them. Few other political prisoners were released. No effort was made to initiate national dialogue. Military offensives against a number of other ethnic groups continue, designed to crush their resistance in the lead-up to the elections.</P>
        <P>The electoral laws issued on 10 March by the Burmese authorities demonstrated unequivocally that there is no interest on their part in listening to what their own people or the international community have been saying in terms of the elections, and no intention to permit an electoral process which might be deemed credible or legitimate by any objective standards. Instead of providing for an inclusive process, which would permit opposition and ethnic groups to participate freely, the electoral laws demonstrated that the elections would be run entirely on the regime&rsquo;s terms and that the regime intended to control every aspect of their preparation, their outcome and the future government that will emerge from them.</P>
        <P>The most serious consequence of these electoral laws are the restrictions placed on the registration of political parties and individuals, which have effectively forced Aung San Suu Kyi and her NLD party, who have done much to promote justice, democracy and reconciliation in Burma, out of the process,. While this is a deeply troubling development, Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s, and the NLD&rsquo;s decision not to participate in the elections is one we must respect. We will continue to support her in whatever way we can.</P>
        <P>In terms of interventions and initiatives in relation to the current situation in Burma, Deputies will be aware that the Obama Administration made a decision to increase its engagement with the Burmese regime, with a view to determining if such a course might help to achieve the objective of dialogue and credible elections. While US Assistant Secretary Kurt Campbell has paid two visits to Burma in this context, the second last week, and although he succeeded in meeting separately with Aung San Suu Kyi and members of her NLD party, he was unable to make any progress on the agenda of electoral inclusiveness, credibility and legitimacy. The US are not optimistic that the regime will change its position between now and <Col N="928"/>the time of the elections. They will, however, continue to engage with Burma and its regime, while keeping sanctions intact.</P>
        <P>The EU plans a similar approach. The European Council agreed last December that, while maintaining its sanctions policy, the EU should send an exploratory, official-level, mission to Burma to examine the possibilities for a more pro-active EU role there. Given the range of negative developments in Burma, I called for a discussion on the situation in Burma and the EU&rsquo;s response to it to take place at the April Foreign Affairs Council. At that Council, we highlighted our very serious concerns at the current situation and, as regards the proposed EU Mission, urged that this be very carefully considered, planned and targeted, with precise terms of reference to be prepared. While there may be grounds for re-assessing the advisability of such a Mission at all, I believe that we should listen to the strong message coming from Aung San Suu Kyi in favour of international engagement.</P>

	<P>Together with its EU partners, Ireland attaches considerable importance to achieving stability in the Western Balkans. A significant factor in building stability is the EU perspective for the countries of the region. The June 2003 European Council in Thessaloniki agreed that the future of the countries of the Western Balkans was in the EU. The European Union&rsquo;s Stabilisation and Association process provides the framework for cooperation on economic, political and legal matters aimed at bringing the Western Balkan countries towards EU standards and principles in order to meet EU accession requirements. </P>
        <P>The Spanish Presidency is organising a high-level conference of EU and Western Balkans leaders in Sarajevo on 2 June. It is expected that representatives of the US, Russia and Turkey will also be present. The conference will be an important opportunity to advance the European perspective of the region.</P>
        <P>There has been a series of positive developments in the Western Balkans over the past six months. In December 2009, Justice Ministers of the countries in the Schengen Agreement area granted visa-free travel to citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The European Commission continues to work with Bosnia Herzegovina and Albania to assist those countries in meeting the Schengen criteria for visa-free travel. This may be achieved in the coming months. Also in December, EU Foreign Ministers agreed to implement the Interim Agreement on Trade aspects of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia.</P>
        <P>Relations between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have been improving in recent months. Turkey is playing an important role in this regard. In February, Bosnia appointed an Ambassador to Serbia for the first time in three years. On 31 March 2010, the Serbian parliament adopted a resolution condemning the massacre of 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica by Bosnian-Serb forces in 1995. Serbian President Tadic and Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan will make a joint visit to Srebrenica in July to participate in commemoration ceremonies for the 15th anniversary of the massacre.</P><Col N="929"/>
        <P>I met with the Serbian Foreign Minister in December, and he reiterated the intention of Serbia to prioritise its policy of EU membership. At the end of December, Serbia applied to join the EU.</P>
        <P>An EU/US initiative on Bosnia and Herzegovina last October brought local party leaders together to discuss necessary political reforms. While these talks were not immediately successful, the EU continues to engage in efforts to secure political progress, including the transition from the Office of the High Representative to a reinforced EU Special Representative. EU Ministers pledged in January to remain fully engaged with the leaders of Bosnia Herzegovina to secure political progress in advance of the elections. In this regard, I had a very useful discussion with the Foreign Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Sven Alkalaj, during his official visit to Dublin on 31 March. In the run-up to next October&rsquo;s general election in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the EU will monitor events in the country closely.</P>
        <P>With respect to Kosovo, the EU and the international community will continue to build on the progress towards stability which is underway in the country, as evinced most clearly by the peaceful conduct of the local elections in November last. The advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legality of Kosovo&rsquo;s declaration of independence is expected before the end of the year. In this context, the EU will work closely with the governments of Serbia and Kosovo to seek pragmatic solutions to allow them both to move forward towards eventual EU membership and enhanced regional co-operation.</P>

	<P>In 2005, the leaders of the G8 countries, at their Summit in Gleneagles, agreed to establish the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), with a focus on the cancellation of the heavy debt burden on developing countries. It was intended to supplement the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative which was launched in 1996 to reduce the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels. </P>
        <P>The MDRI came into effect on 1 July 2006, and provides for cancellation of eligible debt from the World Bank, the African Development Fund and the IMF for many of the world&rsquo;s poorest and most indebted countries, most of them in Africa. In 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank agreed to provide similar debt relief to the five poorest countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.  The overall aim is to relieve these countries from the burden of servicing debt and assist them in making progress on the UN Millennium Development Goals.</P>
        <P>To date, the total debt relief provided by the international community to eligible countries under both of these international initiatives has been $102.4 billion, of which $ 3.35 billion has been provided by the IMF, in line with the commitments into which it entered.</P>
        <P>Ireland is recognised internationally for the role we are playing in focusing on the reduction of global poverty and hunger and making international aid more effective for developing countries. We have strongly supported initiatives to ease or cancel the debt burden. Importantly, Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral assistance to the developing world is exclusively in the form of grants rather than loans. Ireland&rsquo;s share of the total cost of debt relief provided by the World Bank under the MDRI is &euro;58.64 million. The Government contributed this amount in full in 2006. Ireland has also contributed over &euro;20 million towards the cost of implementing the HIPC initiative.</P><Col N="930"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s debt policy strategy was prepared jointly by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Finance, and was launched in 2002. It supports the total cancellation of the debts of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. A joint review of the strategy is currently being undertaken by the two Departments and an updated debt strategy is currently being drafted.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Passport Service takes the issue of passport fraud very seriously. Dedicated teams, in each of the Passport Offices, work to identify potential fraud at the time of application. These teams work closely with each other, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with the Passport Services of other jurisdictions, particularly the British Identity and Passport Service. The Passport Service computer system provides the teams with a range of reporting tools to assist in this regard. It is intended that the system will be further extended later this year to include a facial recognition component which will be a major advance in the capture of potential fraudulent applications. The Service is also looking to develop a certified training programme, to be delivered by one of the Institutes of Technology, to increase the skill level of staff working in this specialised area.</P>
        <P>The Passports Act, 2008 formalised and codified passport legislation and introduced a series of offences for passport fraud. In March 2009, the first prosecution under the Act was taken against an individual. The person pleaded guilty to the charge of having, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, in his possession or control a passport that is, and that he knew to be, a false passport. The person was sentenced to nine months imprisonment with six months of the sentence suspended.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the new APS passport in 2005 and the addition of a biometric feature in October 2006 has greatly enhanced the security of the Irish passport and made it much more difficult to counterfeit. The old pre APS passports are being phased out over the next five years. Given the number of pre APS passports still valid (approximately 2 million), it would not be possible to recall all these documents before their expiry date. Allowing such passports to continue in circulation is in line with international practise.</P>

I understand that the pool is closed to the public at present pending a decision on its refurbishment, and that the Board of management is at present awaiting a report on the extent and cost of this refurbishment.  </P>
        <P>The current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, operated by the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport provides grant aid to a maximum of &euro;3.8m to Local Authorities, towards the capital cost of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools.  Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the project must be considered, supported and submitted by the relevant local authority.  The current round of the programme closed to applicants on 31 July 2000 and no application was received from Dublin City Council by that date on behalf of the pool in question.  Under the programme, 45 pools have been opened throughout the country with a further 12 pools at various stages of development.  No decision has been taken on the timing of a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  When a new round of the Programme is launched it will be open to all Local Authorities and voluntary organisations which have the support of a local authority to submit an application under the terms that will apply.</P>

	<P>Payment of illness benefit, to the person concerned, was disallowed by a Deciding Officer following an examination by a Medical Assessor of the Department who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work. An appeal was opened and in the context of that appeal, she was examined by a second Medical Assessor who also expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that, following receipt of the relevant Departmental papers including comments on the grounds of appeal, the appeal from the person concerned will be referred to an Appeals Officer for consideration. There has been a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There has been an increase of a further 46% in the number of appeals received in the first quarter of 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The role of a statutorily appointed deciding officer is to decide entitlement to statutory social welfare schemes. There is no provision in social welfare legislation that allows retention of a payment by a person where a deciding officer has decided that they are not entitled to same.  Accordingly, there are no statutory provisions allowing the retention of any such payment pending the outcome of an appeal.</P>
        <P>Customers whose claims are disallowed, who are disqualified from payment or who are awarded social welfare at a reduced rate are informed that, if they have any new facts or evidence that has a bearing on their case, they should send it in the first instance to the Deciding Officer for re-examination and, if appropriate, for revision of the decision. They are informed that this right is in addition to their right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. They can seek a Deciding Officer Review before making an appeal, or can do both concurrently. It is open to a person to apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance while their appeal is being processed.</P>

       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In order to qualify for rent supplement a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons or in an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for Rent Supplement.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Where the applicant has been residing in private resident accommodation the person must have been able to reasonably afford the rent at the commencement of the tenancy and has experienced a substantial change in their circumstances where they are now unable to pay the rent.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by the relevant local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Where a person does not fulfil the above criteria they are generally requested to apply for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support with the local housing authority in the area where the person intends to reside.

	<P>In order to facilitate the continued independent occupancy of their own homes by older people and people with a disability, a revised suite of Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes was implemented on 1 November 2007. These schemes are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department, together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority. The detailed administration of these schemes, including the assessment and approval of applications and the payment of grants to individual applicants, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.  The new schemes target the available resources to those in most need, streamline operational and administrative procedures and ensure equity and consistency of operation across all local authority areas.   </P>
        <P>Having regard to the continued priority which the Government attaches to these schemes and following a comprehensive assessment of the overall level of demand for grant assistance this year, I approved a record Exchequer allocation of &euro;80 million to the local authorities on 5 March, 2010. Over the period 1 January 2010 to 17 May 2010, around 15% of the overall allocation, amounting to &euro;12.179 million, has been recouped by my Department in respect of some 2,145 individual grant payments under the various grant measures. So far no local authority has drawn down the full allocation for 2010 and my Department has not been formally advised of any local authorities having discontinued the schemes in their areas.</P>
        <P>To support the implementation of the grant schemes, my Department issued detailed administrative guidance on the operation of the schemes to all local authorities. Local authorities have discretion in determining the eligibility of works or adaptations for grant assistance, having <Col N="939"/>regard to the particular needs of individual applicants. In order to ensure that the available funding is spent as effectively as possible, local authorities are asked to target the grant assistance at essential works and to prioritise applications on the basis of medical need.</P>
        <P>My Department continually monitors expenditure by local authorities under the schemes with a view to reallocating the available funding in the event of any savings arising in a particular local authority. Where allocations are likely to be either less than or surplus to requirements, local authorities have been asked to advise my Department accordingly, in order to facilitate the reallocation of any unspent funding and to obtain optimum effectiveness from the funding available. Local authorities have also been requested to set aside part of their allocation to deal with any emergency applications which might arise throughout the year.</P>

	<P>The Government has considered the position in relation to the former Irish Steel/Ispat site at Haulbowline noting the outcome of the site investigations and the recommendations of the environmental consultants. </P>
        <P>The Government decided that the Office of Public Works would chair a working group to develop a structured and coherent approach to the further management and development of the site, with Cork County Council continuing to discharge site management responsibilities on an agency basis. The Group has now been convened by the OPW.</P>
        <P>Regarding the issue of any studies in regard to human health the Government noted the outcomes of the independent and rigorous assessment of site conditions on Haulbowline. This comprised three distinct modules:</P>
        <P el="5">1.  <?oasys _ix ?>assessment of any health or environmental risks posed by current site conditions;</P>
        <P el="5">2. <?oasys _ix ?>assessing quality of surface water, marine sediment and mussel bivalves in the vicinity; and</P>
       <P el="5">3. <?oasys _ix ?>ambient air monitoring.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The consultants had available the advice of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Marine Institute and the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
        <P>Ambient air monitoring was undertaken in accordance with relevant national and international occupational exposure limit values, finding that air quality complied with all relevant standards and guidelines, including in Cobh which was the main population centre monitored, and that there is no occupational risk to human health from airborne substances. Similarly, the assessment of water, sediment and mussel samples employed the relevant applicable screening criteria and found no identifiable risk to the residents of Cork Harbour.</P>
        <P>In the case of assessing the health and environmental risks posed by potential contaminants in the waste material on the East Tip itself the screening was undertaken using human health generic assessment criteria which are derived from guidance issued in the UK. These criteria were considered most appropriate for the site, are conservative for on-site exposures for current <Col N="940"/>land use, and did not suggest a risk to the health of people on site undertaking normal activities or to those in the Cork harbour area including the Naval Base.</P>

        <Quest> the terms and conditions of the various housing schemes currently being promoted throughout the various local authorities; the likely cost to the local authorities or the Exchequer in the short or long-term in respect of each scheme; the degree to which the cost of housing units is determined by the market currently or otherwise; the length of tenancy or lease before purchase is facilitated in specific schemes; if due regard is being had for the impact on first time buyers; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Local authorities operate a wide range of housing programmes for households of varying income levels, including supports to facilitate home-ownership amongst low-income to modest income groups who cannot access housing on the open market. Details of the range of schemes in place are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie. </P>
        <P>The total allocation for the various housing programmes in 2010 &mdash; voted and non-voted &mdash; is &euro;1,874m. The provision for 2011 and subsequent years will be determined in the context of the Estimates for Public Services for those years.</P>
        <P>Addressing housing need remains a high priority for the Government. While ensuring that we can deliver across the full range of needs, the scale and composition of the public housing programme in the years ahead will be dependent on a number of factors, including the level of available funding, the comparative cost effectiveness of the various means of delivering social housing and the evolution of the housing market generally.</P>
        <P>I am determined to ensure that the programme is framed in a manner which continues to optimise the delivery of social housing.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing market conditions, and explore alternative solutions to address housing needs, having full regard to the sustainable communities philosophy outlined in the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities<i>.</i></P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 195 together.</P>
        <P>Neither area cited in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question has been designated for inclusion as part of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).</P>
        <P>Prior to the commencement of the NBS a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to help determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, were to be excluded.</P>
        <P>EU State aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</P>
        <P>That mapping exercise found a number of broadband suppliers were already active in the areas referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question and consequently the localities were excluded from the Scheme.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at www.callcosts.ie</P>
        <P>It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently considering the design and implementation of a scheme which would use this funding to address the issue of basic broadband availability to un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  As the scheme is only at the design stage, there is no application process at this juncture.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</P>

        <P>Notwithstanding this, I am informed by SEAI that on this occasion, payment was declined to the homeowner as works were completed prior to grant approval being received.  The specific sequence of events was as follows: Application received 17th February 2010; Letter of Offer <Col N="942"/>issued 24th February 2010; Works completed 2nd January 2010 as indicated on the Declaration of Works received from the applicant at time of grant claim.</P>
        <P>SEAI cannot pay grants for work carried out prior to application, as the scheme is designed to stimulate and incentivise investment as distinct from rewarding past investment.  The fact that the works were already undertaken before application was made would mean that neither the homeowner nor the contractor can be bound by the terms of the scheme.  SEAI informs me that the applicant would have been made aware of this in the application form and application guide and would have signed a form accepting this fundamental condition, which in effect voids the grant offer.  Unfortunately there are no grounds for appeal and SEAI cannot pay the grant.</P>

	<P>The development and expansion of the natural gas network is in the first instance a commercial matter for Gaslink, which is mandated under Section 8 of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas that is both economical and efficient.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is a statutory, independent body, has, since 2002, been charged with all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.</P>
        <P>The CER, in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  This is to ensure that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</P>
        <P>Gaslink recently announced the connection of Kells and three additional towns to the gas network. The announcement follows the completion of Phase 3 of the New Towns Study carried out by Gaslink.  The study is a comprehensive assessment of 39 towns not already connected to the national gas network.  The study was approved for publication by the CER following detailed economic analysis based on the criteria outlined in the CER&rsquo;s Connection Policy.</P>
        <P>Timing and roll-out to the four towns will be on a phased basis and will be dependent on demand, interest and industrial/commercial development in each town.  Gaslink is working with local authorities, businesses and developers in each of the towns to ensure that natural gas flows to these towns as soon as economically viable.  Gaslink will continue to review towns which did not qualify for connection under the Study and other towns on an ongoing basis.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, probably resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</P>

	<P>My Department actively encourages forest owners to thin their crops, where silviculturally appropriate.  Not all forests are suitable for thinning.  If a forest is exposed to high winds or located on unstable soils, the risk of thinning may outweigh the advantages.  Thinning can not only improve the quality of the final crop trees, it can also provide a source of intermediate income for forest owners. </P>
        <P>In recent years my Department, in conjunction with COFORD, has funded a number of projects aimed at encouraging the development of wood energy supply chains.  These projects have a two-fold purpose, firstly to provide a market for the increasing level of thinnings from grant-aided plantations and secondly to develop the supply of wood biomass to the renewable energy market.  The increasing demand for energy wood is providing a vital market for small diameter logs from thinning operations and this demand has stimulated increased management and timber output from private forests.</P>
        <P>My Department has also provided start-up funding to a number of forest-owner producer groups to encourage private forest owners to work collectively in the management of their forests and marketing of forest products, with a particular emphasis on thinning operations.</P>
        <P>In addition the forest road scheme operated by my Department provides grant aid for the construction of forest roads which will facilitate the extraction of timber from thinnings in private forests in a cost-effective manner.  This scheme is open and applications are currently being processed.</P>

	<P>Under EU legislation (Council Regulation 104/2000 and Commission Regulation 2065/2001) fishery products, including Lobsters must be labelled with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation catchment, common name and species name.  The food business operator must also be in a position to trace the fishery product (Lobster) one step back in the supply chain, and ensuring that all labelling information from the supplier is maintained during the forward selling process, including, to the consumer.  The main legislation covering the labelling, presentation and advertising of food in Ireland is EU Directive 2001/13/EC, European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2002 (SI483/2002) and EU Directive 2003/89/EC which states that the consumer must not be misled with regard to labelling.  It would therefore be contrary the food labelling regulations for imported US/Canadian lobster to be labelled as originating in the EU.  Origin labelling does bring its own complexities with provisions in customs legislation for imported foods to undergo &lsquo;substantial transformation&rsquo; to assume the origin of the country where that processing occurred. </P>
        <P>The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) is responsible for verification of accurate labelling in seafood establishments up to but not including retail.  Such checks including accurate origin labelling, are incorporated into ongoing official controls at those establishments.  The <Col N="946"/>SFPA maintains a confidential helpline whereby information on potential non-compliances in seafood sector can be confidentially passed on for investigation by the appropriate agency.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of food labelling legislation in retail outlets rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  Checks on compliance are incorporated into routine inspections of retail establishments.  These inspections are carried out by the Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) in the Health Service Executive (HSE) operating under a service contract with the FSAI.</P>

It should also be noted that a similar set of criteria is used by the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health), and the disease is not listed by that organisation either.</P>
        <P>Council Directive 2006/88/EDC has been transposed by S.I. No 261 of 2008.  The crustacean diseases to be controlled at national level reflect those outlined in the Directive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) with statutory responsibility to ensure that each child attends a  recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The remit of the Board was extended in 2009. The extended remit brings together the Visiting Teacher Service for Travellers (VTST), the Home School Community Liaison  Service (HSCL) and the School Completion Programme (SCP) as well as the National Educational Welfare Service (EWS) under one common management team. </P>
        <P>The NEWB&rsquo;s network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) is one of the key means by which the Board ensures that each child attends and benefits from education. Key aspects of the role of an EWO is to advise parents in relation to the procedures for enrolment in schools and assist parents where they are experiencing difficulties in finding school places.</P>
        <P>In response to the matter raised I can inform the deputy that the NEWB has advised my Department that the parent(s) of the child in question has not made contact with the NEWB to seek assistance with securing a school place for this child.</P><Col N="949"/>
        <P>To be of assistance with this matter the NEWB has provided my officials with details of the relevant EWO who is available to assist the parents in securing a school place. Officials in my Department will arrange to have these details forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS. </P>
        <P>In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</P>
        <P>I have made enquiries with my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service in relation to the pupil referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question and can confirm that while the NEPs psychologist assigned to the relevant school is aware of the case, no approach has been made by school authorities in relation to the current assessment or review of the child. The NEPS service is available to provide any relevant assistance requested by school authorities in this instance and I would suggest that the child&rsquo;s parents raise the matter with the school principal.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may be aware that my Department has put in place a range of teaching and care supports for pupils with special educational needs. These include the provision of additional teaching and/or special needs assistant support in schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, including Down&rsquo;s Syndrome.</P>
        <P>All primary schools have the benefit of additional Learning Support/Resource Teaching support through the General Allocation System. One of the benefits of the general allocation system is that it has put support teaching resources in place in schools on a more systematic basis and enables them to support pupils with high incidence special educational needs immediately. Some pupils with Down&rsquo;s Syndrome, based on their psychological assessment, have been assessed as having a high incidence special educational need.</P><Col N="950"/>
        <P>Other pupils with Down&rsquo;s Syndrome fall within the low incidence range of special educational needs. The National Council for Special Education will sanction additional teaching hours where a primary school pupil has been assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need. The General Allocation Model is only available in primary schools. Second level schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs are also allocated additional teaching hours. The number of additional teaching hours sanctioned ranges from one-and-a-half hours to five hours per week depending on the pupil&rsquo;s special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Special needs assistant posts are allocated to schools to support students with care needs. Funding has been made available for specialist furniture and/or assistive technology if this is required. My Department can also fund special school transport arrangements.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the school was approved a devolved grant to build an additional two classrooms to meet the school&rsquo;s most immediate needs.  The school was advised of this by letter from my Department on 7th May 2010.</P>
        <P>In relation to the learning support resource teacher, the general allocation model was introduced in primary schools in September 2005 to ensure that each school has learning support/resource teaching support available to meet the needs of children with high incidence special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Schools decide themselves how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils and how to adjust their support in line with the changing needs of pupils as they mature. The Department provided a circular SP ED 02/05 to schools to assist them in deploying the General Allocation Model resources.</P>
        <P>In that context, I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers did make an application for resource teaching.  However, the application had insufficient information so the school were requested to re-submit their application.</P>
