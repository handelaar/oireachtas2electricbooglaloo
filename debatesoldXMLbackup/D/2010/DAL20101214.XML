      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Savings of up to &euro;35 million will be implemented from my group of Votes, which includes the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, by 2014.  The focus of savings is primarily aimed at administrative efficiencies given that most of the expenditure across this group of Votes comprises administrative budgets.  The total allocation for my Department in the Estimates set out in the budget book for 2011 is &euro;25.062 million.  This is an overall decrease of 15% &mdash; &euro;4.394 million &mdash; on the 2010 Revised Estimates allocation.  This includes a reduction of 15% in the administrative budget.  Savings will be achieved through administrative and operational efficiencies as set out in the Department&rsquo;s action plan, which includes commitments with regard to staff numbers, budgets, procurement and shared services.  In light of the nature of the work of the Department, the action plan is closely aligned with measures to improve the effectiveness of the Civil Service as a whole, in particular through enhanced mobility and shared service provision.</P>
        <P>The outputs of the CSO are demand-driven to a large degree and respond to European Union and national statistical obligations.  The CSO has also achieved operational savings and continues to prioritise work programmes in light of emerging budgets.  The 2011 allocation for the CSO includes significant additional resources to provide for conducting the 2011 census of population.  These resources will be reduced in 2012 and in subsequent years.  The outputs of the law offices are also demand-driven.  In addition to securing economies and increased operational efficiencies, the law offices have been exerting strong control in respect of expenditure on legal fees.  This will be continued in the coming years.</P>
        <P>With regard to the measures set out in the national recovery plan to enhance competitiveness, increase active labour market policy efforts and accelerate the rate of economic growth, my Department will support the implementation of these measures through the work of the relevant Cabinet committees and their associated senior officials groups.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the proposed savings in the Department of the Taoiseach and its associated group of Votes, are reductions in staffing levels envisaged?  The Taoiseach should outline the position in respect of both the Department and the other offices.</P>
        <P>The annual report for 2009 for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was published today.  The DPP stated in the report that his office was very stretched and that in the event of an increase in the workload of the office something must give.  Will the Taoiseach assure Members that no prosecution will not be pursued or that no prosecution will be delayed on foot of any savings that are to be made in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?  If a Garda file or files are presented to the office relating to the investigations the Garda has under way in the banking sector, can the Taoiseach assure Members that there will be no delay in the pursuit of or dealing with such files?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last matter raised by the Deputy, there has been close liaison between the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the investigating authorities and obviously they are a matter of major priority.  It is in the public interest that they are dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  Concern has been raised about the length of time it takes but there <Col N="3"/>is also a necessity to ensure there is due process and that nothing is said or done that would compromise the prospective prosecution of any persons arising from those investigations.  Taking all of that into account, there is no reason to believe that these matters will not be given the utmost priority.</P>
        <P>In regard to the savings in the Department, the Government, as I said, has already reduced its overall staff numbers by 10% since January 2008 and will continue to reduce numbers, while maintaining services, by a further 2% below the employment control framework target set by the Department of Finance by the end of 2014.  That is the reference point for that question.</P>
        <P>Since January 2008, some 35 staff have been redeployed to other departments and we will continue to facilitate actively the reallocation of staff to the areas of greatest need in accordance with the redeployment arrangements set out in the Croke Park agreement.  The total budget for the Department was reduced between 2008 and 2010 by 31%, including a reduction of 11% in the administration budget.  The administration budget Estimate for 2011 has been reduced by 15% over the 2010 Revised Estimate.  Further savings over the period of the plan will be achieved through continued efficiencies and procurement practices, greater use of technology and shared services, energy efficiency programmes, the use of central framework agreements and the close monitoring of all expenditure.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution, which was referred to by the Deputy, there is a pressing requirement for all public sector organisations to examine critically how they operate and seek to deliver greater efficiencies.  Like other public service organisations, the DPP is subject to the decision of the Government to restrict recruitment and promotions.  However, the office has taken steps to comply with the Government decision without adversely affecting front line prosecution services.</P>
        <P>We will continue to work with officials from the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions and the Department of Finance to ensure the necessary resources continue to be available to the DPP to enable it to fully and effectively discharge its function.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I note there is an allocation of &euro;6.7 million for the Moriarty tribunal for 2011, which is a slight reduction on what was provided in 2010.  Why is the allocation almost as high in 2011 as it was for 2010 if, as we have been told, it has now completed its public hearings?  When does the Taoiseach expect the tribunal to complete its work and present its report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are still working to the schedule which applied in the last correspondence we received from the judge.  We have received no correspondence since then that would change the situation.</P>
        <P>On the allocation within subhead D, the provision relates to the running costs of the tribunal in 2011 and the costs which are estimated to arise in 2011 in regard to the completion of the tribunal&rsquo;s work.  It is expected to include reporting costs and some element of the award of legal costs.  As it is not possible to assess definitively the amount of legal costs which may be awarded by the tribunal or the timing of these awards, provision of approximately &euro;6.7 million has been included.  However, this is an estimate only.  The total spend in 2010 to the end of November was &euro;2.545 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Did I hear the Taoiseach correctly when he said in the block of Votes relevant to his Department that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is included?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="4"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the comments made by the DPP, Mr. Hamilton, in respect of the difficulties his office is experiencing, if further savings are to be made there in 2011 can the Taoiseach confirm they will not be at the expense of it being able to deliver the service of which the DPP has spoken in the past?  Those services are necessary if we are to have fairness and transparency in the justice areas with which the DPP deals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said in response to the third issue raised by Deputy Gilmore when he was asking supplementary questions, we will work with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which is a public sector organisation.  The issues that apply to other offices, which are having to make these changes and adapt to these circumstances, also apply to the DPP&rsquo;s office.  The number of staff in the office&rsquo;s directing and solicitors divisions have remained relatively unchanged in the past two years.  Most of the savings have been made in the administration division.  This has allowed the office to achieve savings and efficiencies while preserving front line prosecution services to meet the needs of its workload.  The Department of Finance recently sanctioned the temporary recruitment of up to four solicitors to cover for staff on maternity leave in 2011.  It has also sanctioned the recruitment of three temporary solicitors to deal with files relating to the banking and financial sectors.  This will enable the DPP to assign existing experienced staff to the banking files, while using the temporary appointments to fill posts in other areas.</P>
        <P>These issues are arising all the time in the present circumstances.  The changes in staff numbers in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in recent years have taken place in the context of the solid staffing base that was put in place in the office in 2007.  Following a review of staffing requirements at that time, the Minister for Finance approved 28 new permanent posts and one contract post for the office.  Some 21 of those posts related to legal and professional grades, which was a reflection of the increase in the volume and complexity of the work being undertaken by the office.  Officials in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance are making an ongoing effort to work together to ensure the necessary resources are available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for that response.  The Director of Public Prosecutions made two important points.  He said that if the current trend continues, &ldquo;something will have to give&rdquo;.  He also said he is considering extending to serious cases of sexual abuse the facility available to him when people look for a reason a prosecution was not pursued in serious cases.  In his response, the Taoiseach outlined the number of staff who have been recruited in the legal and personnel sections of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in recent years.  Based on those figures, is the Taoiseach happy that something will not have to give?  In other words, if there is an increase in correspondence or contact with the office about the service it provides, is the Taoiseach reasonably happy that the office will be able to meet that demand?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have outlined the context of the situation as things stand.  Like any organisation, I am sure it would be helpful for this organisation if other staff were available.  We have to work within the constraints that apply to us all.  I recognise the importance of the independence of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We need to work in a realistic way to address certain issues.  As the Deputy is aware, these matters arise on an ongoing basis.  The office is working despite the reductions that have taken place, which have been primarily on the administrative side, as I have said.  The nature of the work done by the office means that administrative people are important, just as the staff in the professional and other grades are important.  Everyone has a job to do.  The office will have to try to work within the constraints <Col N="5"/>under which we are all having to operate without affecting its ability to do its job.  I am sure it is doing a very good job in difficult circumstances.  As I said in my opening reply:</P>
        <P LI="1">The outputs of the law offices are also demand-driven.  In addition to securing economies and increased operational efficiencies, the law offices have been exerting strong control in respect of expenditure on legal fees.  This will be continued in the coming years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is increased work.  There are substantial fees to be paid for that work.  One has to ensure it is paid for at rates that can be afforded by the taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Question No. 5 relates to the elements of the Government&rsquo;s national recovery plan which come under the Department of the Taoiseach or agencies under it.  Does the Taoiseach have any information in his brief on what those elements of the Government&rsquo;s national plan are in so far as they affect his Department or agencies under its control and the arrangements being made for those elements to be implemented? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has to play its part in achieving the overall expenditure reductions required by the National Recovery Plan 2011-14.  I was making the point that a large portion of the budgets of the offices under the group of Votes for which I have responsibility are administrative in character and, quite properly, have been taking reductions.  They are making a contribution as one might expect the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office to do in giving a leadership role in that respect.  Whatever has been sought has been delivered on. </P>
        <P>The delivery of front line services to the public will not be affected as a result of the introduction of the cost saving measures.  An action plan is in place to achieve that and to use the redeployment mechanism that is available where there are critical service pressures.  We have been able to contribute in that regard, with some 35 staff members from the Department of the Taoiseach being moved elsewhere where that was considered helpful.  The Department also continues to do the job it is expected to do.  There is a further 15% cut this year within the Department, so that is giving a lead as one would expect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether the Taoiseach has had the same opportunity as other Deputies in the interludes from this House at weekends to learn from constituents how they feel about the situation unfolding, particularly the first real outworking of the so-called national recovery plan, namely, the budget and the impact it is having already on the lives of ordinary people, along with all the other measure signalled from January to March, etc. </P>
        <P>I can share with him, however, my experience of the anger, concern and fear, the emotions most in evidence among the people I have met since the House adjourned last Friday.  For them, the so-called national recovery plan is, indeed, a national impoverishment plan so devastating is the effect it will have on their lives.  As he has indicated on a number of occasions here that &euro;14.5 billion has been taken out of the economy over the past two years, how does the Taoiseach rationalise that taking another &euro;15 billion out of the real economy over the next few years will make a difference when the first &euro;14.5 billion clearly has not impacted in any way in terms of turning the tide?  How is it that by doubling that figure and taking another &euro;15 billion out of the economy we are going to see a change, because none is evident?  Unemployment remains at a very high level and emigration is growing &mdash; hence the impact on the live register &mdash; in addition to the bank deficit debacle and the range of other issues presenting at this time.  None of this is being corrected, it seems, by any of the measures that have been taken so far.  How does the so-called national recovery plan impact in relation to the programme for Government?  What are the Taoiseach&rsquo;s views of the comments this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; by the Minister for Finance when he talked about silly post-election political prog<Col N="6"/>rammes?  In my view and that of many listeners, he was referring to the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party programme for Government after the last election.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the Minister that these were silly programmes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>All of us interact with the public on an ongoing basis, regardless whether one is at home or travelling throughout the country.   One of the big pluses is the degree of certainty it provides for people in terms of what is envisaged for the coming year.  The uncertainty before the budget and some of the commentary made upon it beforehand spooked people as to what was involved.  While it seeks a contribution from all sections of society, given the importance of putting our public finances back in order, it also provides us with the means for recovery, having stabilised the economy this year following a contraction of 7.5% the previous year.  The budgetary strategy for 2010 came in on target, with expenditure broadly within target and revenues up &euro;500 million on what was expected.  We still have a deficit.  In other words, the difference between what we spend and what we take in must be reduced.  </P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion, which is implicit in the premise of his question, that we can continue to implement budgets wherein the level of expenditure exceeds the level of revenue coming in is not possible in current circumstances in this or any other country.  The false option which the Deputy may be indicating is not available at all.  The recovery plan is predicated on reducing expenditure, increasing taxation and promoting growth.  That is what we will continue to do, as provided for in the plan.  On the suggestions put forward by the Deputy&rsquo;s party, I fundamentally disagree with them in terms of prospects for growth.  The suggestion that 80% of the &euro;15 billion could be made up from increased taxes would probably be the biggest jobs killer of all.  I do not agree either with the Labour Party suggestion that 50% of that sum should be raised by way of taxes, with the other 50% being raised by way of cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party recommended less tax cuts than the Government implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  The Labour Party suggested more tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government did more in relation to tax than we were recommending.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have read the Labour Party documentation.  I would have thought Deputy Gilmore had read the document presented by him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should read again what it says in regard to income tax.</P>

	<P>Bring it on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear what the Labour Party&rsquo;s tax take is, which is &euro;2.5 billion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is obviously encouraged by the media commentary on his defence of the indefensible here last week when he employed an old talent he had buried for some time, namely, his usual bluster.  While that may have given a bit of lift to Fianna Fail backbenchers, it has done absolutely nothing for the wider public or to assuage the real fears of Opposition voices in this House.  Contrary to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view that the question I posed implies &ldquo;sit still and everything will be fine&rdquo;, nothing could be further from the truth.  The Taoiseach has not answered any of the questions I put to him.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach referred to having read other parties documents.  Without question, I am confident that I can stand over the potential impact of the stimulus package we have commended in our recommendations.  The Government has not provided a stimulus package on job retention or creation.  The national impoverishment plan which the Government is outworking and under which it introduced with some trumpeting last week the first budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in not to lose sight of the fact that this is Question Time.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We are obviously going to disagree.  The sad reality is that the Taoiseach has again demonstrated a closed mind to other ideas because they come with respective party political tags, which is most regrettable.  I again ask the Taoiseach to reconsider the position he is taking because there is no evidence, despite what he has endeavoured to sell here this afternoon, that taking money out of the economy will arrest the decline and lead to recovery.  It cannot and will not.  I again ask the Taoiseach to respond to the reference by the Minister for Finance this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; to the programme for Government between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party as a silly post-election political programme.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That was not his position.  He was speaking generally about the roles of programmes for Government over the past 15 to 20 years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should allow the Taoiseach to continue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  If the Deputy would like my answer, I can give him an answer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

	<P>So would I.  I would love to see the Deputy trying to bring me into one.  All programmes for government are subject to the budgetary circumstances.  I refer him to every one of them, including the rainbow coalition programme and the Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Party programme.  All commitments in every programme are subject to overall budgetary requirements because, otherwise, there is no reality to them and that is why those provisions are in place in every programme.</P><Col N="8"/>
        <P>Second, the counterargument I am putting is the Deputy is saying the &euro;15 billion should be left in and we should run another deficit of &euro;18.8 billion next year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy, therefore, is saying he would not take this amount out.  If he will not take it out one way, what way will he take this out?  Is it going to be tax?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If Sinn F&eacute;in is not taking &euro;15 billion out in expenditure, is it taking it out in tax or is it taking it out at all?  Will it be taken out of one bank and put in another?  Is the party bringing it down somewhere else and putting it somewhere?</P>

	<P>That is for sure.  The Deputy should not worry about.  I will not contaminate the Deputy&rsquo;s group with my presence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the Deputy is saying we should leave the &euro;15 billion in, then one is talking about continuing with the deficits we have.  It is clearly the case that there is no access to funds available to this country on that basis and, therefore, by July 2011, when the Deputy goes up to Monaghan for his weekend sojourn after being in the House &mdash; if he is still here after the next election &mdash; he <Col N="9"/>will have to explain to his constituents how Sinn F&eacute;in will get them their social welfare payments even though we have suddenly run out of money but he will be able to say to them &ldquo;But do not worry, Sinn F&eacute;in has a plan&rdquo;.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I have outlined to the House on many occasions progress on the implementation of the OECD&rsquo;s 2001 report on regulatory reform in Ireland and the Government&rsquo;s 2004 White Paper on regulation.  The better regulation unit in my Department is tasked with driving and supporting key projects across Government.  In this context, it chairs the senior officials&rsquo; group on economic regulation which oversaw the preparation of the Government&rsquo;s statement on economic regulation.  Following the publication of that statement, I chaired the first meeting of the annual regulatory forum on 26 February last.  The regulatory liaison group has already met twice this year.</P>
        <P>Relevant Departments have been working closely with regulators in recent months to stress-test regulatory frameworks to ensure that they are sufficiently robust to be able to respond to major shocks and changes in their sectors and in the wider economy.  A number of potential scenarios have already been identified in the case of each sector and it is expected that the Government will receive a report on the stress testing exercises shortly.</P>
        <P>On 2 November last, the OECD published its Review of Better Regulation Systems and Processes in Ireland.  The report is available at <i>www.betterregulation.ie</i> and copies have also been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  The review was conducted as part of a larger project funded by the EU Commission and encompassing the original 15 members of the EU.  It provides a comprehensive analysis of regulatory capacity in Ireland and the processes underpinning it.  These processes include regulatory impact analysis, RIA; administrative burden reduction and approaches to the enforcement of regulation; and our approaches to the negotiation and transposition of EU legislation from a better regulation perspective.</P>
        <P>The OECD notes that, in many areas, Ireland compares well with its European counterparts but suggests that further efforts will be necessary to improve competitiveness and contribute to economic recovery.  Ireland&rsquo;s input into the recent EU Commission/OECD review was overseen by the senior officials group on economic regulation, which has now been tasked with developing appropriate actions to respond to the OECD&rsquo;s findings and recommendations.</P>
        <P>The better regulation unit has an ongoing role in supporting Departments conducting regulatory impact analysis on legislative proposals.  The importance of this function was highlighted by the OECD in its recent report.  While good progress has been made, it is clear there are still problems regarding the quality of RIAs produced by Departments and the extent to which Departments comply with RIA requirements relating to draft EU legislation and significant statutory instruments.  This will be among the issues which the senior officials group will look at as part of the response to the OECD&rsquo;s latest report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>These questions relate to the OECD report on better regulation.  Last night we saw on our television screens an example of no regulation.  The &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme showed horrific examples of the way in which home care companies are recruiting workers with no training, no Garda vetting and no checking of references.  It appears there is little or no inspection of what is taking place.  A policy decision by this Government to wind down services being provided through the public health authorities and the HSE <Col N="11"/>cut the amount of home help that is available to families caring for older people.  A new private sector in home care provision has developed which is not regulated and parts of it, as we saw last night, has serious questions to answer.  When will there be regulation of home care provision to deal with the horrific examples of abuse of elderly people which we saw on our television screens last night?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It sounds like a question for the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about regulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The supplementary documentation I have relates to the OECD report, which is a more general regulatory report.</P>
        <P>I did not see the programme last night but I am aware from reports about it that there are clearly issues which are unacceptable and must be investigated and examined closely.  The vast majority of services in this area are supplied by the HSE and HSE personnel but, as the Deputy said, a home care package programme has also been brought forward.  There are many reputable service providers in that area but clearly some are unscrupulous and have not done their job properly.  There is a commitment to look at this area, in respect of the public provision directly from the HSE and in respect of those who are involved in providing services through the private sector.  All of that will have to be examined as a matter of urgency and I welcome the fact that this will be done.</P>
        <P>In respect of the question on regulation, providing guidelines and making sure that standards and access to these services are more uniform across the country, I noted what the Minister of State with responsibility for elder people had to say this morning about guidelines coming forward in the New Year, as a result of much work done on the issue recently, and I look forward to those guidelines being brought forward quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is the huge gap between the theory and the practice.  We have an official report from the OECD dealing with regulation, and then we have what is happening on the ground at a practical level.  The reason we have the problem described so clearly last night on &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; is that this Government has made it more difficult for families to care for older people.  There have been reductions in home help provision and home help hours, and people have difficulties in getting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the &ldquo;foot in the door&rdquo; syndrome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  I also heard what the Minister of State had to say this morning.  She spoke about guidelines being introduced, but she was not able to say when the statutory regulation will be brought in.  I understand that some work is being done in preparing legislation.  Can the Taoiseach tell us when there will be statutory regulation of home care services?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are moving into specific territory, but to be as helpful as I can, I do not accept that the Government has been seeking to make it more difficult.  For example, the supervisory function of HIQA has been a good introduction for the health services in general and has led to a more objective uniform standard being provided.  There has been a great increase over time in the provision of home help and carers.  We are seeking to maintain front line services to the greatest extent we can, but there is a budgetary reality that we must try to deal with.  We certainly hope that these community based services can continue to be provided to the greatest extent possible.  I do not have that information in front of me now.  It is true that it has become more widely available, and that is a good thing.  There is obviously pressure <Col N="12"/>on budgets everywhere, given the current situation.  However, I believe that this level of provision will be as good as we have seen in recent years, as a result of efforts made in other areas to find savings.  That is as it should be.</P>
        <P>Entitlements for carers have remained for those who have other sources of welfare benefit, which was an innovation that was brought forward.  We brought about a situation that changed considerably from the previous administration where carer&rsquo;s allowance became the highest social welfare payment in the code.  These are all indications of the policies put in place that show we were trying to assist those people who are caring for their families, where it is appropriate, in community-based settings or home settings.  That is as it should be.</P>
        <P>Statutory regulation has to be examined as a matter of urgency.  Putting in place guidelines as a first step to invoking statutory policies needs to be done in any event.  In terms of an immediate response, whatever can be done as part of a wider approach of preparing statutory instruments and so on should be done.  The investigation by the HSE, which will cover everyone who is in receipt of such services and which will presumably take some time, should inform us about the best way forward.</P>
        <P>As Deputies know, the spectrum of need varies from case to case.  We started with basic home help services &mdash; good-neighbour type services &mdash; which were provided in a flexible way and were suitable for those who require care and their families.  We need to make sure there is proportionality in whatever we try to do.  We must provide the necessary protections, but let us not have a system that would prevent people from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>A minor filibuster.</P>
        <P>The OECD report published on 2 November, which was welcomed by the Taoiseach, stated: &ldquo;Regulatory as well as policy failures were a fundamental factor underlying the downturn&rdquo;.  Is the Taoiseach aware that in 2006 the same OECD stated in a report on house prices that the most likely scenario was that prices would level out or decline slightly?  In 2008, it went further and stated: &ldquo;Much of the exceptionally large increase in house prices can be justified by Ireland&rsquo;s strong income growth, population expansion and the rising share of younger households&rdquo;.  Clearly, there is a major discrepancy between the position of the OECD in 2006 and 2008 and its position in 2010.  Would the Taoiseach like to comment on that discrepancy and on the role of the OECD in helping to create an illusion, a mirage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think it played any role in creating an illusion or mirage.  What the Deputy&rsquo;s point shows graphically, as I have said myself on other occasions, is that international commentary in previous years did not foresee the scope, depth or severity of the financial crisis that came upon us in the autumn of 2008 and that we have been seeking to deal with since.  In the planning that was undertaken, such worst-case scenarios were not contemplated as something to be prepared for.  The OECD was not alone in that regard.  The IMF, which deals with situations of crisis in economies, whether fiscal or otherwise, itself did not include that scenario in its planning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It certainly did not.  The Taoiseach is quite right.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="13"/>
       <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Not very many people, if anyone, did.  There are many who, with hindsight, point to this, that or the other to suggest that they were saying it all along but that was certainly not the case in the years preceding the crisis.  There were risks but a confluence of the realisation of all of those risks was not regarded as being worthy of short odds.  The international and domestic problems that hit us subsequently were very severe and we are still contending with them.  The OECD was not on its own in saying that, and its having said that does not take away from other good work it has done, including the work we are considering in these questions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 30 together.</P>
	<P Just="Left"> As Deputy Feighan is aware, in the current economic circumstances we are faced with difficult decisions.  The Government has considered several measures in the context of the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 to provide the basis for a sustainable approach to the current financial situation.  Throughout Government, our approach has been to do this in as balanced a way as possible.  Taking into account the recent Supplementary Estimate and the full year funding associated with functions transferred into and out of the Department during 2010, gross funding for my Department is reduced by a total of 13% in 2011, current funding by 6% and capital funding by 28%.  Within this context, my primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the daily front line services provided with funding from my Department are protected, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities.</P>
        <P>In our current financial circumstances it is clear that objectives must be pursued with less resources than previously.  However, we will continue to strive to achieve good outcomes and value for money notwithstanding these constraints.  Every saving that can be made from cutting back on overheads will be pursued such that the urban, rural, Gaeltacht and island communities we serve retain, to the greatest extent possible, the services that have been developed in partnership with them over the years.  Different areas throughout my Department&rsquo;s Vote will experience different levels of adjustment next year.  For example, the reduction in current funding proposed under the national drugs strategy for my Department next year will be some 1.2% and I am confident that front line services provided in this area will not be adversely affected.</P>
        <P>In terms of rural development, the 2011 proposed allocation will provide for increased investment in the rural economy.  Significantly advancing the roll out of the Leader programme will be a key priority for the Department in 2011 and this is reflected in a substantially increased allocation for the programme next year.  The programme continues to play a key role in enhancing the economic potential of the rural community and in creating jobs and improving the quality of life in rural areas.  Overall, Deputy Feighan should note that details as to the manner <Col N="14"/>in which the funding will be allocated between various programmes will be published in due course in the Revised Estimates Volume.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>While overall the Department received a 13% cut in funding in the budget, some areas have been especially targeted.  Does the Minister accept there has been a 94% cut in the CL&Aacute;R programme, which provides funding for infrastructure in disadvantaged areas, and that the programme has been more or less abolished?  Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention to withdraw the programme entirely?  The budget allocation of &euro;500,000 does not represent a credible plan.</P>
        <P>The Minister is responsible for Cabinet co-ordination of the drugs strategy.  Will the Minister provide details of the cuts to drug funding made in all Departments?  Current spending is down 7%.  I realise the Minister stated this reduction is less for front line services but I am concerned that this amounts to juggling with figures.  What was the allocation under the national drugs strategy last year?  What will this figure be in 2011?  Is the Minister concerned with the current funding cut&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are several questions for the Minister to answer.  I will call the Deputy again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the overall spend, there is very little capital spending in our Department and, in some cases, little or nothing.  For example, an allocation of &euro;3 million was made in the capital budget under the national drugs strategy this year.  As it turned out, not all of that was used and some of it was transferred to current spending towards the end of the year to meet demands in that area.</P>
        <P>I refer to CL&Aacute;R funding.  For a variety of reasons, not least of which is the fact that local authorities have found it difficult during the past year to propose programmes that would qualify for CL&Aacute;R, a small amount of money has been left over.  Unfortunately, this will not be spent because local authorities and other community groups have been unable to access the matching funding.</P>
        <P>Spending in the subhead related to the drugs area has been reduced on the current side by between 1.3% and 1.7%.  I chose this course of action deliberately but the overall average cut or reduction has been approximately 2.7%.</P>
        <P>Both the local and regional drugs taskforces have been advised in the past week of their allocation for the coming year.  They are in discussions with the Department at the moment.  I have requested that any reductions which arise are made through further savings in the area of administration, overheads and travel.  The last place I wish to see further reductions is in services targeted at the front line, especially at vulnerable clients, such as those available in the drugs milieu.</P>
        <P>Current spending this year in the drugs area is &euro;32.79 million with &euro;1 million allocated to capital.  Although I do not have the precise figures, the comparison for last year was a reduction of approximately 2% overall in tacking the drugs problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>The budget was designed to be vague.  Many incendiary devices and booby traps will go off in the coming months.  Unfortunately, ordinary citizens must pay.  They do not understand what is coming down the line because the Minister has not highlighted or printed it.  Does the Minister not accept that if some moneys were left over from &euro;10 million, the 94% cut equates to &euro;9.5 million on the CL&Aacute;R scheme and surely that is grossly in excess of what was left over?</P>
       <P>The budget has been criticised as an especially anti-rural budget with cuts to rural transport, a hike in school transport costs, cuts to carers for the disabled and blind and cuts to CL&Aacute;R <Col N="15"/>and RAPID programmes.  Is the Minister concerned that this budget is effectively anti-rural and that people living in rural areas have been hit disproportionately by this budget?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no incendiary devices.  This project has been deliberately worked out and much of it was done in consultation with the sector.  Contrary to Deputy Feighan&rsquo;s remarks, the budget for rural communities has been, in fact, increased significantly for the coming year.  The outturn for this year is &euro;48 million and it will be &euro;60 million for the Leader programme next year.  A great deal of work can and is being done and will be done under this heading.  I do not agree with the remarks.  The Leader programme benefits not only mainland communities but the island communities.  Comhar na nOile&aacute;in and MFG are two Leader companies that do remarkably good work in this area.  I do not agree that anything approaching the level of reduction insinuated has been applied to rural communities.  The reverse is the case.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  further to parliamentary questions Nos. 141, 143 and 144 of 24 Samhain 2010, his views regarding the data supplied by the Health Research Board showing the high level of drugs use here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[46334/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>As indicated in my previous reply, the data to which Deputy Wall refers is primarily drawn from the 2010 annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, with the Health Research Board being the national agency through which the Irish input is channelled.</P>
        <P>For the reasons outlined, I emphasise the need for caution when using data to derive cross-European comparisons.  Also, the Irish input on heroin is based on a study published by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, NACD, in December 2009.  As indicated at the time due to several technical factors associated with the capture or recapture methodology used the figures were regarded as an overestimate of the opiate-using population here.  The NACD is currently undertaking research aimed at identifying an appropriate estimate model for use in Ireland, taking the data sources available into consideration.</P>
        <P>I accept that heroin use remains a major problem in our country.  All the indications are that, while the use of heroin is relatively stable in the Dublin region, it has become more widely dispersed throughout the country, especially in the major cities and in towns throughout Leinster.  The data under reference also emphasises the welcome increase in the number of people who are in receipt of treatment to deal with their drugs problems.  As I pointed out previously, new opiate substitution services have opened this year in Cork, Tralee and Wexford, and these will be followed shortly by facilities in Kilkenny, Waterford, Limerick, Dundalk and Drogheda.</P>
<P>Expansions of needle exchange services, detoxification facilities and rehabilitation services are also being implemented. While the Drugs Prevalence Survey 2006/07 showed an increase in cocaine use, the data is being updated at present with fieldwork for the Drugs Prevalence Survey 2010/11 being undertaken.  The initial outcomes from that survey will come to hand towards the end of next year.  Ireland ranks in the mid-range among the EU countries for cannabis use, while the use of ecstasy is considered to be at a low level.</P>
<P>I am confident that the steps being taken across the supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research pillars of the National Drugs Strategy will continue to impact significantly on problem drug use in Ireland. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I resubmitted this question because I believed the Minister&rsquo;s reply to my questions in November had watered down the extent of drug use.  When it is claimed figures given should not be taken as absolute, it still should not <Col N="16"/>take from the fact that use of drugs such as heroin, cocaine, cannabis, etc in Ireland is relatively high.  We saw how in the past several days the death of one person, a sad and unfortunate individual who was prominent in radio and television, led to reams of newspaper columns on the circumstances surrounding his death.  Accordingly, we must not water down the survey&rsquo;s results but highlight them to youngsters about the dangers of drug use.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister ensure a positive review is made of these figures for this purpose?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no intention of watering down any findings on drug use.  The drugs problem is serious.  Even if Ireland did not feature in any league tables, as far as I am concerned, any abuse of drugs is an abuse too much.</P>
        <P>The report, published on 10 November, states 55% of problem opiate users were in opiate treatment in 2007, the last year for which we have an estimate.  In Dublin, the average waiting time for a substitution treatment programme is between two weeks and six weeks.  Those living outside Dublin can wait between one month and two years.  Since I was appointed, I have concentrated on improving these times in Leinster with the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted from the report that up to 30% of those entering treatment reported injecting use, while 22% of new cases reported injecting drug use.  The proportion of injector cases has decreased since 2003, however.  In 2007, 74% of drug related deaths, such as overdose poisoning, were due to opiates alone or opiates in conjunction with other drugs.  There was a steady rise in heroin seizures between 2004 and 2007.  At its peak in 2007, there were 1,698 heroin seizures, while in 2009 it came to 1,455, a 14% reduction.</P>
        <P>The general population survey reported 1.7% of adults used cocaine in the year prior to the survey and that the percentage was higher among young adults, 3.1%, and men, 2.3%.  Ireland is ranked fifth highest in the EU for cocaine use.  In 2008, of those who entered treatment, up to 17%, 761 people, reported cocaine as their primary use.  What really must be examined for the future is the number of cocaine deaths which increased from ten in 2003 to 63 in 2007 while the number of seizures rose from 566 to 1,749.  However, it decreased significantly in 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>These are the figures we want in the public domain.  While the Minister has read them out here, I want to see them in every health centre, doctors&rsquo; clinic, GAA grounds and other public places to highlight the dangers of drugs.  Alternatives to drugs must be provided through better recreational facilities and so forth.  We have some hope if we can reduce the demand for drugs; if not, we will have a battle at all times.</P>
        <P>On several occasions in the House, I have raised the danger of cocaethylene, the chemical caused by mixing alcohol and cocaine.  Unfortunately, over the past several days we saw how this has emerged again.  However, the Department and other drug abuse agencies have not highlighted the danger of mixing alcohol and cocaine.  It is important those who use cocaine and mix it with alcohol are aware and warned of these dangers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Wall that this information should be provided in the public domain such as doctors&rsquo; surgeries.  Interestingly, when I recently launched a programme for a drugs taskforce I was informed it was all very fine having such information in doctors&rsquo; surgeries but it needs to be in places where young people recreate such as GAA clubs and so on.  It is all very fine for professional practitioners to have access to this information but an in-your-face approach is needed.  There are examples of effective uses of such an approach across the country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 41 together.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned earlier, the 20-year strategy on the Irish language was approved by Government at its meeting of 30 November.   It is intended to publish the final document next week and further information will be available at that time concerning the steps to be taken for its implementation.  The strategy has been developed in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy statement on Irish of December 2006, which affirmed the Government&rsquo;s support for the development and preservation of the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.  As discussions have gone on, I think the House is united on this.</P>
        <P>The objective of the strategy is to increase on an incremental basis the use and knowledge of Irish as a community language.  The strategy is the culmination of a process that involved widespread consultation with the public, key stakeholders and a cross-party Oireachtas committee.</P>
        <P>The strategy has a number of areas for action such as education, the Gaeltacht, family transmission of the language, public services and the community.  The implementation of the strategy will begin in 2011 when appropriate structures will be put in place and legislation brought forward in order to ensure the successful implementation of the strategy in a cost-effective manner over its 20-year time frame.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Whatever about the policy of Strait&eacute;is na Gaeilge, on which all parties are agreed, does the Minister agree that its implementation is now a top priority?  Is the Minister seriously stating it will be possible to implement all aspects of that policy when there are such huge cutbacks to the resources available to Roinn na Gaeltachta and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The latter bodies will have a certain responsibility in the implementation of this policy.  It will be an impossible task and this calls into question the Minister&rsquo;s seriousness and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the strategy at this late hour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a 20-year strategy, not a 20-week one.  Everybody is serious about this matter.  A unit has been established in my Department to co-ordinate the implementation of the strategy as soon as the final document is published.  Some &euro;1.5 million has been set aside in the coming year&rsquo;s Estimates specifically for rolling out the initial phases.  Whatever Governments are in office over that 20-year period will have to adhere to the strategy.  It is recommended that the Cabinet sub-committee on Gaeilge and the Gaeltacht will have a monitoring role in implementing the strategy, as will the D&aacute;il, and the Seanad if it is around.  To answer Deputy McGinley&rsquo;s question, I am convinced that it is possible to implement the 20 year strategy in full, but every Government will have to make a commitment.  The fact that parties on the other side of the House have taken ownership of the strategy reassures me that it will be possible.  </P>
        <P>Of course it will involve resources, year on year.  That is why resources will have to be committed to it.  I am advised that &euro;1.5 million will be sufficient to roll out the initial phases of the strategy.  There will be other parts to it.  The education sector will have to play a part in the strategy, as well as other Departments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concerns of Deputy McGinley.  A new strategy has been put in place but there is far less money to put it into effect.  Less money will be spent on the Irish language.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned a co-ordinating unit in his Department.  What powers will the unit have?  Will it merely consult with other Departments or has it powers to make sure the various recommendations of the strategy are put in place?  Will it simply be another harmless talking shop with no effective function?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I repeat that the strategy is a 20 year one.  The next couple of years will be frugal, but I am sure that whatever Government is in power will put in enough money to roll out the initial phases of the strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The unit is not a toothless talking shop.  It is headed by an official at director level.  She will be working with a team of people across the Department to ensure that the objectives of the strategy are implemented.  It will not be a toothless tiger.  It will make sure that the objectives are pursued and fulfilled across Departments.  An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga also has a role in this.  There will be a high level committee of senior civil servants and the Cabinet committee on Gaeilge and the Gaeltacht will be there also.  The implementation group is based in Furbo.  The senior officials group has been in place for some time and is working on the drafts of the strategy, and there is also the Cabinet Committee on Gaeilge and the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>Whether I am here or not, I will be disappointed if this approach is not continued.  I think it will be.  While the targets are ambitious, they are achievable.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  his views on the impact of the reduced allocations totalling &euro;9 million in 2011 across community development programmes and projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The adjustment to my Department&rsquo;s community development budget has been structured to protect front line services and supports at the expense of administration, overheads and ancillary costs.  While the overall adjustment will impact on some programmes, my Department will continue to prioritise front line services to the greatest extent possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of the Local and Community Development Programme, the Deputy should note that the 2011 funding allocation has been maintained at close to 2010 levels. The allocation to the programme for next year of &euro;63.5 million represents a cut of the order of 6% on the funding available last year.  I am confident that this will allow for the continuation of important support for people in disadvantaged communities and will allow for the key, essential, front line services delivered through the programme to be maintained for 2011.</P>
        <P>In order to protect the invaluable work being done at the coalface by community and voluntary groups, my Department will shortly commence a structured dialogue with the community and voluntary sector with the aim, <i>inter alia</i>, of ensuring that the impacts of any budgetary adjustments to the services provided by the sector are minimised, as far as possible.  To this end, my Department will be working with the sector to achieve greater consolidation, co-ordination and efficiencies among service providers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy may be aware, contracts under the scheme to support national organisations will finish at the end of this year, and I am pleased to note that a new scheme for national organisations has been developed and this will be advertised shortly. Funding under the old scheme will be extended on an interim basis &mdash; until March 2011 at the latest &mdash; to allow for the new scheme to be rolled out.</P>

	<P>The Minister and I are of one mind with regard to the need to protect front line services to the greatest degree possible.  The latter was my main concern in respect of tabling this question.  As the Minister is aware, there are hundreds if not thousands of small community groups throughout the country which are doing outstanding work, mainly on a voluntary basis.  Their efforts are being supported through an extremely small allocation of State funding.  I am keen that the enormous amount of voluntary work that is being done should continue.</P>
        <P>Having indicated that front line services will be protected to the greatest extent possible, is the Minister in a position to indicate the areas in which the &euro;9 million will be saved?  If he can provide clarity in that regard, I will be able to rest assured that the services to which I refer will be fully protected.  Will the relevant savings be made in the administrative or bureaucratic areas or in other areas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>In the interest of assisting Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, I am in a position to inform him that there are approximately 24,000 of the voluntary groups to which he refers.  As far as I am concerned, these are the most important groups of their kind, particularly in the context of the way they deliver front line services.  The relevant subhead also includes partner<Col N="23"/>ship and integrated companies and covers a range of areas and significant funding has already been allocated in respect of it.  I have informed the organisations that reductions will have to be made in the areas of administration, overheads, the printing of glossy brochures, the holding of fancy launches, travel, etc.  In addition, they will be obliged to consider salary comparisons across the sector.  It is in these areas that savings can be achieved.  From my contacts with the organisations in question, I am convinced that such savings will be made.</P>
        <P>There are 22 volunteer centres throughout the country and these do extremely good work.  I am anxious to continue to provide support to these centres.  The Department also supports 64 of the larger national organisations and a new scheme relating to these will be advertised and rolled out in the coming year.  Most of what is happening at present will continue to happen.</P>
        <P>Members will be aware of what has taken place this year in the context of the integration of community development projects into the local companies.  In most cases, work in this regard has proceeded in a reasonable manner.  I am under no illusions but that there has been some pain involved at a local level.  However, the vast majority of the community development projects are well on their way to being integrated.  There may be a small number in respect of which additional time may be required for such integration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister indicate how the consultation process will operate, particularly in light of the large number of groups and projects involved?  Will officials from the Department be handling the process or does the Minister propose to appoint consultants?  How long will it take for the consultation process to be completed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The structured dialogue I referred to earlier was suggested by those within the sector.  In some respects, it flows from what took place in the social partnership process over many years whereby the social partners and the Government would engage with each other.  The Department is proposing to develop, in conjunction with those in the sector, draft papers.  This process will facilitate and enable the discussion to take place.  I am of the view that the consultation process should not be too lengthy.  The basis for agreement is about right and most people are aware of what we want to try to achieve, namely, a more equal and more healthy society in which individuals feel they have a role to play.</P>
        <P>We want to build on the strengths that already exist.  I was not being frivolous when I stated that there are 24,000 voluntary groups throughout the country.  These groups are both large and small, some of them are extremely ineffective while others are great at what they do.  During the recent two-week period of bad weather, these groups came from nowhere to provide assistance.  They operate under the radar but they were there when the cold snap arrived.  We must try to ensure that we get the best out of these groups.</P>
        <P>I must admit that I obtained the idea for this consultation process from the neighbouring island, where the structured dialogue with the voluntary sector has been quite successful.  As long as I hold office and am in a position to exert any influence, the objective of the process will be to develop in this country a civic society that will make a difference.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  his views on recently published Central Statistics Office figures on poverty; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[46069/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The annual survey on income and living conditions, SILC, published by the CSO is the official source of data on national poverty indicators, such as at-risk-of-poverty, material deprivation and consistent poverty.  The SILC poverty figures for 2009, published on <Col N="24"/>25 November last, provide the first indications of the impact of the economic crisis on living standards and poverty levels.  The at-risk-of-poverty rate was 14.1%, a decrease from 14.4% in 2008.  The fact that the at-risk-of-poverty rate did not increase and, despite the rise in unemployment, actually fell slightly highlights the key role of social transfers in ensuring minimum living standards in times of economic difficulty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The consistent poverty rate of 5.5% in 2009 is a slight increase from the 2008 level of 4.2%.  While disappointing, this trend must be seen in the context of the continuous decline in consistent poverty since 2003, when the rate was 8.2%.  The 2009 rate is comparable to the 2007 figure of 5.1% and is lower than the 2006 rate of 6.5%.  The long-term trends in regard to consistent poverty indicate that the Government&rsquo;s poverty reduction target, set out in the national action plan for social inclusion 2007 to 2016, remains on track.  In fact, the 2009 SILC results show some vulnerable groups such as older people have a consistent poverty rate of 1.1%, which is below the interim target of a 2% to 4% consistent poverty rate by 2012.</P>
        <P>In meeting the current economic challenges, the Government is committed to prioritising those who are the most vulnerable and to protect, as far as possible, front line services in marginalised communities.  The overriding objective now is to restore economic growth and maximise employment in order that the recent progress made in tackling poverty can be continued and that the goals in the national action plan for social inclusion regarding an inclusive and fair society can be achieved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the fact that 443,000 people are currently unemployed, does the Minister accept that if the survey were carried out now or early in the new year, when the budget cuts will take effect, the results would be altogether different?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The impact of this year&rsquo;s budget will be apparent in the near future.  I would not like to anticipate what will be the outcome in this regard.  However, what emerges will obviously inform the process of policy formation in the months ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister admit that the recent budget and the policies outlined in the Government&rsquo;s national recovery plan will do nothing to alleviate the situation and will only serve to increase the gap between high earners and those who are struggling to cope on a daily basis?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The findings currently available indicate that each of the budgets from 2008, including that introduced last week, have been very progressive.  In other words, those who are in a position to pay most are being obliged to do so and those on lower incomes are being protected as far as is possible.  The ESRI reports that have been published since I entered the Department indicate that all groups, particularly the elderly, have benefited significantly from social transfers.  When issues relating to family income supplement, entitlement to medical cards, etc., are factored into the equation, there will be a better indication of the impact of the recent changes on particular groups.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Have the Minister or any of his Government colleagues been involved in discussions regarding the plight of voluntary organisations as Christmas approaches?  Will funding be provided for these organisations in order that they might provide assistance to people who have fallen into poverty?  Groups such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are pleading for funding so that they might try to attempt to deal with the crisis that exists.  I was informed about one instance where the amount being paid out by a particular group rose from &euro;5,000 to &euro;50,000 in one week.  What will the Government do to provide solace to such groups through the provision of funding as Christmas approaches, given that the Christmas bonus has been <Col N="25"/>done away with?  The opposite to that is that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is paying this now instead of the Government.  Have there been discussions to alleviate this position?</P>

	<P>While virtually all charities certainly will state they are under pressure, I can confirm to the House that for quite a number of years, my Department has been giving assistance to the bigger charities, some of which were named by the Deputy.  Moreover, only today I approved the payment of further moneys to the same organisations that have been funded heretofore to address the issues that are arising and have arisen previously.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 63 together.</P>
        <P>Allocations to most subheads in my Department&rsquo;s Vote will be reduced by varying amounts in the budget, as is the case in all Departments.  In the current economic circumstances, we are faced with difficult decisions.  The Government has considered a number of measures in the context of the National Recovery Plan 2011-14 to provide the basis for a sustainable approach to the current financial situation.  Across the Government, its approach has been to do this in as balanced a way as possible.</P>
        <P>Within this context, my primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the daily front line services that are being provided with funding from my Department are protected, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities.  In the prevailing financial circumstances, it is clear that objectives must be pursued with fewer resources than previously.  However, I will continue to strive to achieve good outcomes and value for money, notwithstanding these constraints.</P>
        <P>Every saving that can be made from cutting down on overheads and administration will be pursued.  This is to ensure that the range of urban, rural, Gaeltacht and island communities served by my Department will retain, to the greatest extent possible, the services that have been developed in partnership with them over the years.</P>
     
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not provided on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">My Department will shortly commence a structured dialogue with the community and voluntary sector with the aim, <i>inter alia</i>, of ensuring that the impact of any budgetary adjustments on the services provided by the sector are minimised, as far as possible.  To this end, my Department will be working with the sector to achieve greater consolidation, co-ordination and efficiencies among service providers.</P>
        <P>As Deputies may be aware, contracts under the scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector will finish at the end of this year.  In this regard, I am pleased to confirm that a new scheme has been developed and will be advertised in the coming <Col N="26"/>weeks.  To this end, my Department recently wrote to the organisations funded under the current arrangements to advise them that interim funding will be provided to them for a limited period, that is, to 31 March 2011 at the latest.  This will allow for the submission and assessment of applications under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of any discussions of the nature referred to with officials from the EU or the IMF.</P>
 </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow supplementary questions now in order to get in two such questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister has stated, obviously the front line services are of greatest concern.  While I am sure it is his intention, I ask the Minister to ensure there is no loss of employment or service.  In circumstances in which the unknown provides problems in this regard, I ask that the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs should consider individual cases.  I do not suggest this should apply to everyone because there have been cutbacks.  However, there have been instances in which an unknown development has led to major problems in respect of a particular group.  In such circumstances, the door should remain open in respect of considering the provision of funding to avoid the removal or reduction of, or damage to, front line services.  In such circumstances, I seek the goodwill of the Minister and the Department.  However, the same must be said in respect of the individual groups, namely, it is not simply a case of an open door but that this should be addressed in specific and special cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief although there is much that could be said on this question.  Does the Minister agree that the cuts made to the community and voluntary sector during the economic crisis have been grossly disproportionate?  Moreover, the culmination of the combined cuts from last year and this year is that there will be quite a high number of job losses in the sector.  Does the Minister agree that the estimated value to the economy from this sector is approximately &euro;6.5 billion and that this value represents a return to the State of more than &euro;2 million?  This means that one will get a return if one invests in this sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Deputy Wall, I would like to think that my Department has a good relationship with his client groups, be it the approximately 480 groups in the drugs sector, the community projects, the Leader companies and so on.  The officials have a record of being quite responsive to the needs of communities, including, as I always stress, the need to address emerging needs.  It is the known unknowns or the unknown knowns, whichever term one might use.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, I accept there have been significant reductions in spending in this particular sector in recent years.  However, I set out, with some success, in this year&rsquo;s budget to keep to an absolute minimum any reductions in this regard.  As I have stated in replies to other questions, any savings that can be made in administration, overheads and so on must be made to protect front line services.  A significant amount of resources still are devoted to the community sector and one should not underestimate the impact that such funding has on the ability of those groups to carry out their programmes.</P>

	<P>Before moving onto Leaders&rsquo; Questions and to advise the House, Members will be aware that a new Technical Group has been formed.  Before we take Leaders&rsquo; Questions today, since the designated leader of the Technical Group is now included I thought this would be an opportune time to remind Members of the procedure under Standing Order 27, which provides for those questions.  Leaders&rsquo; Questions are confined to the leaders of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and now the designated leader of the Technical Group, or in their absence, their respective designated deputy leader.  Each leader has two minutes for his or her opening question and one minute for a subsequent supplementary.  The Taoiseach has three minutes for the opening reply and one minute for the reply to each supplementary.  The overall time allowed is 21 minutes.</P>

	<P>I welcome that the Minister for Finance, on what appears to have been a solo run, has put an end to the payment of &euro;40 million in bonuses to senior bankers in AIB.  I do not welcome that on a &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme, Ireland was exposed last night to a series of incidents of indignity, inhumanity and unchristian and uncaring activities.  A number of years ago, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd used freedom of information legislation to expose the position that applied in the Leas Cross nursing home, as it then was, and a number of others.  The &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme broadcast last night exposed rottenness at the heart of Irish society.  While this may well be relevant to a minority of carers, it was a sickening episode of inhumanity to elderly persons and was something that could happen to anyone or to everyone&rsquo;s mother in such a situation.  This is not what the Taoiseach wishes to see, nor what this House wishes to see and it is not something with which Ireland should be obliged to put up.</P>
        <P>I would not mind but the impact of the programme was quite devastating for many people.  There were images of an elderly person being force fed in 2010, which is an unacceptable practice.  Persons who were not vetted, trained or used to administering drugs or food in its various forms to elderly people were visiting the private homes of elderly people.  There were uncaring attitudes, where elderly people who were still able to do things for themselves were not allowed to do so.  It is a modern-day form of human imprisonment of the worst type.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach has been an advocate of the things he has done in government and how he has conducted its business.  He said on more than one occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Deputy, I am afraid I have a note on the time for Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s note on the time.  Time is short for the elderly people in question.  </P>
        <P>I note the Taoiseach&rsquo;s many responses about acting in accordance with the best advice available to him.  The Law Reform Commission made recommendations on regulation of the industry in October 2009.  The NESF report, of which I have a copy, stated the same, namely, that regulation was absolutely necessary in situations like this.  The Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Brady, said she expected to introduce regulations in this area early in 2010, almost a year ago.</P><Col N="29"/>
        <P>This is an intolerable practice which has to be ended.  In view of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s many comments that his Government acts on the best advice, what is his explanation as to how the situation has been allowed to develop to intolerable and inhuman levels?  What are we doing in so-called Christian Ireland in 2010?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to point out that the programme, which I did not see, that was broadcast last night alleged that the lack of regulation in the home care sector leaves the recipients vulnerable to abuse.  I understand four cases were highlighted.  It is important to point out that any individual case where less than professional and caring services are provided is something which nobody in a position of responsibility would stand over.  Therefore, there has to be a full investigation by the managers of the services in the HSE into all of these areas and a review must take place in order that they can confirm that clients who are in receipt of these services at local level are obtaining those services in a way that we all would expect.</P>
        <P>There are a range of services available in community settings for people who require them.  They include home helps, meals on wheels, day care, respite care and home care packages, as they are known.  The majority of these are provided by the HSE and some by the voluntary or private sectors.  Provision is in place for any complaints to be dealt with.  A helpline which was set up this morning as a result of the programme received approximately 54 calls by noon, nine of which related to complaints that clients or their families had, which will be followed up.  That complaints procedure is available to everyone who wishes to use it.</P>
        <P>Regarding the question of making sure that a uniform level of care or access to services are provided, the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Brady, has indicated that work has been continuing on this.  In the new year the publication and implementation of national guidelines and procedures for the standardised implementation of the home care packages scheme and quality guidelines for home care support services for older people will be available, which we would all welcome.  It is important that those guidelines and standards are proactively promoted.</P>
        <P>There are members of the Home Care Association against which no particular case was impugned.  People are providing a good service.  However, anywhere, any instance or any day where people are treated with less than the dignity that we would expect for our people is not welcome or acceptable.  The standards of care need to be of the highest professional standards at all times.  The review that is being undertaken will assist in that.</P>
        <P>Approximately 9,500 people are in receipt of home care packages at any one time, and 13,000 are in receipt of it annually.  Some 80,000 people use more than 21,300 day care and respite care places in our system.  Some 54,000 people are in receipt of help under the home health scheme, where hours of care are provided by neighbours and others.  Given the spectrum of care available and the need that varies from individual to individual we need a flexible, proportionate response to make sure that people are being cared for and that neighbourliness is being encouraged.</P>
        <P>Many people who are still in a community care setting require high standards of care and are attended by district public health nurses, others and people in the area we are discussing.  The standard of professional care that we expect is of the highest level at all times and any digression from that must be dealt with and investigated thoroughly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Taoiseach for his explanation as to why the recommendations made by expert bodies have not been followed through.  He said no one can stand over this situation, the Minister of State will carry out a review and there will be a full inquiry &mdash; whether it is public or whatever &mdash; in respect of what we saw last night.</P><Col N="30"/>
        <P>In September 2009 the NESF report was released which made it very clear what should be done.  In October 2009 the Law Reform Commission reported in the same way.  In November 2009 the absent Minister of State with responsibility in this area said she would introduce guidelines as early as possible in 2010.  We are now told that, a year on, she will do something in the spring.  What is the explanation of the Government as to why this has not happened?</P>
        <P>I contrast the situation with the fact that the Government is prepared to write a cheque, irrespective of the amount, for banks.  We rushed through nursing home legislation in 2006 to take almost &euro;1 billion from elderly people.  The legislation in respect of the bank guarantee scheme was rushed through.  Legislation will be rushed through tomorrow in respect of credit institutions dealing with bank restructuring.  However, there is no urgency about the most vulnerable, deprived and sensitive in our society, namely, those people who are of elderly and venerable years who, in these cases, were demonstrated to be the victims of inhumanity and a downright lackadaisical approach.</P>
        <P>I have a letter from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dated 13 October 2008 which refers to an application made by an eligible group for vetting in order to work with elderly people.  Nobody has been vetted, two years on, to work with the elderly people in question.  It is another symptom of the situation whereby people with no training or regulation are visiting elderly people.  In view of that fact, is the Taoiseach prepared to be big enough to apologise to the elderly people concerned for the situation which has occurred on the watch of his Government, where neither regulation nor care has been practised in the cases evidenced in the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This House would be unanimous in its concern about any digression from the highest standards of care one would expect, particularly for people who are elderly or vulnerable, people who are part of the mental health services and people living in community care settings.  I would apologise to any family &mdash; I understand four cases were highlighted &mdash; for any digression from the standard of care which we are all entitled to expect.  Of course that is the situation.  It is not a question of being big enough or small enough to apologise.  It is a question of this behaviour not being justified in any case, regardless of the number of people who are receiving proper care, thankfully.  I do not accept the opening remark made by the Deputy &mdash; it was obviously geared more towards the headlines &mdash; to the effect that we are rotten to the core as a society.  I do not accept that.</P>

	<P>I accept that in any individual case that arises, such as the four cases that arose in this programme, a review is required.  Some 65,000 people are in receipt of this range of services in the community.  We want to see all of those reviewed.  I do not refer to a full inquiry in the sense of a public inquiry.  I am talking about a full review.  Where problems arise, as they do from time to time when clients and families are less than satisfied with the level of service being provided in individual cases, those complaints are dealt with and arrangements are made for other providers and other people to come into those homes.  I refer to what <Col N="32"/>happens when families make the point that they are less than happy with the level of service, or perhaps with the person who is providing the service.</P>

	<P>There is no central monitoring of any complaints.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That has happened on many occasions.  Obviously, such concerns have to be accommodated where they are justified, or where it is reasonable for people to make that case.  We need to take on board the lessons that are to be learned in this case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We should not jump to the conclusion in all circumstances, or in all cases, that this is symptomatic of something that is systemic throughout the system.  I do not intend to resile from my personal belief, which is that those who receive services, regardless of how they are provided, must at all times have the requisite dignity and care demanded by a professional approach.  I refer to vulnerable and elderly people, in particular.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We all have members of families who have had the benefit of these services over the years.  I am sure the majority of cases represented in this House, as elsewhere, would reflect that view as well.  In no way should it dilute our sense of duty to those to whom that standard was not applied, as made evident in last night&rsquo;s programme.  It is clear that a full and comprehensive review of all such cases must be conducted by local managers to ensure a situation like that which we saw last night is neither prevalent nor continuing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>They do not examine them now.  That is the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>During Taoiseach&rsquo;s questions earlier this afternoon, I asked the Taoiseach about last night&rsquo;s episode of &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo;, which showed the cruel, abusive and inhuman treatment of vulnerable elderly people and the lack of regulation of this area.  These problems have resulted from the Government&rsquo;s determination to privatise home care services.  I intend to return to the subject on the Order of Business proper.</P>
        <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach about the letter the Minister for Finance has written to Allied Irish Bank, which purports to stop the payment of &euro;40 million in bonuses to executives of the bank.  The Government was shamed into sending the letter.  It originally told us nothing could be done for legal reasons.  It said it would deal with the matter by taxing future bonuses.  The Government then said it would examine the matter again.  Eventually, the Minister for Finance wrote the letter.  I suppose it is a case of better late than never.  The issue that arises is whether it might be too late.  The Minister for Finance has acknowledged that the letter cannot stop the payment of the bonus to Mr. Foy, who took the legal challenge against AIB.  The challenge was not contested by AIB.</P>
        <P>I have been told that proceedings have been already started in at least 90 other similar legal challenges.  Will the letter sent by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, prevent the payment of bonuses to the 90 people who are involved in those cases?  Can the Taoiseach explain why the letter was not sent at an earlier stage?  The Government had a number of opportunities to take a position of this kind.  It could have done so when the legislation on the guarantee was being dealt with in 2008.  I remind the House that the legislation provided that terms and conditions, relating for example to remuneration and bonuses, would be attached to the guarantee.  Why was the letter not sent when the original recapitalisation of AIB, in the original amount of &euro;3.5 billion, was brought forward by the Government?  When did the Government <Col N="33"/>first become aware that these bonuses were to be paid?  When was it informed that legal action had been initiated?  When was it informed that a judgment &mdash; to the effect that a bonus was to be paid in Mr. Foy&rsquo;s case &mdash; had been made without contest?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Deputy Gilmore that efforts were made in this matter in November 2010, after a final judgment was granted or entered in the case he mentioned.  Earlier this month, after the recapitalisation of the banks had been agreed in the agreements with the IMF and the EU, the Minister was able to find a means, through the letter he provided, of making it clear to the bank directors that they would be acting in the best interests of the bank if they were to accede to his view.  He made it clear that although there was no requirement for them to obtain his prior consent, which could not be conferred or inferred in respect of any decisions they might take on the matter, they would have his consent.  It was not required.  This approach provided a legal basis upon which the bonuses may not be paid, or would not be paid.  Whereas the judgment in the case of Mr. Foy is a matter of a court order and has to be paid, my understanding is that the other cases which are in process have not yet been paid.  It is important for us to deal with this matter as expeditiously as possible, therefore, to provide as much legal justification as possible for the decision we are seeking to have effected, which is that these payments will not be made.  I understand that in October 2010, AIB informed the Department that 91 employees had initiated legal proceedings in either the Circuit Court or the High Court, depending on the individual amounts involved, with the first case scheduled for 3 November 2010.  It is clear that the employees in question are the people to whom this set of proceedings relates.  As Members are aware, the liberty to enter a final judgment from the Master of the High Court in respect of the individual concerned was done in November 2010.  I do not have a date for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The position, as I understand it and as the Minister for Finance has been communicating it, is that he has told Allied Irish Banks that if it proceeds to pay these bonuses, the bank will not benefit from the taxpayers&rsquo; money the State intends to put into the bank.  That is a position we would all support, but my question is whether it will work.  The Minister has already acknowledged that it cannot affect the bonus in the case that has already been through the court and where the award has been made.  The Taoiseach says there are 91 other cases in which legal proceedings have started.  My advice is that, according to the Buckley case in 1950, the Oireachtas or the Executive cannot intervene or supervene &mdash; the word now being used by the Minister &mdash; in a case which has already commenced.  If that is the case, while the Minister has sent his letter, bonuses will still have to be paid. </P>
        <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer earlier has not clarified the position for me.  Are we in a situation where the Minister is shutting the door after the bonuses have bolted?  While he has finally taken action after all the publicity, are we not in a situation where it will not do the trick?  Given that he did not do this when the guarantee legislation was going through the House, when the original recapitalisation was being done or when he found out that the bank was considering paying the bonuses, and although the letter is written and the threat made, are we in fact in a situation where, as this works its way out, we will find that the bonuses will end up having to be paid?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is not correct in his assertions.  This was a pre-2008 event, as he knows, and took place before the crisis.  It was an existing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It was 2009 when it took place. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right, when the payments were being made.  The issue had been deferred from 2008 into 2009 and was continuing to be deferred because obviously there was <Col N="34"/>some debate as to whether the payment could be avoided.  However, the legal advice was to the effect that it had to be paid, and there were some 1,460 employees who had chalked up aggregate bonus awards to the tune of around &euro;35.5 million.  Therefore, the issue of the 91 employees is not the same as the 1,460, which is the total number. </P>
        <P>The supervening issue being referred to by the Minister was such that he was indicating to the bank that if it was to go ahead and pay these bonus awards, it would be putting at risk the State money to be provided under the recapitalisation programme.  Therefore, the directors of AIB took a unanimous decision that it was in the best interests of the bank, given that series of events, not to proceed with the bonus awards, despite the legal advice the bank had been given.  This was the basis on which that decision was taken by the bank and it is the basis upon which we are now proceeding.</P>
        <P>This decision was the result of continuing efforts over the weekend, following political discussions and advice on whether there was a way this matter could be resolved so that the taxpayer would not have to provide money for this purpose, despite the fact that there were pre-existing contractual arrangements in place.  Therefore, as was said by the Minister this morning, this is difficult territory in legal terms, but we believe this is the means by which we can ensure that bonus payments are not paid, and to do so in a way that withstands legal scrutiny.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you at the outset for the opportunity to address the issue highlighted in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last evening, that is, the disgraceful treatment of elder citizens by so-called home care providers, under the matters selected for the Adjournment. </P>
        <P>Tomorrow, the Taoiseach will seek the endorsement of the D&aacute;il for the Government&rsquo;s sell-out deal with the IMF.  I know he will deny it, but I believe this debate and vote is taking place as a result of letters issued on my behalf by solicitors to both the Offices of the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General last week, demanding that this opportunity be provided to Members of this House under Article 29 of the Constitution, and that this be acceded to by Government by the close of business today.  Otherwise, I would have reserved the opportunity to take whatever action I deemed necessary, including legal action.  I know the Taoiseach will deny this, but that is my belief and it is the backdrop to what we are looking at tomorrow.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach recall the same IMF in its financial systems stability assessment update of 2006, stating: &ldquo;Good progress has been achieved in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework.&rdquo;  How well did it examine the situation then obtaining before it made that claim?  Let us make no mistake: the birds of prey trio, comprising the IMF, the ECB and the EU, have been cheerleaders all along through the Celtic tiger years and have been encouraging endless borrowing.  They have been applauding direct tax reductions and avoidance and they now have their claws deeply embedded in our economic and political future.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that it is time to clip their nails and send them back from whence they came?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Make no mistake, personable and all as Mr. Ajay Chopra can be, we do not want a new lord-lieutenant here in Ireland.  We have history books full of those experiences.  We want to retain whatever last vestiges of our economic sovereignty and independence we have, and we can have that.</P>

	<P>I have already asked two questions, a Cheann Comhairle, and I will ask a few more.  The IMF is the body to which the Taoiseach wants to sell out the remaining economic sovereignty we have in this State.  Will he not now grasp the opportunity in this eleventh hour moment and not proceed with this shameful deal, given that the IMF&rsquo;s board has itself decided to postpone the final sign-off, consequent to the fact that we are going to debate this matter and vote on it here in the House tomorrow? </P>
        <P>As a citizen and elected representative, I have the right to demand this, but I am appealing to the Taoiseach not to proceed with these actions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy give way to the Taoiseach, please? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concluding with this.  I am appealing to him not to burden this and future generations with a bank bailout debt created by the gamblers who gambled on Anglo Irish Bank and other corrupt banks, and who lost.  I am asking&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>Will he heed the cry of the people and those who are already hurting in our society as they say, &ldquo;This is not our debt &mdash; we did not take this gamble&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the motion being tabled tomorrow is to ensure there is full certainty regarding the views of this House, as expressed last week by a majority in its support for the first instalment of this four-year recovery plan through the passing of the budget.  The purpose is to demonstrate that there is no uncertainty about the fact that this House, representative of the Irish people, is anxious to ensure that we bring the funding certainty to this State over the next three years that this programme will provide. </P>
        <P>The request from Sinn F&eacute;in Members that we not do so suggests that they have some funding mechanism in mind.  If they could let us know what that is, we would be glad to hear from them.  However, it would surprise me if the funding mechanism was such that it would have that amount of money available.  Let us wait and see.</P>
        <P>The real issue is that for this country to rule itself for the next three years, we need to have funding available to deal with the deficits we are reducing over time in a manner that seeks to protect to the greatest extent possible the social and economic gains of the past.  To do that there has to be certainty and stability, and that is what this programme provides for us.  Those prospects are available.  The only alternative mechanism I am aware of for the provisions of funds for the sovereign would be from the markets, which we are not in at present.  If we were to seek to obtain money from those markets, it would be at far higher rates than what is available under the agreements for discussion and decision tomorrow.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Will the Taoiseach not accept that the alternative is that we should not be paying this bank bailout debt and that, if it is the case that the Sinn F&eacute;in propositions fall in any way short in terms of current spending, we would be infinitely better off going to the open market and paying additional percentages for a much smaller sum of money, thus retaining our control, self-determination and sovereignty in relation to our economic <Col N="36"/>future?

	<P>I am asking the Taoiseach how he can reconcile the prediction by his Government in the so-called national recovery plan &mdash; a national impoverishment plan, as I referred to it earlier &mdash; that there will be 5% GDP growth between 2010 and 2012 with the EU Commission prediction of 2.8% growth, that consumer spending will increase by 1% when the Commission claims it will decrease by 2.8% and that there will be an increase in employment by 18,500 and the Commission&rsquo;s prediction of a further decrease in employment of 4,000?</P>

	<P>How does the Taoiseach reconcile these widely divergent views and predictions in regard to the future, and with a body with whom the Government is entering into a fixed deal for many years to come?  I ask that the Taoiseach take the opportunity to talk to his advisers and to listen to the alternative views, if not from the political parties lined up in this Chamber, to the other non-politically aligned views being expressed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">What I cannot reconcile in terms of their logic are the two propositions I have just heard from Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  The first proposition is that we ignore sovereign debt markets from whom we have obtained the money and default on the debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we are talking about bank bailouts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The second proposition was that I should not ignore EU Commission forecasts on growth, employment and other economic indices and should reject my own.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked how the Taoiseach reconciled them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The first series of questions were a call to Irish sovereignty and the second series were that the Government should ignore our own opinions and take on board someone else&rsquo;s.  The illogicality of what the Deputy says is self-evident.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom an D&aacute;il a chur ar athl&oacute; chun an cheist r&iacute;-th&aacute;bhachtach seo a phl&eacute;, namely, the need for the Government to bring forward legislation to properly regulate shops offering cash for gold, which shops seek to take advantage of the economic circumstances of the least well off and are leading to an increase in burglaries as thieves target jewellery now more than ever.  I am aware of an increase in burglaries in my own constituency in respect of which jewellery has been the target.  The burglars are specifically targeting the elderly and people living alone as they are considered easy prey.  This is becoming a bigger issue as we approach the Christmas period.  The prevalence of these shops in particular areas, often on a short time basis only, exacerbates the problem.</P>

	<P>It is not agreed.  The Labour Party cannot agree to the Order of Business.  It is not unusual in the final sitting week before the Christmas break that the Government would seek to use the guillotine and ram through many proposals but, by any standards, what is proposed for this week is extraordinary.  Today a social welfare Bill is to be passed by 9 p.m. and the Government has produced 30 pages of Report Stage amendments for that Bill.</P>

	<P>Tomorrow we have been told we will have a vote on the memorandum of understanding relating to the agreement between the Government and the IMF and the European institutions.  We have not yet been supplied with the text of the motion, which we are to debate tomorrow.  Four hours are also being allocated tomorrow to deal with complex legislation on banking, the Bill for which was only circulated earlier today.  It runs to more than 70 sections dealing with complex banking issues.  It was supplied to the Opposition parties at lunchtime and we are expected to debate it, consider it and tease it out in four hours tomorrow.  This shows no respect for this House.</P>
        <P>I am struck by the irony of the fact that the IMF decided to postpone its decision on the approval of the IMF-EU deal out of respect for the Irish parliamentary process.</P>

	<P>The only people who are not showing respect to the Irish parliamentary process are the Government parties in the context of the volume of business they want to do in a short time, the fact that they are not providing notice or documentation and legislation on time to the Opposition parties and then giving us minimal time to debate them.  In these circumstances, we do not agree to the Order of Business.</P>

	<P>I am aware of that but, as with the previous speaker, I am making it clear that this is unacceptable because a calculation of the time &mdash; and this is a time proposition &mdash; suggests we have less than one hour to address the amendments on Report Stage when we have gone through the various steps that have to be taken to order the rest of the business.  It is not acceptable.  The proposition is to sit later than 8.30 p.m. and not later than 10 p.m. and that is restrictive.  The imposition of a guillotine and the limited time available <Col N="40"/>are not acceptable in terms of addressing important legislation and a raft of new amendments, which we have not had the opportunity to properly tease out.  We object to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a need to proceed with this level of business this week.  The issues arising tomorrow are important and have to be dealt with.  We can deal with the question regarding the EU-IMF deal tomorrow but it is a matter of providing certainty on the basis that there was some suggestion of there not being certainty.</P>
        <P>It is important to put the Bill through the House today.  There is other important business this week, which cannot be delayed, and while I understand and accept the difficulty that can cause, it is important that we get it through.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed.  As Deputy Gilmore said, we received 30 pages of Report Stage amendments to the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, which were circulated at 10.40 last night.  Members have not had an opportunity to consider them.  The amendments contain four major new policy initiatives about which we were not given notice, including a proposal for a sovereign annuity and sovereign bonds, the status of persons at work and the denial of employment rights to persons engaging in work placement programmes, the 4% levy on officeholders and major provisions in respect of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  No briefing was available on these important provisions today and it has proven impossible to obtain information from the relevant Departments.  This is no way to do business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is showing complete disregard to Members.  It is not possible for us to get a briefing in time to deal with these proposals adequately.  Will the Taoiseach show more regard for Members and for the major legislation he proposes to ram through today?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 38 agreed to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not agreed.  Deputy Ring, our spokesman on social welfare and protection, has brought to my notice the fact that the debate on the amendments mentioned by Deputy Shortall is expected to conclude by 9 p.m.  We have always objected to guillotines on Bills but this is a Bill that should be discussed.  There will be no objection to the reference to public office holders but a discussion might be necessary in respect of the definition of &ldquo;couple&rdquo; in the context of civil partnerships &mdash; there has been a degree of agreement on this &mdash; as well as work experience placements and the sovereign annuities and associated bonds from the National Treasury Management Agency.  With the debate to be concluded at 9 p.m. <Col N="42"/>too little time has been allocated to Report and Final Stages.  Accordingly, I object to the proposed guillotine in this case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Even as the Minister was publishing the Bill, the Government was announcing amendments to it.  Sections were introduced in the Bill as the process was moving forward.  It is unacceptable.  Debating 34 amendments within that short period of time will not afford the House the opportunity to deal properly with this legislation.  The Taoiseach was offering a modicum of assistance earlier but withdrew it.  Can he not reconsider the time being allocated, lift the guillotine and allow the measure to take its course?  We oppose the guillotine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>We oppose it for the reasons I have stated.  There are 34 amendments tabled and the likelihood is that we will get to debate a handful of them in the time allowed.  That is unacceptable given the scope of some of the new proposals which we only saw this morning.  There is no justification for the guillotine and the Labour Party opposes it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We must proceed in this way, difficult as it may be, because there is a range of work to be completed this week.</P>

	<P>With the Deputy&rsquo;s co-operation, we will outline a work programme for the next session of the D&aacute;il and take it from there.  We are returning a week early and the finance Bill will be produced thereafter in the normal way.  We will give that proper consideration and there will be other work to be conducted by the House as well.

	<P>There are three matters about which I wish to ask the Taoiseach.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, indicated this morning that statutory regulations pertaining to home care services were being prepared in her Department.  Is this being done through primary legislation or regulations, and when will it come before the House?</P>
        <P>The Green Party announced at a press conference that it would be withdrawing from the Government in January.  Have the Green Party Ministers informed him of the date on which they intend to resign from Government?</P>
        <P>I share a constituency with the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Mary Hanafin, and it always bothers me that she might know something I did not know.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="45"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When we discussed the issue of home care during Leaders&rsquo; Questions and questions to the Taoiseach, I made the point that the measures to be implemented in the new year will be the national guidelines and procedures for standardised implementation of the home care package scheme and the quality guidelines for home care support services for older people, which are due for publication, as well as guidelines for the home help service.  With regard to statutory regulation, it has been the norm that we produce such guidelines in consultation with the voluntary and community sector and the statutory services.  As there is a spectrum of care needs, we must ensure the response is proportionate and flexible.  It is important that we maintain the ethos behind many of the schemes, such as good neighbourliness.</P>
        <P>In the case of the home help scheme, people from within the community &mdash; in many cases, neighbours &mdash; are providing much-needed practical services and a home-care environment for people who require assistance.  In the vast majority of cases, the services provided are very good.  The priority up to now, as Deputies know, has been to deal with residential care services where that was required.  We must now consider the home care setting in a way that respects the ethos of the provision of home care while insisting on proper, professional and compassionate standards for people who are in receipt of care.  That is the balance that must be struck, and proportionality must be maintained.  In this way we can make sure the largest possible number of people have access to these services in a way that is consonant with good standards and neighbourliness.</P>
        <P>The other issue raised by the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The resignations of the Green Party Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  As I said, the Cabinet acts as a collective authority, and while there has been a statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Does it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it does.  A statement was made some time ago regarding the view of the Green Party Ministers that the dissolution of the D&aacute;il should be considered in the specified timeframe.  We are, as a collective authority, working through the issues to make sure our business is done and that all legislative measures consequent on the budget are enacted to provide the necessary certainty, while at the same time ensuring that other important work that is currently being pursued or that must be done within the timeframe specified is dealt with.  The work programme for the next session will give greater clarity in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Minister, Deputy Hanafin?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot throw any light on a query by the Deputy regarding the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I noted the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response on the finance Bill.  Can he tell us whether other legislation arising from last week&rsquo;s budget is also in the pipeline?  Are there one or more Bills yet to present?  When will the Taoiseach be in a position to advise on whether such legislation is in the process of preparation and when it will be published?  With regard to the Bills the Green Party is pressing to have included before a general election takes place &mdash; the climate change Bill and the corporate donations Bill &mdash; is it also the intent of the <Col N="46"/>Taoiseach and the main coalition partners to deal with both of those Bills in the upcoming term after Christmas and before the D&aacute;il is dissolved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the greyhound Bill while they are at it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to the budgetary measures that have been announced.  There is the finance Bill, some pensions legislation and also some betting legislation.  That can all be done during the course of the first session when we return.  There are also the banking issues.  There is important work to be done by the House in a reasonable timeframe and with proper and due consideration.  Other legislation that is at an advanced stage of preparation and approval by Cabinet will also be introduced in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of secondary legislation on foot of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments earlier on the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; report about elder abuse.  We have now heard reports of the abuse of elderly people in the community and in residential care, and we have seen the same thing with regard to children in residential care and in the community.  Before we begin to hear inquiries and reports about the treatment of people with intellectual disabilities, would it be possible to include this part of our health services in the inspection regime?  In this way we could ensure that those vulnerable people are protected.  We should not have another &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; expos&eacute; before action is taken.</P>
        <P>If the mental capacity Bill was enacted, it would ensure that a prosecution could be obtained for wilful neglect of a vulnerable person, whether someone with a disability or an elderly person, as we saw in the report last night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the mental capacity Bill is due for publication this session.  If this is a Bill that the Deputy feels should be included in our work programme in the new year, I can certainly arrange for that.  As he said, it is an important Bill and it would put the statutory framework on mental capacity on a modern footing.  Much good work has been done in the disability sector in recent years on a collaborative basis and it would be good if this could be further provided for.  This will be considered by the Whip based on what the Deputy has had to say about it and his constant interest in that area.</P>
        <P>The matter of intellectual disability and inspection regimes is one to be taken up in the first instance with the Minister for Health and Children.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point.  We should note that much excellent care has been provided in the absence of a statutory framework and that the provision of such a framework gives us no guarantee of uniform professional standards.  However, it would help to specify a clear duty of care.  We must acknowledge the professionalism of those who operate in different sectors, whatever the statutory or other regime they are working under.  We are all in agreement that every individual case of abuse is one too many.  A comprehensive review is being undertaken of the four cases that were highlighted in last night&rsquo;s programme.  That is as it should be.  It is an exercise in accountability and a proper response is required.</P>
        <P>The question of inspection regimes for carers of people with intellectual disabilities is something I will consider in consultation with the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened carefully to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply and to the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, this morning.  We still have not been told when the regulations will be published.  Will the Taoiseach give us a date?  He is right to say the vast majority of care is good but it is the exceptional cases that need regulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We have given this matter considerable airing today at various stages.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="47"/>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are the people who must be protected by regulation.  We need to know this is being dealt with urgently by Government.  Will the Taoiseach give us some indication of the date when those regulations will be published such that the small number of cases will be subject to regulation and, therefore, those people we saw on television last night will be protected?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Work is ongoing on this matter.  There has been a collaboration with the voluntary sector and consultation with the statutory sector to bring forward guidelines.  The first point of call is to issue these guidelines, to publish them early in the new year and to put in place a regime that will see their implementation.  They will be brought to the attention of everyone, including local managers.  The review being undertaken now is as a result of what has occurred and what has been highlighted.  There is in existence a complaints procedure where people, families and clients can have recourse to any complaint being dealt with.  Where people are dissatisfied for whatever reason &mdash; we often find a personality clash or something happens that breaks the bond of trust &mdash; it is necessary for good quality care to be provided.  Replacements can be provided and rosters can be changed.  Often they are changed to accommodate those individual difficulties that arise in families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is talking about the public sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the vast majority of cases we are discussing HSE-provided services.  A total of 55,000 home helps are run by the HSE.  Where home care packages have been adverted to there is also an involvement by the HSE in terms of procurement issues etc.  I contend that in the vast majority of these cases the level of complaint thus far is such that given the range of activities and the fact that &euro;200 million more is being spent in this area than was the case even a few years ago, even in the present circumstances, it is an indication of the need for the flexible response and the service in place.  There is a spectrum of need which varies from place to place and from individual to individual.</P>
        <P>In setting up or preparing for a statutory framework we must ensure this ethos is maintained.  This has been the means by which a quality care system has been provided thus far.  Keeping it close to the community, close to the family and people who live nearby and who know the individuals concerned is a significant advantage in ensuring that the system works.  Were there a different system with people leaving from places of employment to go out and do these tasks in another way we would not have as successful a scheme as we do.  I have no wish to be misrepresented in this regard.  We are all aware from our personal experience and we want to see the dignity of people maintained and that people are properly looked after.  One case is one case too many but the vast majority of cases are handled in a discreet, proper and professional way.  Where there are complaints, they too can be accommodated.  Let us not suggest this is a systemic problem, although I agree a review should be carried out to determine the extent of the lack of professionalism which was evident in the cases highlighted last night.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interest to do that.  That is being undertaken and local managers have been instructed and directed to do that.  It is a good practical response to last night&rsquo;s programme because certain people must go out and check that people are being looked after properly.  If some have started well but are now providing care in a way that is not acceptable, that has become complacent or routine or whatever the issues are, it must be identified at this point.  A complete review gives us the prospect of doing this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the indicative priority legislation programme for early in the new year will the Taoiseach give some indication as to whether it might be possible to <Col N="48"/>introduce the national vetting bureau Bill and, perhaps, the Central Bank (No. 2) Bill, both of which are considered to be urgently required given the present situation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about two matters of legislation.  No. 90 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper is the Twenty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2009.  This is a Bill designed at a time of economic emergency to facilitate the Government to apply the same level of public service remuneration reductions to members of the Judiciary as have been applied to other people.  It was published by Fine Gael in advance of the 2009 budget.  There have been two budgets in which public sector wage reductions have been applied, neither of which applied to members of the Judiciary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not going to debate this now on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Green Party has given the Government some extra time in January, would the Taoiseach agree to take this Bill on board so that when a general election takes place on this simple and straightforward issue, about which there would be no public controversy &mdash; we can hold a referendum to coincide with the general election?  This would ensure the Judiciary is not perceived as an elite apart from the public sector wage reductions that have occurred.  Will the Taoiseach take on board this Bill and allow its enactment?  Will he make Government time available for its enactment during the first week we come back and when the D&aacute;il sits again, if the finance Bill is not available to take at that point?</P>
        <P>Before the D&aacute;il closes this session, will the Government publish the new, apparently promised, wording, on which it is now working, for a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights in circumstances in which, apparently, the Government is not willing to take on board the proposals of the Joint Oireachtas Committee?  If we do not have the wording before the D&aacute;il ends this week, will we have it before we get to the end of this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot make any such commitment to Deputy Shatter in respect of holding referenda on the day of a general election, whenever that decision is taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not asking the Taoiseach to hold a children&rsquo;s referendum on election day.  I am asking about the judges referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.  I was about to come to that.  The Deputy should allow us even a proportion of the intelligence he has himself.  We can answer the Deputy&rsquo;s questions as we heard them; it is a matter of giving us some time to deal with them sequentially.  That is no problem.</P>

	<P>However, if the Deputy does not wish to hear the answers or he already knows the answers, what is the point?</P>
        <P>Work is continuing with regard to the children&rsquo;s referendum.  I cannot give a date this side of Christmas or the new year as to when that will be completed, when the Government will consider it or when we would have to come back to those involved in the previous work in this area.

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Pension schemes have been significantly impacted by the downturn in the financial markets.  Defined benefits pensions schemes are subject to the funding standard requirements as set out in the Pensions Act 1990, as amended.  In response to the crisis, this funding requirement was eased to allow schemes assess the impact of the crisis and determine an appropriate response.  In addition, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009 provided a range of legislative measures to further help the trustees-employers of pension schemes respond to the funding difficulties in pension schemes.</P>
        <P>Further measures have been announced in the national pensions framework which are being progressed by the national pensions framework implementation group.  In particular, I announced in October the development of the new model for defined benefits pension schemes proposed in the national pensions framework would be expedited by the framework implementation group.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The amendment to the Pensions Act which I am now bringing forward arises from proposals from the Irish Association of Pension Funds and the Society of Actuaries under which a new type of annuity policy, which will make reference to euro-nominated bonds, will be available for purchase by Irish pension schemes and investors.  In purchasing this new type of annuity and-or associated bonds, pension schemes will benefit from higher yields than are currently available from French and German markets thereby reducing the cost to pension schemes in meeting their pension liabilities and the requirement of the funding standard.</P>
        <P>In an Irish context, the National Treasury Management Agency will issue long-term bonds with a period appropriate to match the funding needs of a typical pension scheme.  These bonds will be available for purchase by the insurance industry who will issue annuities based on Irish yields or sovereign annuities.  These annuities can be bought by pension schemes to match their <Col N="55"/>pensioner liabilities.  It is proposed to make these bonds available from 1 January 2011.  These bonds can of course be purchased in the normal course by pension schemes.</P>
        <P>This amendment is part of a package of measures which are being introduced to assist defined benefit pension schemes and make them more secure in the future. Once these annuities and associated bonds are available, the funding standard amended to reflect engagement with this new annuity policy, the new defined benefit model and the deadline for funding proposals introduced early next year, it is not intended to revisit defined benefits pension schemes. Pension schemes must address their liabilities, their risk and investment strategies in order to ensure that they are properly funded.  In other words, we want to introduce a new type of bond that can be bought from the NTMA.  There is a double win here because the money that is used to buy these bonds or annuities will go towards funding the State.  On the other hand, they give a much better yield than German bonds.</P>
        <P>The skills development and internship programme is a new enterprise-led labour market activation initiative aimed at those who are at least three months unemployed.  Under this programme, participants will be offered a 12-month placement with host organisations in the private or community and voluntary sectors.  In addition to the actual placement, participants will undertake a significant education and training component, which will be certified and will aim to improve their skills and competencies.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S will have responsibility for managing the programme.  This will mean that participants will receive a F&Aacute;S training allowance equivalent to their social welfare entitlement and will also receive an upskilling bonus of &euro;100 per week during the actual placement phase of the programme.</P>
        <P>By providing 12-month placements coupled with a substantial education and training offering, it is intended that the programme will provide a structured pathway to employment for those who are unemployed.  The success of the programme will be entirely dependent on enterprises embracing the programme and offering quality placements to the unemployed.  The Government has made provision for up to 5,000 places to be supported under this programme.  However, this is subject to the level of interest and uptake by enterprises.  The Government, through F&Aacute;S, will facilitate these placements and provide the education and training provision to participants.  Details of the programme are currently being prepared and it is expected to be operational towards the end of the first quarter of 2011.</P>

	<P>Is that it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>This is no way to do business or to treat Opposition spokespeople.  We do not have the resources of the Government, nor the same backup facilities.  It is wrong that such amendments are introduced without our having had a prior briefing on them.  It is not the way to deal with legislation.  I am upset because one never knows what minefields may arise in legislation. </P>
        <P>I am disappointed by the way in which this Bill is being handled.  We have been talking about it since last since last summer, so there was no excuse for introducing it in the same week as the Social Welfare Bill which deals with budgetary changes.  It is wrong to deal with the legislation in this manner &mdash; two days before the House rises for the Christmas recess and then probably into a general election &mdash; because we will not have a further chance to discuss these amendments.  As we have seen before, legislation that is guillotined ends up in the High Court six months later where it is overturned.  We then have to come back to the House to deal with emergency legislation.</P>
        <P>The Minister is proposing 5,000 work experience placements but I hope these will be independently monitored.  We should put these people through their paces to retrain them.  At the <Col N="56"/>end of it, we want to see some of them being placed in jobs.  Something should be done for them in this respect.  Some form of independent monitoring evaluation is required and it would be wrong if that does not happen.  Last week, we saw what was going on in F&Aacute;S concerning qualifications.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad the Minister said that, along with the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, these people will also get &euro;100 per week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>

	<P>In order to participate in a programme, host organisations will have to pay &euro;150 per week per participant for a 12-month period into a fund managed by F&Aacute;S.  This contribution will be used to fund an upskilling bonus of &euro;100 per week per participant over and above their normal F&Aacute;S training allowance.  The sum of &euro;50 per week will be the host organisation&rsquo;s contribution to the upskilling costs of the participant.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unsatisfactory to provide this kind of information in this way.  It is unfair to me, Deputy Shortall and other speakers who must pick it up off the cuff.  It is unfair that we did not have this information before now.  It is unsatisfactory and I am unhappy with the way the legislation has been handled.  In dealing with every other Bill that has come before the House, we got briefings from officials.  In addition, we were able to do research and could thus put time and effort into responding to the Government&rsquo;s proposals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is not satisfactory.  I am disappointed because I do not like what is being put before us.  I hope this will never happen again and that no Government will use its mandate to push through legislation at the eleventh hour of a D&aacute;il session and the end of a Government&rsquo;s term in office.  It is wrong to do so.  We should be able to sit down with the Minister, as we did on Committee Stage, and discuss amendments.  We may or may not reach agreement on them, but at least we were able to discuss them.</P>
        <P>The Minister is talking about sovereign annuities and associated bonds, but I know nothing about them.  This legislation is being forced upon us and we are only now being told what is happening.  I will not pretend that I understand it, because I do not; even my researchers did not have time to work on it.  It is both unsatisfactory and unfair, and it is not good legislation.  It is not good for the House or the Oireachtas generally.</P>
        <P>A new section has been introduced concerning public office holders.  I am glad to see that where some people, such as judges, are not making voluntary contributions, they will be caught in relation to this.  Deputies and Ministers will also be making their contributions in this regard, and rightly so.  Last week, we saw major cuts for the blind, carers, the disabled and others on social welfare payments.  It is only right, therefore, that judges and every Member of the Oireachtas, including Ministers and Deputies, should also take their fair share of cuts.</P>
        <P>The civil partnership legislation, which covers a complex subject, has gone through the House.  We should have had more time to research the subject, however, to see what is being proposed in the legislation before us in that regard.  What effect will it have on cohabiting couples and same-sex relationships?</P>
        <P>It is wrong to bring this Bill before us at the eleventh hour.  It is not a good way to do business and neither does it make for good legislation.  I am disappointed to be back on Committee Stage and unable to discuss the Bill.  We have already discussed the earlier Stages of this Bill.  We <Col N="57"/>went on to discuss the measure that will oblige landlords whose tenants are in receipt of rent allowance to register from 1 January next.  That is a good measure.</P>
        <P>I am not supportive of people who come into the country and can be certified by telephone.  I cannot and will not support that.  We discussed the public service card at length in the select committee.  The Minister undertook to return to this matter on Report Stage and explain exactly what was being proposed by the Department.  We need this kind of security.</P>
        <P>I waited for the Minister&rsquo;s explanation of the &euro;20 million finger-printing machine that is lying idle.  Has the Minister or the Minister for Finance had discussions with staff to see when that very expensive piece of equipment will be up and running to stop fraudsters coming in and out of the country?  We should finger-print them when they come in and when they go out, so that we know if they are drawing social welfare benefits in every other European country.  Has the Minister discussed this matter with the Ministers for Finance or Justice and Law Reform or with the unions to resolve this serious problem?  It is a terrible thing to have an expensive piece of equipment and nothing being done with it.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that I did not know more about these amendments.  It is difficult to discuss amendments one was handed an hour ago.  This is not the way for legislators to do their business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Deputy Ring in registering my objection to the manner in which the Minister has decided to handle this legislation.  Last week, we saw rushed legislation following from the budget.  We expected to have an opportunity to debate this Bill, which has been considered in committee, and to take our time in dealing with it and give it adequate consideration.  It is not acceptable to circulate amendments at 10.40 p.m., which is when they were e-mailed to Members last night.  Most people did not see the amendments until this morning.  It was late morning before I had an opportunity to see them.  We were given almost 30 pages of amendments.  This is disrespectful of Members on this side of the House and of the House&rsquo;s role in legislation.  We cannot give consideration to amendments when they are tabled at such a late hour.  </P>
        <P>Besides, the Minister made a serious error in respect of the procedures to be followed.  Amendments seem to have been plucked out of the sky and no notice given to Members.  As they are substantial and deal with new matters we are obliged to go through this convoluted procedure in the House, which amounts to a recommittal.  An hour is being devoted to that, which must be taken from the short time allowed for Report and Remaining Stages of the Bill.  This is a bad way to deal with legislation.</P>
        <P>Rushed legislation is usually bad legislation because adequate time is not provided for scrutiny, consultation, taking legal advice, speaking with people who will be affected by the changes or &mdash; in this case &mdash; discussing the sovereign annuity proposals with the industry.  The Minister is not doing his job properly if this is how he deals with legislation.  One of his primary responsibilities is to legislate, as it is the primary responsibility of the House.  Dealing with legislation in this manner represents a dereliction of the Minister&rsquo;s duty to provide adequate time for due consideration of proposals.  For that reason, it is impossible to go along with what the Minister is proposing.  Members on this side of the House have not had adequate time to consider the proposals.</P>
        <P>Given that the Minister was not in a position to circulate the amendments until late last night, it is clear that he is not sufficiently briefed or <i>au fait  </i>with the significant proposals he is making.  For that reason, I have serious concerns about the potential for the implications of some of these proposals to be negative and flawed.  That is the likelihood, given the rushed manner in which the Minister has dealt with them.</P><Col N="58"/>
        <P>The civil partnership legislation has implications for the social welfare code.  Amendments Nos. 3 to 24, inclusive, deal with civil partnership.  These 22 amendments deal with legislation that came from another Department entirely.  When that legislation went through the Oireachtas, we were promised corresponding and pursuant legislation in the social welfare and tax areas.  I do not know why it was left to the last minute to circulate these detailed proposals.  I also wonder when we will see the taxation legislation.  Will those measures be ready in time for the finance Bill?  Why could the full package not have been drawn up at the same time with the other Departments?  Why were these amendments not included in the Social Welfare Bill proper last week so that they could be given adequate consideration on Committee Stage?  We must take these 22 amendments on trust.  I do not think anyone was in a position to look at them in any detail, read them, consider their implications or cross-reference or check them.  We are being asked to vote for these amendments blind.  We can only keep our fingers crossed and hope the Minister has some clue what he is doing.  This is no way to treat Members of the House or for Members to be forced into dealing with legislation.</P>
        <P>The proposal on sovereign annuities is potentially very good and something people working in the industry have been seeking.  There are two aspects to it.  One is the pricing of annuities.  Given the current expensive nature of Irish bonds and their high interest rate, the measure provides an opportunity to assist many of the pension funds that are in difficulty at present by switching the pricing mechanism from German bonds to Irish bonds.  That makes sense and has been requested for some time.  It could have been done sooner and would have conferred a benefit, but I welcome it nonetheless.  The other aspect of the proposal is that the NTMA will issue longer-term bonds in respect of retirement annuities.  I welcome that.  It makes sense.</P>
        <P>I must include a caveat.  I am not sufficiently <i>au fait</i>  with what the Minister is proposing.  Due to the rushed nature of the work he has done on the proposal, the Minister has not consulted with people in the industry who have been lobbying for this measure for some time.  It makes no sense that the people who made the proposal to him in the first place were not paid the courtesy of being asked to respond to the Minister&rsquo;s proposal.  Neither were they allowed to consider it and make further input.  The Minister should have availed of that expertise, given the dearth of pensions expertise that has been displayed in Departments for some time and the Government&rsquo;s ill-advised approach to pensions generally.  I hope we will have an opportunity to come back to this in the new year.  However, I fundamentally disagree with what the Minister is proposing to do in the pensions area, particularly in respect of tax relief.  What he is proposing will be extraordinarily damaging to the pensions industry and to the whole pensions area.  What the Minister is proposing will completely remove any incentive for people to save for their pensions.  Under his proposals, people would be much better off putting their money under the mattress rather than investing it in pension schemes.  The proposals to which I refer are ill-informed and will do serious damage.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider them.</P>
        <P>I am not sure that the Minister&rsquo;s proposal in respect of sovereign annuities is sufficiently tight to prevent any potential abuse.  In the short time available to me earlier this afternoon to consult people who are familiar with this area, a number of concerns were expressed regarding the potential for abuse.  For example, will any mechanism be put in place to stop people from investing in Greek bonds?  There is a view that the proposal in respect of this matter is not sufficiently robust and could potentially be open to abuse.  The proposal is substantial but, because it is being rushed through, there is a real danger that the Minister is going to get it wrong.</P>
        <P>The other matter under discussion relates to the status of persons engaged in work experience pursuant to certain placements.  Again, this is another area in respect of which there is major confusion.  The principle underlying existing work placement schemes is fine.  These <Col N="59"/>schemes have a great deal of potential and they provide opportunities for people who have good skills which they want to put to use or those who do not possess such skills but who want to acquire them.  The schemes also ensure, at a time of high unemployment, that people can gain work experience.</P>
        <P>As already stated, the position with regard to the existing schemes is fine.  However, I am of the opinion that it is not possible to put in place a scheme such as that outlined in the legislation on a hurried basis.  The Minister is operating on the hoof and the proposals relating to the new scheme appear to have been cobbled together in order that the Government could state, in the context of the budget, that it is taking action in respect of unemployment.</P>
        <P>In the specific amendment relating to this matter, the Minister is seeking to deny those who either are or will be on work placements the normal protections to which employees are entitled.  Those protections were hard won and were put in place through the enactment of labour laws.  I have serious concerns with regard to what is proposed.  Under the new scheme, some individuals will be working up to 40 hours per week for their dole payments.  These people will not receive anything extra on top of their weekly payment of &euro;188.  In addition, they will not enjoy the same protections as those alongside whom they will be working and who will be earning perhaps twice or three times the amount they will receive by means of their dole payments.</P>
        <P>The Minister is also denying the people to whom I refer any kind of common law protections.  What will be the position, for example, in cases of unfair dismissal?  If a person on a work placement is informed that the job they were doing is no longer available or that their performance is unsatisfactory, will he or she have any rights?  Will he or she enjoy any protection at all?  What will be the position with regard to data protection?  From what is proposed, it appears that those to whom I refer will be denied the basic common law or specific employment rights enjoyed by full-time workers.</P>
        <P>The existing work placement scheme has not been reviewed and little or no monitoring takes place in respect of it.  Whatever about the graduate placement arrangements &mdash; in many instances these work well &mdash; there are other arrangements in respect of which obvious abuse is taking place.  I browsed the relevant website recently and came across a case where a well-known shoe shop in the city was advertising for six assistants.  That is complete abuse.  It is inappropriate that those on work placement schemes would be obliged to work in shops of this nature as cheap labour.  The owners of the shop in question were seeking six people to work a full week on the understanding that it would cost them nothing because these individuals would be working for their dole.  I would have thought the Minister would be of the view that this represents an inappropriate use of a work placement scheme.  However, it managed to traverse the very low threshold which appears to apply in respect of what is deemed appropriate or inappropriate.</P>
        <P>The case to which I refer appears to involve an obvious abuse.  The Minister must review the scheme in order to ensure that employers will not use it as a means to procure cheap labour.  He must also ensure that displacement does not occur.  I recently became aware of a case involving a State agency which was on the point of recruiting a fully-qualified person to fill a job vacancy on full pay when the new work placement scheme was announced last year.  As a result, the agency in question postponed the appointment and later recruited two people from the scheme on work placements in order to fill the vacancy.  Again, this cost the agency nothing but the two individuals who were recruited were obliged to work for their dole payments.  It appears that they were abused in this instance.</P>
        <P>Another point to which I wish to refer is the allowance that is to be paid.  The Minister cannot expect people to take up work placements and be obliged to pay bus or train fares, buy <Col N="60"/>lunches and clothes for work and so on and then refuse to recognise the costs involved for these individuals.  It is interesting that IBEC recently made this very point and stated that its members wanted to pay participants on the work placement scheme an allowance but, under the terms of the scheme, were precluded from doing so.  What is happening makes no sense.  The Minister should recognise how much it costs for people to go to work.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance announced on budget day that there will be some 15,000 places available on the various schemes.  The Minister opposite referred to one of the schemes whereas the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill 2010 relates to all of them.  The difficulty we face is that the Minister has only informed us about one scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three different schemes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and there will be 5,000 places on each.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.  However, the legislation relates to the three schemes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It only relates to one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>According to that with which we have been presented, it relates to all three.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that participants in the skills development and internship programme in the private sector will be disqualified from receiving social welfare payments.  They will be paid, in a rather convoluted manner, via moneys channelled through F&Aacute;S.  The placements relating to this programme will last for between two and 12 months.  A person who partakes of this programme will have his or her social welfare payments discontinued when he or she takes up a placement, which might last for three months.  As a result of the way in which the Minister&rsquo;s Department is operating at present, when the placement ends the person will be obliged to wait until his or her social welfare payment is reinstated.  This does not appear to make any sense.</P>
        <P>This matter has not been well thought out and there are no&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;guidelines relating to the programme.  I searched the website of the Department of Education and Skills earlier today and the guidelines I found are totally confusing and appear only to relate to people who are working in schools.  What is proposed bears all the hallmarks of something that has been rushed and that was not thought through.  We will pay a price for the latter in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Finian McGrath.</P>
        <P>As the previous speakers stated, this is not the way in which to conduct D&aacute;il business.  What is being done is an absolute disgrace.  Some years ago, the Department of the Taoiseach produced a document entitled Regulating Better &mdash; A Government White Paper setting out six principles of Better Regulation.  Everyone of the principles set out in that document was <Col N="61"/>breached when the relevant amendments were brought forward at a late stage last night.  I object to the rushed nature of the debate on the motion before the House and also to the guillotine that will be imposed in respect of the Report Stage debate on the Bill.</P>
        <P>The context relating to the introduction of the Bill must be borne in mind.  The original legislation was rushed into the House and the debate on Committee Stage, for which, unfortunately, I was not able to be present, was also rushed and involved the introduction of major changes by the Minister.  This brings me back to the time in office of the former Minister, Michael McDowell, who used to do exactly the same thing.  He would produce a Bill and then, halfway through its passage, would produce a huge raft of amendments on Committee Stage and then would try to do the same on Report Stage.  This is not the way in which to do business and if one substantially changes a Bill from its original intention, my recommendation would have been to start all over again.  When tabling amendments, Opposition Members are continually told that if one attempts to change the focus of the Bill, one&rsquo;s amendment will be ruled out of order.  However, the Minister evidently can do as he pleases because proposals have been included in this Bill that have absolutely nothing to do with the original intentions of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill.  I simply make this point.</P>
        <P>In so far as possible, like other Members I wish to discuss some of the proposals that have been put before them in a limited fashion.  However, this is difficult when one does not have sufficient time to go into major details and when the briefing document from the Department merely comprises a number of paragraphs.  Although the consequences of the amendments with which Members will be dealing are the equivalent of another social welfare Bill, the explanatory memorandum is not huge.  As everyone is aware, in legislation it sometimes is difficult to reach the normal working language of people.  A note arrived yesterday evening to the effect that substantial amendments were forthcoming and which, as I noted, were outside of the original scope of the Bill.  Moreover, other Members and hopefully the Minister, will be aware that Oireachtas Members have been receiving thousands of e-mails rightly protesting against the sell-out of Ireland.  Buried among them, quite late last night, was an e-mail stating that these amendments had arrived.  Although I had received an indication previously that these amendments were due, these are the consequences of rushing it through.</P>
        <P>In the limited time available to me I do not have a major problem with the amendments pertaining to civil partnership.  I welcome them and as I stated during the debate on the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, I would have gone further in that regard.  If one considers the time that has elapsed since the Oireachtas passed the aforementioned Act and the preparation and so on, at this late stage I do not discern the reason these amendments have suddenly landed on Members&rsquo; doorsteps today, as they should have been included in the first Bill.  They would have been welcome and Members could have discussed them in a proper fashion, as they did on Second and Report Stages, even with limited time.</P>
        <P>The amendment regarding the 4% contribution to the social insurance fund from public office holders also is welcome.  I believe it falls far short of what is needed and that the proportion of the burden of recovery placed on Ministers, Deputies, judges etc. should be higher.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s pre-budget submission to the Minister for Finance made a number of suggestions on how to eliminate wasteful spending on exorbitant wages and it would have resulted in a greater degree of pain to those who are quite well-paid public servants and semi-State employees, as well as to those who charge exorbitant professional fees.  Those proposals are available.  Again, as I noted, I have not had sufficient time to examine the amendments with a fine tooth comb but I welcome the principle of these aspects of the amendments.  It is better late than never and constitutes movement in the right direction.</P><Col N="62"/>
        <P>I have a number of concerns in respect of the lack of any principal legislation governing internships and workplaces.  I refer in particular to the absence of legislation affording participants basic rights or legislative safeguards against worker displacement.  I believe the previous speaker also mentioned this issue.  Government amendment No. 25 pertains to the status of persons participating in work placement and internship programmes and provides for their disqualification from receiving benefits.  It is written in the usual convoluted fashion in which legislation is put together and I wish Ireland had the same plain English campaign as obtains in Britain because it would make it easier for Members to get to grips with it.  However, the gist of the amendment is that a F&Aacute;S training allowance will be paid to people.  It will be equivalent to their social welfare entitlement and on top of this, they also will receive an up-skilling bonus of &euro;100 per week.</P>
        <P>The key component in this regard is whether the enterprises and employers are available to offer work.  To date, a huge hunger on the part of the majority of those represented by IBEC to employ many more people has not been evident.  Their hunger to date has been simply to reduce the minimum wage and I am concerned that this job placement initiative will be used as cheap labour by some unscrupulous employers or will be used to displace existing workers.  This is a major concern that must be considered and whatever is done in this regard, there must be no possibility of existing workers being sidelined or removed from their position to facilitate an internship programme.  Moreover, there must be a mechanism in place for those who consider themselves to be aggrieved in this manner to gain access rapidly to the Labour Court or whatever institution before this becomes a practice among some within the business community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The language of the proposed section 298A of the principal Act contains warning flags that point to the vulnerability of those who take up such positions.  This section emphasises that participants, apart from the  Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, are deemed not to be employees of the person for whom they are working, because they are in an internship.  However, it also is at pains to state that the Minister is not deemed to be the employer either.  Who is the employer in respect of health and safety law in particular?  Is it F&Aacute;S or who has the obligations in this regard?</P>
        <P>As for the last major portion of the Bill, I welcome that for once, the huge volume of Irish private pension funds amounting to half a trillion euro, might be encouraged to invest in Ireland.  They should have been doing so from the outset and perhaps the Oireachtas should consider introducing a levy on those pensions to gain an immediate fund for the State.  For example, a levy of 1% would raise &euro;5 billion but one could also consider setting a compulsory percentage of such funds to be invested in Ireland to ensure that huge structural projects that must be carried out are built and delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill 2010.  I share my colleagues&rsquo; concern about the manner in which this debate has been handled thus far, regarding the notice given to Oireachtas Members, as well as the urgent need for an informed debate.  This is unacceptable and it is important to put on the record my major concerns about what is happening in respect of this debate.</P>
        <P>I wish to touch on three aspects of the Bill&rsquo;s contents.  These are the civil partnership and certain rights issue; work experience for certain people; and public office holders.</P>
        <P>On the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, one can see in its detail where it will also provide for changes to the social welfare code arising from the provisions of the Act.  The changes will relate to the definition of &ldquo;couple&rdquo; and will <Col N="63"/>also provide for the entitlement for registered or cohabiting civil partners to various benefits and allowances to mirror those already available to married or cohabiting opposite sex couples.  It is an important provision which we must recognise.  Many people in such situations have contacted Members of the Oireachtas about this issue.</P>
        <P>The changes to the social welfare code will affect all same sex cohabiting couples, not just those who opt to register a civil partnership.  This is necessary from an equality perspective as the social welfare code already recognises opposite sex cohabiting couples.  It is very important that this is recognised and I welcome the fact that during the debate on the Act we took a major step forward in the country to recognise these couples and new families in Irish society.  We can go another step further on the issue of equality.  There is broad consensus in the House on supporting these measures and protecting the rights of the people concerned.</P>
        <P>On persons involved in the work placement programme, one notes that the Bill deals with this and it is described as a skills development and internship programme approved by the Government in November.  The Bill provides for the purposes of any enactment or rule of law other than the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  Such participants shall be deemed not to be an employee and the Bill also provides that they are disqualified from receiving benefits when participating in certain employment programmes.</P>
        <P>This is something which sounds very good in theory.  I know from talking to many unemployed people, in particular over the past 12 months, that they are dying to get into some sort of work experience or placement.  Many people have come to my clinics who said they would work for nothing in order to get experience.  That is very positive and kills the myth that people on welfare will not work.  The vast majority of unemployed people on welfare are dying to get into work and become involved in placements.  However, I wish to sound a note of caution which has already been raised by a number of Deputies.  I am concerned about the protection of workers&rsquo; rights.  We have to be very vigilant in ensuring that some people do not exploit the situation, which is linked to the debate on cheap labour.  This is important.</P>
        <P>A number of speakers touched on the issue of pensions.  I ask everybody, in particular those involved in the investment of pensions, long-term bonds and pension funds, to invest in their own country.  I ask people over 60 years of age, many of whom have money on deposit, to go out and spend a few extra euro a week.  I understand in the region of &euro;95 billion is on deposit in banks in this country.  It is important to raise the issue in a debate on social welfare.</P>
        <P>We have heard a debate on regulation and how it failed dismally.  It always fascinates me that white collar criminals seem to get away with murder in scamming the system here, whereas people on welfare are hounded for every single euro.  It was an absolute disgrace to take money from the blind and the poor while other people got away scot free.  Unemployed people and those on welfare want to work.</P>
        <P>We should be thinking of creative ideas and not running away from the issue of tax.  The two Government parties are fudging the issue, in particular in regard to the budget.  They seem to think that if one imposes some forms of tax it will kill employment and development.  That is wrong; there is potential for an equitable tax system to develop the economy and bring it up to the same level of taxation as many other European countries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Many issues were raised.  The issue of sovereign bonds was something that was introduced in the budget and we want to proceed with it immediately.  That is why it is being discussed today.</P>
        <P>On internships, many people, including some Deputies present, approached me and asked why an employer could not pay people who were willing to work for social welfare a few bob.  It seemed like a simple idea.  When we examined the issue, we found a number of legal issues had to be addressed.  It is amazing that everybody wants everything done in a hurry but when one starts doing things in a hurry they ask one to do things slowly.</P>
        <P>The internship program will be monitored by F&Aacute;S.  People will be trained and F&Aacute;S will examine the abilities of the people concerned and make sure that the training is appropriate.  It is not a question of us offering cheap labour; it will not work like that and there will be a large training element to the programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On civil partnerships, the legislation is due to come into force in January and we need the provisions in order that we can commence the social welfare provisions in parallel with that.</P>
        <P>On public office holders, there would be an outcry if we did not put the PRSI provisions in place in parallel with all of the other impositions.  People would say we were feathering our own nests.  That is the reason that measure has to be passed.  There is a good reason for each measure.</P>
        <P>I would like to make a general point.  This is the third Bill this year from my Department.  There is an impression that there are limitless resources in Departments.  Legislation is very detailed and I can confirm that the officials in my Department have burned the midnight oil to prepare the Bill, as Deputies will know because they received the information late last night.  There have been months of work and they also have to prepare statutory instruments.  The officials have worked as fast as they can.</P>
        <P>We are introducing more Bills and making changes and the House in general has been putting pressure on us to bring in more reform and move forward faster.  To a certain extent, we are victims of our own success in that we can introduce many important changes, which are needed, by 1 January.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The amendment to the Pensions Act 1990 that I am introducing arises from proposals from the Irish Association of Pension Funds and the Society of Actuaries in Ireland, under which a new type of annuity policy, which will make reference to euro-nominated bonds, will be available for purchase by Irish pension schemes and investors.  In purchasing this new type of annuity and-or associated bonds, pension schemes will benefit from higher yields than are currently available from French and German markets, thereby reducing the cost to pension schemes in meeting their pension liabilities and the requirement of the funding standard.  In an Irish context, the National Treasury Management Agency will issue long-term bonds with a period appropriate to match the funding needs of a typical pension scheme.  These bonds will be available for purchase when the insurance industry issues annuities based on Irish yields.  These annuities can be bought by pension schemes to match their pensioner liabilities.  It is proposed to make these bonds available from 1 January 2011.  They can, of course, be purchased in the normal course by pension schemes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all pleased that we will have our own bonds.  Some pension companies in this country have a lot of money.  Some of them have invested pensioners&rsquo; money very badly.  There is a great deal of concern among punters whose money has been spent by such companies.  Many of them have lost a great deal of money.  We were told not many years ago that the safest investment one could make in this country was in bank shares.  The pension funds were very wrong in that regard.  I would like to ask the Minister a straight question about Irish agencies, particularly pension funds, that may want to buy these bonds.  I hope they will do so.  Are these bonds safe for Irish investors?  That is the question I want to ask.  Are they safe for those whose money will be invested in them?  We have had many bonds and many investment companies.  They are like economists.  One set of economists told us the boom would last until 2015 or 2016.  Another set of economists said we would have a soft landing.  As long as they are getting paid by the agency of the day, they will say what they are told to say.  They got it wrong in the past.  I want to know how safe Irish pensioners&rsquo; money will be when it is invested in these bonds.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As these bonds will be issued by the National Treasury Management Agency, they will be deemed to be sovereign debt.  The Government&rsquo;s clear policy is that it will honour all sovereign debt.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I have had a chance to read the Minister&rsquo;s brief, which has just been circulated.  I am a little surprised because I understood an opportunity would be provided for pension trustees to purchase Irish sovereign bonds.  The Minister&rsquo;s brief says trustees of pension schemes will be given an option to buy sovereign annuities issued by EU member states.  I am trying to figure out the implications of that.  Does this mean trustees could buy Greek bonds?  If another EU country was in serious economic difficulties and its bond yields shot up, could trustees switch their funds from Irish bonds to that country&rsquo;s bonds?  I am a little taken aback in that regard.  I did not think that was what the industry was looking for.  A few months ago, there was a certain nervousness about the question raised by Deputy Ring.  There was some concern about what would happen in the event of a possible default.  I would like the Minister to outline the provisions that have been made in the event of such bonds not being secure at <Col N="68"/>some future stage.  What kind of underwriting is the Government or the State prepared to do on behalf of such pension funds?</P>

	<P>When we discussed the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill 2010 on Committee Stage, I asked the Minister to give some reassurance to those who have money and resources in this country.  I have been told that over &euro;96 billion is being saved in this country.  People are right to be worried.  I asked the Minister to reassure them in relation to the post offices, in particular.  There was a great concern in that regard.  Many elderly people, in particular, were worried.  I am afraid that people will start to withdraw money and that, in turn, will lead to robberies and people getting beaten up.  I want the Minister to be strong and to assure the people that this scheme is solid and their money is safe.  When pension companies invest their money on their behalf, they should be assured that it is safe and backed by the State.  I want the Minister to be strong.  He should reassure the people that their money is safe, particularly in the post offices.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />believing that a reduction in the minimum wage will only create a disincentive to work, will have no impact on the public debt or on economic recovery and makes absolutely no sense at any level;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to table this motion on the floor of the D&aacute;il this evening in my name and that of my Labour Party colleagues, on the question of the national minimum wage.  I reaffirm the Labour Party&rsquo;s unequivocal and unambiguous long-standing commitment to the effect that we will not implement any reduction in the minimum wage.  It is low enough.  If legislation under which the Government proposes to cut the national minimum wage, section 13 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill is enacted, we will reverse this particular measure, which in the event will effect an 11.6% reduction in the minimum wage from &euro;8.65 to &euro;7.65 per hour, or in excess of &euro;2,000 per year.  That is a commitment we shall give if we are part of any future Government. </P>
        <P>In the event that the necessary commencement order is not in place, our commitment is then simple.  We will not bring forward a commencement order to allow the provision of section 13 to take effect.  I do not believe we can be any clearer in our commitment in this regard.  For those who doubt it, it is time they started to believe, in accordance with the words as set out in this motion.  The strength of the Labour Party&rsquo;s conviction in this regard may be gauged from the fact that notwithstanding that this matter was debated in D&aacute;il on Thursday and Friday last, we are back here tonight with a clear and comprehensive motion that deals with all aspects of this crucial issue.</P>
        <P>Cutting the minimum wage makes no sense at any level.  Indeed, it is under the guise of dismantling barriers to employment that the Government is claiming a cut in the minimum wage will ensure the viability of small to medium-size enterprises, SMEs, and will support job creation in those sectors where significant unemployment has occurred.  A closer look at the <Col N="70"/>actual sectors where the minimum wage is being paid might well show, however, that these sectors are in a process of significant contraction.  The Government&rsquo;s own reports for these areas, indeed, indicate the difficulties of creating jobs in these industries in future years and that the problem of survival in these sectors is one of over-supply in the markets they service.</P>
        <P>What is vital from our perspective is the fact that the national minimum wage is a floor, not a comfortable standard of living measure.  To put that in context it is equivalent to only 45% of average earnings in the private sector, or just more than half of the rate for manual, production, sales and clerical officers&rsquo; hourly earnings in the second quarter of 2010.  Let us ventilate the facts, articulate the reasons the Government is putting forward and let us rebut them, one by one, as I intend to do along with my party colleagues, Deputies Broughan, Kathleen Lynch and others who will contribute over the course of this debate.</P>
        <P>Cutting the minimum wage makes no sense at any level.  It undermines the social floor and it is proof positive that the least well off and most vulnerable are fair game as far as this Government is concerned.  The minimum wage is one of a number of false explanations in relation to the current economic crisis, intended to deflect attention from the banks and Government mismanagement.  The Government&rsquo;s claim that the Irish minimum wage is the highest in the EU is misleading, as I shall show in the course of my contribution.  It should be noted that in countries where there are lower minimum wages, workers have access to excellent free medical care and cheap public transport, which improves their standards of living.  It is likewise misleading to say that the budget leaves those on a minimum wage outside the tax net.  While they may not pay any income tax, they have very high taxes on goods and services and user charges, amounting to a regressive social charge, as was pointed out to the D&aacute;il last Wednesday, by my party leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore.  Taken together with the &euro;1 per hour rate cut the weekly wage will be reduced, in effect, by up to &euro;44 per week.</P>
        <P>More than 60% of workers on the minimum wage are women, and many will no longer find it worthwhile to enter the workforce, which is contrary to the policy of encouraging women to do so, as was specifically alluded to in the four-year plan.  Reducing the minimum wage will do little to improve competitiveness, as most workers affected are not in exporting industries.  Evidence from the USA shows that states with a minimum wage have lower unemployment than those which do not.  If there is no worthwhile minimum wage, there is no incentive for employers to train workers, or for employees to stay long enough to acquire skills.  The result is higher labour turnover and lower productivity.</P>
        <P>Reducing the minimum wage will lead to a large number of working poor, as in the USA where almost 20% of the labour force must have two or more jobs to survive, with negative effects on family life and social cohesion.  It is clear that a net effect of reducing the minimum wage will be a reduction in the incentive for people to take up low paid jobs and ultimately result in higher social welfare costs.  The most likely response of employers to a reduction in the minimum wage will be to cut the wages of their workers.  The assurances the Minister gave workers that employers will not cut their wages does not stack up.  Such assurances are either naive or cynical.  They are certainly not based on a realistic assessment of the likely actions of employers.  With a handful of honourable exceptions, employers will not be able to resist reducing existing wages, and the Minister has created more fear and uncertainty among workers.</P>
        <P>The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, has recovered literally millions from employers who defy the law and refuse to pay the minimum wage, and this cut will be a bonanza for them.  Other employers will be emboldened by the cut and will simply reduce the wages for their workforce by diktat to the lower rate, and with the threat of NERA effectively now removed the workers will be powerless to defend their wages.  More cynical employers will ask the workforce to agree to the cut, making them an offer they cannot refuse, for fear <Col N="71"/>of losing their jobs.  Some employers will do exactly that, and cook up excuses to justify dismissal of their existing workforce so that employees may be replaced by &ldquo;cheaper&rdquo; workers on a lower minimum wage.</P>
        <P>To ensure that workers were protected from these type of actions by unscrupulous employers, I tabled an amendment in the name of the Labour Party last Friday, that aimed to protect the existing situation of workers.  It indicated that the amendment of the national minimum wage to be effected by section 13 would not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the Act or under any contract of employment entered into before the coming into operation of the 2010 Act, and any legislation to which it applied.  It had the distinction of being widely agreed and argued for by Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Deputies, but it was still voted against.  As Deputy Shortall said, shame on every Deputy who knows that protection is needed but refused to support the Labour Party amendment.</P>
        <P>The legislation that will cut the minimum wage has another sting in its tail.  It allows the Minister to change the amount employers can deduct from wages in respect of board and lodging.  The current situation is that if an employee is given bed and board as part of his or her employment, the employer can deduct this from the minimum wage.  The deduction must be fair and reasonable, not just a sandwich at lunchtime, it must be stated in the employee&rsquo;s contract of employment and he or she must be given notice of the reduction.  The maximum that may be deducted is set out in S.I. 95 2000 and is currently: full board and lodgings &mdash; &euro;54.13 per week or &euro;7.73 per day; full board only &mdash; &euro;32.14 per week or &euro;4.60 per day; and lodgings only &mdash; &euro;21.85 per week or &euro;3.14 per day.</P>
        <P>The fear is that employers will further reduce this provision to further reduce workers&rsquo; wages.  The European Court of Justice has previously ruled that the cost of board and lodgings cannot reduce minimum wages.  The Minister should, therefore, in accordance with the ECJ ruling use his order to rule that board and lodgings cannot be charged against minimum wages.  In addition he should reduce significantly the amount that may be charged for board and lodgings.   After all, Government logic for reducing the minimum wage is that there has been a decrease in the cost of living.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The minimum wage cut is a massive transfer from the poorest paid workers to their employers. It could take as much as &euro;150 million out of the economy and more than &euro;2,000 per annum from workers&rsquo; pockets.  The figure of &euro;150 million is based on a &euro;2,000 per annum cut in the wages of 75,000 people in receipt of the minimum wage.  If only half their employers implement this cut, this figure will be &euro;75 million.  At a time when working families are struggling every day to make ends meet and to put food on the table they are being hit with three cuts, namely, a cut in the minimum wage, a cut in child benefit and a cut in social welfare benefit.  Cutting the minimum wage is counterproductive as it will destroy jobs and damage consumer spending. As I stated, the cut represents a possible reduction of as much as &euro;150 million, which is all the more pointless when we know it is the lower-wage earners who spend proportionately more in their local area and have a higher marginal propensity to spend.  Their marginal propensity to save is limited and currently stands at 1%.  This figure exploded during the previous two years and increased from the normal 4.5% to 12% or 13%.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has presented the minimum wage cut as some sort of &ldquo;job stimulus&rdquo;.  It is unfair and cruel to demand that low paid working people should subsidise their employment. This will not work as the impact of removing so much money from the local and real economy of shops and services will be the destruction of even more jobs.  The majority of employers will simply pocket the savings.  It is equally unlikely that employers will pass on the wage cut to customers.  Even if they did, it would be minimal.  For example, a wage cut of &euro;1 in the hospitality sector is equivalent to a reduction of 0.61 cent in the price of a meal costing &euro;60.00 or <Col N="72"/>more.  This cut is, therefore, unlikely to have any effect on demand.  Big businesses will benefit more from the cut to the minimum wage.  For example, an employer with ten employees will save &euro;400 per week as a result of the cut whereas an employer with 100 employees will save &euro;4,000 per week.  This will advantage large employers and increase their ability to undercut small local businesses, destroying more jobs.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party argues that the minimum wage cut does nothing to improve the public finances.  It reduces income to the State from the universal service charge and increases the level of payments from family income supplement.  The Government motion refers to the family income supplement, which is important for many people.  However, I never understood it to be in place to indirectly supplement employers, to which this is tantamount.  Cutting the minimum wage will take money from the public purse.  This type of thinking has already got us into trouble.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no justification for a unilateral across the board cut in the national minimum wage.The Minister&rsquo;s approach is based on a series of myths.  The Irish minimum wage is not the highest in Europe. The Minister has stated that it is ranked sixth highest but this disguises the reality.  In real terms, those earning the national minimum wage since the time of the last increase in July 2007 are worse off by almost 2.7% as compared to their position in July 2007. To suggest it is not the highest in Europe is to ignore the fact elucidated on numerous occasions by my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, that in 2007 prices in this economy had reached an all time high.  As well as making comparisons with other members states in terms of the minimum wage rate we must also, to validate this exercise and ensure it is accurate in all respects, make comparisons with the cost of living in those member states.  We will then have a true measure of the wage involved.  Bus fares here have increased by 22% since 2007.  The cost of electricity has risen by 2.2 %, local authority rents have risenby 21.5 %, the cost of breadis up by 12.5 % and milk is up by 19 %.  People on the minimum wage of &euro;8.65 are being asked to meet these costs despite their not having received an increase in payment since 2007.  This basket of basic necessities, which are important in the context of measuring CPI, have been significantly increased.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is already in place a mechanism under section 41 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 which allows employers who have difficulty meeting the minimum wage to apply for a reduction under a claim of &ldquo;inability to pay&rdquo;.  If the rate at which the minimum wage is paid is the problem it is being made out to be, it would be realistic to expect there would be a long queue of employers at the door of the Labour Court.  However,no employer has at this point made an application in respect of &ldquo;inability to pay&rdquo;.This is, in my opinion, a case of do not waste a good crisis.</P>
        <P>At &euro;8.65 the Irish minimum wage is not the highest in Europe.  As I stated, according to the Minister it ranks sixth.  Well informed others, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions rank it ninth.  There is already a lower starting rate of &euro;7.79 for adults,highlighting just how unnecessary is a unilateral across the board cut in minimum wage.  Existing rates are &euro;6.06 for under 18s,  &euro;6.92 for first year adults and &euro;7.79 for second year adults.   Therefore, rates significantly lower than &euro; 8.65 are already built into the minimum wage regime.  There is a sting in the tail: the new minimum wage rates will be as low as &euro;5.36 for under 18s and &euro;6.12 for first year adults. Arguably, this impacts disproportionately on women, young people and migrant workers.  25% of workers in the hospitality industry and 12% of workers in the retail sector are on the minimum wage.  These are sectors where women and migrant workers dominate.  When it comes to the first in line to be kicked by this Government, it is a case of women and children first.</P><Col N="73"/>
        <P>I question the legal underpinning for this approach.  This wage cutting exercise is contrary to the approved wage-setting mechanisms established by the International Labour Organisation, a sister organisation of the IMF, which has confirmed that it has not sought this reduction.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, went on the public record to confirm that a cut in the national minimum wage was insisted on by the EU Commission.  The National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 contains a provision requiring consultation with the Commission on low sectoral wage setting mechanisms.  How is this intervention by the Commission consistent with the objectives for social inclusion as set out in Article 3 of the Lisbon Treaty?  Pay policy is not an EU competence.  How then can the Commission be involved in these issues?  The Labour Party sees this cut in the minimum wage as mean spirited and counter productive.  All it does is inflict hardship on a significant number of people and households who rely on minimum wage employment.  As I stated earlier, it will act as a disincentive to work.</P>
        <P>People on the national minimum wage have not been immune to the fiscal adjustment.  In real terms, those earning the national minimum wage since the time of the last increase in July 2007 are worse off by 2.7%.  The income levy imposed a de facto cut of 2% and consumer prices, excluding mortgage interest, is 0.7% higher than in July 2007.  Relative to our trading partners, Ireland&rsquo;s national minimum wage is lower than in the UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and France.  This is important.  In terms of the purchasing power of the national minimum wage in competitor EU countries, Ireland ranks sixth.  Expressed in terms of the prevailing cost of living in each country, the purchasing power of the UK&rsquo;s minimum wage amounts to &euro;7.33 compared to &euro;6.78 for Ireland.  Notwithstanding a significant fall in consumer prices in Ireland last year, the cost of living remained 34% dearer than in the UK in 2009 due to a combination of a fall in UK consumer prices and a depreciation of sterling during 2009.</P>
        <P>During the course of 2010, this differential is likely to have narrowed due to UK inflation running at 3.2% in October and Irish inflation running at just 0.7%, along with a strengthening of sterling.  The UK rate is, in purchasing terms, expected to be higher than in Ireland due to a 2.2% increase in the UK national minimum wage rate in October 2010 to bring the rate to &pound;5.93, which is &euro;6.93 in nominal terms.  The impact of the national minimum wage on the cost of services in the Irish economy is grossly exaggerated.  Some 5.1% of those employed in private sector services in the Irish economy were earning the national minimum wage as of the second quarter of 2010 and while a larger number of workers were receiving sectoral wage levels, which are calculated as a premium over the statutory minimum wage, just one quarter of the total basket of goods and services is made up of services regulated by EROs and REAs.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party is strongly of the belief that we must reaffirm and confirm that a statutory minimum wage is the very minimum and it is a statement of a core value of our country.  It provides a threshold of decency under which society agrees workers&rsquo; wages should not fall.  A reduction would signal a race to the bottom, in which everyone, including low wage workers in the public and privates sectors, social welfare claimants and pensioners, will suffer.  We will not condone this cut and, at the first opportunity if this legislation is enacted, we will reverse it.  If it is not and a commencement order is required to ensure the reduction is introduced, we will not bring into operation the relevant and necessary order.  That is a clear and unambiguous commitment from the Labour Party and every Member should support working class people who work in the minimum wage environment, particularly women, who comprise 60% of those on the minimum wage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly commend my colleague, Deputy Willie Penrose, for using Private Members&rsquo; business this week to highlight the appalling decision by the Government to cut the national minimum wage from &euro;8.65 an hour to &euro;7.65 an hour under the Finan<Col N="74"/>cial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill.  The campaign to introduce a national minimum wage in Ireland was a long, difficult struggle led by the labour movement and by the Labour Party.  One of the key figures in the campaign for a minimum wage was Mr. Peter Cassells, who prioritised this important campaign during his tenure as ICTU&rsquo;s general secretary.</P>
        <P>I was honoured to be involved in the minimum wage campaign and I was delighted, as Labour&rsquo;s then spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment, to support the introduction of the national minimum wage of IR&pound;4.40 per hour under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 &mdash; more than 100 years after the first minimum wage was introduced in New Zealand in 1896.  I argued strongly at the time that the existence of a national minimum wage is a &ldquo;statement of core values, providing a threshold of decency under which society agrees that workers&rsquo; wages should not fall&rdquo; and this is reiterated in our motion.  However, it is also clear that since the introduction of the national minimum wage, it has operated in an effective way and has not been a disincentive to work.  However, the appalling proposal to reduce the minimum wage will clearly have the opposite effect.</P>
        <P>The experience in the US and the UK, for example, has proved that the introduction of a minimum wage is overwhelmingly positive in protecting the pay and conditions of the lowest paid, reducing the cost of social welfare payments and encouraging consumption.  It has also been found that the existence of a minimum wage does not have a negative effect on job protection or creation.  Landmark research in two US states by economists David Card and Alan Krueger in the 1990s found that an increase in the minimum wage did not lead to job losses.  In general, they concluded that the existence of minimum wage regulations have negligible negative effects.  This research has been supported by other Nobel Prize winning economists such as Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz.  In the UK, the impact of the minimum wage has been monitored since its introduction by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in 1999.  Various studies by the low pay commission and other bodies have found the minimum wage and increases in the hourly rate to have had a positive impact.</P>
        <P>However, even in the face of all of this evidence to the contrary, the Minister for Finance and his colleagues continue to insist that they are reducing the minimum wage to address our high unemployment rate and fall in competitiveness.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation said two weeks ago in the debate on the IMF/EU bailout: &ldquo;On labour costs, we will reduce the minimum wage by &euro;1 per hour...(based on ) research showing that a reduction in the minimum wage would result in an increase in employment in the medium term.&rdquo;  There is no such research and slashing the national minimum wage by a euro an hour and by &euro;40 per week will simply not achieve this objective.</P>
        <P>The Government and, especially, our delusional Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, have also tried to argue that cutting the minimum wage was forced on us by the ECB, IMF and EU as the cut in is included as part of the &ldquo;structural reforms&rdquo; to facilitate a so-called &ldquo;adjustment in the labour market&rdquo; in the EU/IMF programme of financial support for Ireland.  This is clearly untrue and the Minister was clearly lying&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot make the accusation that a Minister has lied.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>He was clearly misleading his colleagues, as was pointed out by Mr. David Begg in his analysis of an interview with Mr. Ajai Chopra of the IMF on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on 29 Nov 2010, which clearly showed the proposal to slash the minimum wage <Col N="75"/>came from the Ministers for Finance and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and all their colleagues.</P>
        <P>However, this shameful cut in the national minimum wage is being used as a trigger to produce an internal devaluation following the banking guarantee catastrophe of September 2008.  This means that the lowest income families and households will have incomes cut and social welfare benefits slashed.  The reduction in the minimum wage is, therefore, part of a wider ideological policy of this Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party are cutting the minimum wage and targeting the lowest paid workers in order that social welfare benefits, in turn, can be further slashed and burned.</P>
        <P>I welcome Fine Gael&rsquo;s support for the Labour Party&rsquo;s defence of the minimum wage, which we worked so hard to introduce, but the party also wants to achieve an internal devaluation by crushing the most vulnerable in our society and slashing social welfare rates. The identical proposal for &euro;3 billion in social welfare cuts by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and their &euro;6 billion austerity packages show that they continue to be the Jedward of Irish politics.  Fine Gael also wants to slash core public services with almost 50,000 redundancies planned.  However, while an internal devaluation is the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party-Fine Gael aim, as Deputy Penrose outlined, prices have not dropped to match the decrease in wages and conditions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In October 2010, it was reported that consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index, CPI, had increased by 0.7% in the year since October 2009.  The CPI for November 2010 was also 0.6% higher than in November 2009.  Deputies who do a weekly groceries shop &mdash; and I am one of them &mdash; will acknowledge that the cost of food remains relatively high, especially for families with children.  The Central Statistics Office also recorded in November 2010 that housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuel costs increased by 9.2% compared to November 2009.  There were decreases in clothing and footwear of 5.5% and of 3.3% in alcoholic beverages and tobacco but they are dwarfed by the increases in fuel and housing costs alone.  There were also increases in the prices of prescribed drugs and medication and house and motor car insurance and the ongoing costs of rents, petrol, hairdressers, GP fees, entertainment and leisure services remained high.  &ldquo;Rip-Off Ireland&rdquo; is clearly alive and well, yet our poorest working families will have &euro;40 per week less to cope with relentless rising prices.</P>
        <P>Crucially, the Government has made no effort to control or lower prices for basic goods or services which is what most of the income of low paid workers is spent on.  Why, for example, has it not tackled cartels in the liquid fuel, motor, medical and legal sectors that keep prices artificially high for these goods and services?  Why are we slashing the minimum wage while actions against these outrageously sheltered cartels are long-fingered?  One will not find them in the four year plan or next year&rsquo;s budget.  They will be dealt with down the line, but the Government is prepared to cut the income of our poorest people while leaving our richest people escape.</P>
        <P>It is grotesque, however, that the Government should use the device of an internal devaluation to allow Ireland to stay within the euro area by crucifying citizens living on the minimum wage and social welfare who are bearing the brunt of the so-called adjustment.  As my colleague, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, eloquently highlighted in this Chamber last week, who among us could survive on &euro;297 a week on the minimum wage?  How do we expect minimum wage workers to adequately feed and clothe their children when their already low wage has been cut by &euro;40 a week and they have to pay the new universal social charge, one of the most shameful actions of the Government?</P>
        <P>There has been no increase in the minimum wage since July 2008 and its real value over that period has been significantly reduced through the introduction of the 2009 income levy.  For most minimum wage workers, a simple trip to the cinema is an unattainable luxury.  One would <Col N="76"/>have little or no change out of &euro;50 after bringing a few children to the cinema and buying a few bags of sweets or an ice cream for them.  However, the Minister of State is prepared to stand over this hypocrisy and madness.  The Society of St. Vincent De Paul has reported a surge in calls for assistance since January with the number of calls up 35% across the country.  The number is higher in urban areas, including by more than 50% in Cork and more than 40% in Dublin.  The calls have been from low income and minimum wage earner families.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has continually highlighted &mdash; and does so again in this motion &mdash; that 116,000 workers or 6.6% of the total workforce already live below the poverty line and the working poor make up 24% of all of those in poverty.   Cutting the national minimum wage also targets workers who have perhaps the strongest work ethic in the country.  Minimum wage workers get paid a pittance for doing tough, grinding jobs, for example, cleaning, security and restaurant service that many in our society simply will not do. In the context of health care costs and the medical card, for example, these minimum wage workers would in many cases be better off not working and the Government is giving them such an incentive through its shameful performance on this measure.  As the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has stated, &ldquo;These are workers who pay for everything and qualify for nothing.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Many businesses and their representatives also agree that a reduction in the national minimum wage will not enhance competitiveness or create new jobs.  The chief executive officer of Retail Excellence Ireland, Mr. David Fitzsimons, sent a briefing note recently in which he stated that he supports the Labour Party position that a reduction in the national minimum wage is &ldquo;not necessary&rdquo;.  Some of the loudest calls for reductions in the minimum wage came from elements within the fast food industry.  Yet this is one of the sectors that is performing very well and making significant profits during the recession as people choose cheaper eating-out options.</P>
        <P>The savage cut in the minimum wage contrasts strongly with the ongoing refusal of the Government to reform outrageous and unjustified high pay in the banks, semi-State bodies and particularly in the private sector.  This week there was the fiasco of the proposed bonuses in AIB.  It is grotesque that senior management in an organisation can earn hundreds of times the salary of the lowest paid worker in the same organisation.  As Polly Toynbee noted long ago, the cancer of outrageous pay and bonuses comes directly from the private sector, and especially from the financial services sector.</P>
        <P>Our sister party, the Labour Party in the UK, has proposed the establishment of a new high pay commission to overhaul the dysfunctional compensation system.  There also clearly should be a maximum rate for public sector and semi-State salaries, perhaps set at &euro;150,000.  On a number of occasions in the past year I have called on the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to establish a high pay commission for Ireland to review compensation across the economy, not just in the public sector but also throughout the private sector.  Of course, a high pay commission that examines and regulates pay in the public and private sectors could be a mechanism for curbing excessive salaries that may discourage dynamic and effective people from leading public sector positions.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, the &euro;1 cut in the national minimum  wage is appalling and shameful, and must and will be reversed.  It is designed to make the poorest workers in the country bear the brunt of the Government&rsquo;s crazy banking policy through an internal devaluation mechanism, which the Labour Party opposed from the start in September 2008.  However, the Government has taken little or no cognisance of its implications for the poorest and lowest income people in this country.  I commend Deputy Penrose once more on bringing forward this motion.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="77"/>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Penrose on introducing this motion.  Most of us were shocked and amazed at the details of the budget.  When the Minister for Finance made his Budget Statement there was no detail in it, but when the details emerged we were shocked.  I am not sure why we were.  After all, we have had 13 years of Fianna F&aacute;il rule and we know at this stage that members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party are masters at protecting their friends.</P>
        <P>The budget ultimately resulted in the Government removing just under &euro;5 billion from the economy, not the &euro;6 billion it had announced.  I do not believe one can include the sale of State assets, because it is a once-off event that will never happen again.  It will not have that option next year.  When it comes to adjusting our finances there is nobody like Fianna F&aacute;il for exposing the type of class ridden society we have.  If others were drawing up this budget, they would have started at the top.  They would have provided that those working at the top in semi-State companies who are earning sums in excess of &euro;200,000, &euro;300,000 and &euro;400,000 per year would have their salaries halved.  That did not happen.  Anybody else would have ensured all the consultants who are employees in the State sector would have their wages reduced.  That also did not happen.  It is as if the woman who cleans the hospital is a lesser being than the consultant.  She is not.  She is as important and pivotal to the health of the patients as the consultant.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not recognise that because, ultimately, the only people that party has any kinship with are those with great wealth.</P>
        <P>One wonders who put together this budget.  Clearly, the people who did so are so far removed from the everyday lives of ordinary people that they do not realise its consequences.  I met three women yesterday afternoon when I was walking through town.  One was a widow, one was a lone parent and the third was on the minimum wage.  I believe that when the first two left, they walked away feeling sorry for the woman on the minimum wage because she was going to lose &euro;41 per week of her income.  Nevertheless, the widow has been impacted twice while the lone parent has been also impacted.  These were three average women out walking during the afternoon, two of them seeking work, and this Government had done that to them.</P>
        <P>They had one message, &ldquo;Get rid of this awful Government.  It does not realise what the rest of us have to put up with.&rdquo;  Christmas is approaching and people on the minimum wage will be left with less than &euro;300 per week on which to live.  That money is needed to put food on the table and to buy toys for their children.  Believe it or not, the poor still celebrate Christmas, although this year they will have less with which to celebrate it.  Instead of starting at the top, this Government started at the bottom again, as it has always done.</P>
        <P>The last two speakers are correct that good employers are not seeking this reduction in the minimum wage.  Thankfully, there are some very good employers.  They know a happy workforce means a more productive company.  What worries me desperately about this move is that it is not about the minimum wage, but is directed at social welfare.  It is about driving down social welfare and ensuring the gap between what one gets paid for work and what one gets from the State will be even greater.  People who are on social welfare through no fault of their own, who have worked for the past ten years and have never been unemployed previously and who now find themselves at the mercy of this awful Government must sit up and take notice.</P>
        <P>People on the minimum wage will not be able to afford the increased costs in health, education and their utilities.  They will not be able to afford to put food on the table for Christmas.  When the general election is held in January or February I hope the reaction will be like that of a woman to whom I spoke recently.  When a Fianna F&aacute;il canvassers came to her door last weekend she said, &ldquo;Not only have you blighted my life, you have darkened my door.  Get out of my house.&rdquo;  That is exactly what Fianna F&aacute;il will be told on the day of the general election, and it cannot come too soon.  People on the minimum wage will not forget this.  It is the most dramatic drop in income that any group in this country has absorbed.</P><Col N="78"/>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and his colleagues will defend it through the amendment to the motion.  Until now I believed that the Minister for Social Protection had some compassion for people who are dependent on the State.  I now believe he does not.  No Minister with that portfolio should have allowed this to happen.  When the Minister is having his dinner on Christmas Day, he should think of the people to whom he has done this, the people whose lives he has destroyed.  They will be waiting for him, but not in the long grass.  This time, they will be in full view, standing at their doors waiting for him.  They will tell him not to darken their doors and to get out of the driveways, as one canvasser was told last week.</P>
        <P>The Minister knows this cut is awful and should not happen.  He must reverse it.</P>

	<P>The National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 is a strategy for economic recovery with the aim of restoring stability to the public finances, improving Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness and stimulating enterprise growth and job creation.  Reducing the budget deficit is necessary but it will not, by itself, solve the economic difficulties.  Continued export growth will protect and expand high-value employment and stimulate domestically traded sectors of the economy.</P>
        <P>Ireland has regained competitiveness over the past two years as wages have adjusted and costs have fallen, helping to price ourselves back into global markets.  The frontloading of structural reforms to increase competitiveness and to improve labour market flexibility is central to the strategy outlined in the national recovery plan.  Building on the progress already achieved by this Government, it includes extensive measures to underpin our ability to compete in international markets by reducing the costs facing business, but also by increasing competition in sheltered sectors of the economy and supporting sectoral enterprise policies.</P>
        <P>I am glad to say that there is now clear evidence that wage and other costs are adjusting throughout the economy, and are expected to continue improving relative to trading partners.  The fall in the live register in each of the last three months is a welcome sign that these changes are beginning to bear fruit.  The latest research shows that a reduction in the national minimum wage will reduce the cost of doing business and support an increase in employment in the medium term.</P>
        <P>It is clear that there are significant labour market bottlenecks that we have to tackle.  These include the access to opportunities for up-skilling and re-skilling, especially in the case of those who were employed up until recently in sectors that have been most affected by the impact of the recession; the challenge &mdash; in the face of tight fiscal conditions &mdash; of targeting cost-effective <Col N="80"/>activation programmes to those most at risk of losing contact with the labour market and of drifting into long term unemployment; and developing a more effective and streamlined response to the needs of the unemployed and removing disincentives to participation on training, education and employment opportunities.</P>
        <P>In order to target better our activation measures, the national employment action plan,or NEAP, supports activation measures for job seekers and provides for a systematic engagement of the employment services with unemployed people.  It has been in operation since 1998 and is currently being re-invigorated to ensure deeper engagement with those at risk of long-term unemployment.  The Minister for Social Protection has set out his plans for the rationalisation of the NEAP towards greater capacity  and efficiency.  These measures will include more frequent and intense intervention with priority clients; the development of a profiling and case management system in 2011; sanctions in the case of unemployed persons on the live register unreasonably refusing to co-operate with the plan and-or with appropriate training, education and employment interventions; and changes to provision for one parent families to alter the passive nature of income maintenance that currently prevails.</P>
        <P>In 2009, job search support measures were put in place to double the capacity to cater for the rise in referrals from the national employment action plan, increasing the annual referral capacity to 154,000 persons in 2010, which is almost double the referral capacity that existed in 2008.  Despite the difficult fiscal situation, the number of training and employment programmes for the unemployed has increased significantly from 66,000 in 2008 to over 160,000 in 2010.</P>
        <P>The labour market activation fund aims to assist in the creation of training and education provision for the specific priority groups among the unemployed.  A total of 60 organisations have been successful in securing funding.  These organisations encompass the private, not-for-profit and public sectors and are providing approximately 12,000 training places for priority groups of the unemployed at a cost of &euro;32 million.</P>
        <P>In addition to the training and employment provision for the unemployed, the Government has indicated in the national recovery plan and in the 2011 budget that it will be introducing several new measures to strengthen the framework of labour market activation supports for the unemployed.  These will include a skills development and internship programme with provision for up to 5,000 places; an expansion of the number of placements available on the work placement programme from the current figure of 2,000 to 5,000 in 2011; and a new community work placement scheme, which will provide up to 5,000 additional places in the community and voluntary sector.</P>
        <P>An estimated 166,000 learners, including the unemployed, will benefit from full-time and part-time further education opportunities.  Almost 1,800 unemployed people were supported to embark on part-time undergraduate and postgraduate programmes from September 2009 in areas that support the goals of the Smart Economy.  Over 70% of these were between six and 12 months on the live register and 55% indicated that their motivation for undertaking the programme was to enhance their career prospects.</P>
        <P>The labour activation measures I have outlined are being complemented by measures to generate employment opportunities, including the extension of the employer job PRSI incentive scheme to the end of 2011 and by the transformation of the business expansion scheme into a new employment and investment incentive.  The family income supplement scheme provides income support to families with children that have employees on low earnings.  The payment effectively preserves the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employees might only be marginally better off than if he or she was claiming other social welfare payments.</P><Col N="81"/>
        <P>The FIS applies equally to one and two-parent families.  The payment amount is based on a fixed proportion of the gap between the assessable income &mdash; net of income taxes and social contributions &mdash; of the household and prescribed FIS income thresholds.  Currently this fixed proportion is 60% of the difference between the weekly income and the income threshold for the family size.  As these thresholds are linked with the number of dependent children in a household, FIS provides an important policy instrument in reducing child poverty in working households, as well as improving incentives to work.  FIS was paid to 25,963 families last year, in respect of 55,724 children.</P>
        <P>By implementing these measures over the past two years, we have radically transformed the nature of our skills-based economy.  All is not lost and many of the people who previously worked in our boom economy are now getting the opportunity to re-skill, retrain and to re-educate themselves.  This is happening in line with a situation where the economy is expected to grow in the future.  It is no accident that we have responded swiftly to this challenge, doubling the number of places in a very short timeframe.  The minimum wage reduction has to be seen in the context of making ourselves more lean, more competitive and more ready to adopt the export led growth that will grow with greater intensity once we climb out of our current situation.  I thank Members opposite for their patience.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The national recovery plan presents a detailed strategy to drive economic recovery, restore stability to the public finances, improve our international cost competitiveness and provide the necessary support to our enterprise sector.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that the business environment continues to be supportive of enterprises, large and small, promotes export growth and encourages growth in all areas of the economy.  The Government&rsquo;s four year plan has a particular focus on structural reform.  The measures to tackle high input costs for businesses, action to remove barriers to employment, and the enhanced activation measures are all critical to improve our competitiveness and underpin economic growth and job creation over the next four years.</P>
        <P>Our plan seeks to support the private sector by removing potential structural impediments to competitiveness and employment creation, and by pursuing appropriate sectoral policies to encourage export growth and a recovery of domestic demand.  Labour costs represent a relatively high proportion of the total input costs across a range of locally trading sectors.  They are a significant input into the cost of domestic services, and they also affect our ability to sell abroad.  In addition, they are a significant influence on foreign direct investment decisions.  Let me be clear, labour market reform is a prerequisite for Ireland&rsquo;s long-term economic recovery.  Unless steps are taken now to address labour market inflexibility, it is likely to inhibit employment growth in Ireland and lead to a loss of competitiveness in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The national recovery plan outlines how Ireland&rsquo;s national minimum wage has increased six times since its introduction; it is now 55% higher than its original level.  It is forecast that by the end of 2010 the consumer price index will have increased by approximately 28% since 2001.  The hourly rate of the national minimum wage is the third highest in the EU, after Luxembourg and France, and, at its current rate, is 30% above the average national minimum wage level in the EU 15.</P>
        <P>Minimum wage levels vary widely within the EU, from &euro;123 per month in Bulgaria to over &euro;1,683 per month in Luxembourg.  The countries with relatively high minimum wages are Luxembourg, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United Kingdom, in all of which the minimum wage has been close to or above &euro;1,000 per month.  Another five member states &mdash; Portugal, Slovenia, Malta, Greece and Spain &mdash; comprise a second group with intermediate minimum wages, from nearly &euro;550 to &euro;900 per month.  A third grouping of nine coun<Col N="82"/>tries with the lowest minimum wages &mdash; between about &euro;100 and &euro;400 per month &mdash; consists of Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Estonia, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland.</P>
        <P>When assessing compensation across the economy on an hourly basis, the Central Bank found that per-hour economy-wide compensation levels were 12.8% higher in Ireland than the euro area average in 2008.  It is interesting to note that the OECD has emphasised the importance of wage flexibility as a means of boosting demand for Irish workers and preventing unemployment from persisting at high levels.  According to the latest figures from the CSO for the second quarter of this year, the minimum wage rate now applies to about 3.2% of the workforce and has a disproportionate effect on employers in the hospitality, retail, manufacturing and horticultural sectors, which are suffering from extremely difficult trading conditions.  Labour costs are a high percentage of operating costs in these sectors.</P>
        <P>The latest advice available states that the minimum wage sets a baseline for wage negotiations.  It is assumed that wages up to 1.5 times the minimum wage are affected by changes in the rate, and up to 30% of wage rates may be affected by a change in the national minimum wage.  In addition, it is estimated that anywhere between 170,000 and 300,000 workers are covered by either employment regulation orders or registered employment agreements which set out minimum wage rates on an hourly or weekly basis for specific categories of employees.  Our four year plan commits to reviewing these.</P>
        <P>I will state clearly that financial benefit to the Exchequer is not the rationale for the proposed reduction in the minimum wage.  The four year plan states that, given the scale of the unemployment problem, any legislative and policy obstacles to job creation must be removed.  It is essential to strike the right balance among the minimum wage, labour legislation, social welfare rates, taxation and activation of the labour market to avoid disincentives to returning to work.  The programme of activation measures being implemented by the Government, as mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Conor Lenihan, will keep workers close to the labour market so they are ready to take up the jobs that will arise as the economy recovers.</P>
        <P>Recent research published by Forf&aacute;s, and advice following from it, clearly stated that a reduction in the national minimum wage would result in an increase in employment in the medium term.  The challenge we all face is to work to restore economic growth, maximise employment and prioritise the needs of the most vulnerable so that the progress we have made in tackling poverty in recent years can continue.</P>
        <P>I wonder where Deputy Shortall will get her savings.  She spoke about not accepting reductions in the minimum wage and in social welfare benefits.  It is becoming increasingly obvious that the Labour Party and Fine Gael are becoming the alternative collision rather than the alternative coalition.</P>

Fine Gael wants to cut public sector numbers by 30,000, which is twice the Labour Party target.  If the parties opposite cannot agree on these fundamentals, their ability to form consensus and <Col N="83"/>take tough decisions in government is at best questionable and at worst laughable.  Despite the many criticisms from the Opposition, the Government is taking the difficult decisions and the necessary action to return Ireland to economic growth.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the contributions in the House, although many economic theories are being turned upside down.  The Labour Party&rsquo;s proposal, if taken to its logical conclusion, suggests that in times of crisis we should increase wages unilaterally across the broader economy.  That would certainly dig us out of a hole.  Any economic study would suggest that in times of high unemployment and problems with competitiveness, wage restructuring across the broader economy is essential.  This is particularly the case in view of the fact that wage restructuring is taking place across the eurozone and, more importantly, across the globe in general.  It is important that we consider this in a broader context, making sure there is competitiveness in the economy, that we can sustain the current wage rates and that we can trade our way out of our present difficulties.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the minimum wage is to protect people on low wages and ensure they have a proper and decent standard of living.  It was introduced in 2000 by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  Successive Fianna F&aacute;il Governments have increased its level to &euro;8.65 and, more importantly, established a strong corpus of legislation to protect workers&rsquo; rights.  It is disingenuous for people to come to the House and point out that this Government is unilaterally throwing away all the gains made by workers in recent times.  It is simply not a credible argument.  We must have an honest debate in the House about the difficulties that are being experienced.  It is true that no Government likes to reduce the minimum wage, but we must be honest with people, particularly those who are on social welfare and would love an opportunity to work but, because the economy cannot sustain a minimum wage rate of &euro;8.65, cannot obtain employment.  A reduction is essential to provide a stimulus in that area.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, referred the areas of wages, taxation, social welfare and labour activations measures which must be taken as an overall package.  Let us consider the areas which are struggling and under great pressure, including the hospitality, retail and the horticultural sectors.  It is not a credible argument for people to suggest they can sustain the present rates.  Shops, supermarkets, retail outlets, restaurants and bars are closing throughout the country as we speak.  Were we to take on board the Labour Party policy, then we would increase the minimum wage even further above &euro;8.65.  In his opening remarks, Deputy Penrose stated that those on the minimum wage spend proportionately more in the local economy and that they contribute more to central services in the immediate economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>If that is the case then an increase should further help local economies.  Unfortunately, economics does not work that way.  We live in a real world, something that will dawn on people who are flirting with and considering the policies of the an alternative Government across the House.  It is like playing leapfrog with a unicorn in that it may sound like a good idea in the beginning but it gets progressively painful as one continues.</P>
        <P>Let us consider what the Government has done in recent times.  I refer to the four year plan to ensure funding is available to the State during the next four years.  This deal involves the <Col N="84"/>IMF, the EU and other organisations and states throughout the European Union.  This is an indication that there is no short-term, quick-fix solution to the issues we face.  We are in a difficult situation.  The country is on a precipice. We must bring forward policies that are difficult, which may be painful and will cause a certain amount of distress to people.  We accept as much on this side of the House.  However, at least we are honest enough to point out that this is necessary.  This applies not only to the reduction of the minimum wage but throughout the public sector, the readjustment of pension contributions, the embargo in place, the seeking of further efficiencies from the public sector and in the private sector as well.</P>
        <P>People are faced with harsh realities on a daily basis.  Employers with up to nine employees may have to look one of them in the eye and explain that they cannot be kept on.  Employment rights are in place to deal with employers who abuse their workers and seek to undermine workers&rsquo; rights.  A body exists and is available to inspect, enforce and prosecute people who infringe on workers&rsquo; rights.  Equally, many employers throughout the country are keen to retain as much employment as possible.  That is not possible at present in the economic cycle.  Certain people have consistently highlighted that this is an attack on the poor and those on low pay.  It is not an attack on low pay.  This is about attempting to ensure that more employment is generated for people with low skills or people in part-time work.</P>
        <P>Deputy Penrose referred to the reduction in the minimum wage and people using the minimum wage and the family income supplement as a subsidy for employers.  The same argument could be made in the case of a person who is employed for two days per week and who draws social welfare for three days per week.  That is the same argument.  Is that a subsidy to employers? No, it is simply that the employer cannot afford to pay such a person for two days per week or only needs that person for two days per week.  We must be honest.  Those in positions of leadership, regardless of which side of the House, should be able to stand up and clearly state that this is done out of necessity because of the need to ensure we are competitive and can generate more employment at the lower end of the economy.  This is the purpose of it.</P>
        <P>Those of us on this side of the House have been proud in recent years to consistently increase the minimum wage as part of the social partnership agreements.  The agreements set out clearly, in statute under the National Minimum Wage Act, how we arrive at increases in rates of pay.  One could argue that further rates of pay in the economy may not be sustainable in the longer term.  We must be honest about this as well.  For example in construction, people are not being paid according to registered employment agreements and are moving to C2 forms.  People are now working as self-employed persons and undercutting the rates of pay because, one could argue, the rates of pay in the current climate are not sustainable.  There is a haemorrhage of jobs throughout the construction sector.  To suggest we are attempting to undermine all protections in this House does not represent a fair debate.</P>
        <P>Regarding the four year plan, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, outlined the commitment to review the registered employment agreements, REAs, and the employment regulation orders, EROs, which is essential.  Even before the advent of the IMF this was something we discussed in the House on Committee Stage and Second Stage debates on employment rights.  There is a need to streamline these agreements and bring cohesion to these areas and to collective bargaining.  This is a matter on which we must bite the bullet.  We must ensure the system is in place which responds to market needs.</P>
        <P>Market need is not about putting profit in employers&rsquo; pockets.  It relates to the demands of the market and what it can sustain at a given time.  At present, we cannot sustain the existing arrangements across the board as suggested by certain people opposite because it is popular and it provides a good soundbite.  Some of the wages in our economy are unsustainable at present.  We are competing against other eurozone members and the UK.  Some have suggested <Col N="85"/>we should follow the UK but we must be more competitive than the UK.  If we are not more competitive than the UK our people will be working in the UK.  This is something about which we must get real.  We have no wish to force people abroad but if we try to sustain the current rates of pay in some areas that is where people will end up.  We cannot sustain the existing numbers in employment without a lower rate of pay.</P>
        <P>This debate is an opportunity to outline that an employment rates body exists, that is, the National Employment Rights Authority, a body much criticised and maligned from time to time.  When I was Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, I took part in several debates in which people urged me to reduce the number of inspections and to ensure certain industries would not be inspected because they were under pressure, which speaks volumes.  The National Employment Rights Authority exists for a definite purpose.  It ensures workers&rsquo; rights are protected and that rates are agreed in a competitive situation, either through the legislation in place to deal with the minimum wage, or through the enforcement of EROs or REAs.</P>
        <P>We must accept there is a need for an urgent discussion in this Chamber and elsewhere on the setting of wage rates throughout the economy.  There is merit in the motion but it indicates a certain amount of populism propagated in certain quarters.  It has been suggested this is an attack on the poor and on people on social welfare.  It is nothing of the sort.  The Government is making difficult decisions to at least ensure that competitiveness is sustained in the economy.  For example, students have not been able to access work in recent times as everyone is aware because many of the businesses employing people on the minimum wage cannot survive.</P>
        <P>Only when an order is signed will the minimum wage be reduced.  Employers should be conscious that they would be in breach of employment legislation if they unilaterally reduced the minimum wage without discussion or consultation with their employees, a fact which must be highlighted.  While the minimum wage is &euro;8.65 per hour, employers must pay &euro;8.65.  People should not be shy about reporting instances of abuse to the National Employment Rights Authority.</P>
        <P>No Government is keen to come to this House and reduce the minimum wage.  However, it has been done for the reasons I have outlined and for the reasons outlined by my colleagues on this side of the House.  We must be honest.  This process is to ensure that people can find work at the lower rate of pay in very difficult times in this economy and for their families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Clune, Damien English, Paul Connaughton and Richard Bruton.</P>
        <P>I support the motion and I commend Deputy Penrose for bringing it forward.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, spoke of making decisions with regard to competitiveness.  Government&rsquo;s role is to strike a balance and find a fair solution.  Competitiveness for the small employer can be dealt with in two ways.  First, there is the crude measure of cutting the minimum wage.  The other is to eliminate the employers&rsquo; PRSI contribution of 8.5% on employees&rsquo; earnings which would save &euro;30 a week per employee on the minimum wage for each employer while the Government would save &euro;40 per employee a week.  Both measures benefit the employer; the first penalises the employee.</P>
        <P>How can the Minister of State expect someone to live on &euro;297.62 a week?  Under the old minimum wage rate of &euro;8.65 an hour, an employee on a 40-hour week would earn &euro;346 a week, &euro;17,992 a year.  On top of that, he or she would pay an income levy of &euro;359.84 a year.  The new rate will see a reduction in weekly pay of &euro;41.46, or &euro;2,080 a year, with the gross wage coming to &euro;306 per week, &euro;15,912 a year.  In addition, a minimum wage earner will pay &euro;435.76 on the <Col N="86"/>universal service charge and an extra 21%, &euro;75.92, in tax.  Not only has the minimum wage been reduced, the amount of tax minimum wage earners pay has increased.</P>
        <P>There is a contradiction in the Minister of State&rsquo;s claim that those on the minimum wage will not remain on that wage level.  Many of them are women in temporary employment in cleaning and the hotel trade.  They will not come off the new minimum wage quickly.</P>
        <P>We all agree employers have difficulties with rising costs.  I had that experience over many years as a self-employed accountant.  A measure, however, must be found that does not penalise the less well-off.  A single person on the minimum wage will more than likely not qualify for either a medical card, rent supplement, because they work more than 30 hours a week, or fuel allowance.  Under the old rate, the margin between jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and the minimum wage averaged at &euro;143 a week.  Under the Government&rsquo;s new rate, the difference will be &euro;110 a week.  The Government should be putting in place measures which will encourage people to go into employment.  Instead, it has come up with a proposal that if a jobseeker gets a job that pays the minimum wage, he or she will actually lose many social welfare supports which may not be to his or her benefit with little difference in income rates.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State pointed to minimum wage rates in other countries.  However, Ireland has its own standards.  Would the Minister of State be able to live on &euro;297 a week?  It would be a good effort if all Members, once a year, tried to live on the minimum wage for one week.  If that happened, I am sure the Minister of State would not be introducing this proposal.</P>
        <P>The Minister asked where the Opposition parties would find budgetary savings.  The reduction in the minimum wage actually makes no savings for the Exchequer.  All it does is further penalise the less well-off and create a greater social wedge.  Yet, the Government had no problem putting &euro;40 billion into the two failed entities of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  We also need to know when the Minister for Finance first learned about the &euro;40 million AIB bonus package.  His road to Damascus conversion yesterday to get the AIB board off the hook does not ring true.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House.  I hope the Government will see some rationale and common sense on this matter and reverse its decision on the minimum wage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>Considering there was not much time last week to discuss the reduction in the minimum wage rate, I am glad to have a further opportunity to focus on this measure.  It makes no sense for the Government to reduce the minimum wage by &euro;1 per hour as it does not save the Government any money for balancing the budget.  Decisions in this area should always be taken to encourage people into work and off welfare, as they will always be better off in employment.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael proposed in its budget submission that the minimum wage should not be cut but the 8.5% employer&rsquo;s PRSI contribution should be abolished, a more cost effective measure for employers.  Such a measure would be more imaginative than taxing the 4% of workers on the minimum wage.  Those budget cuts last week that focused on the lower paid will only take money out of the economy, leaving less discretionary income to be spent on activities such as going to the cinema or going out for a bite to eat.  Instead of providing an economic stimulus, the Government has provided a disincentive for people to spend money.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael also proposed the reduction of the VAT rate from 13.5% to 12% to encourage more consumer spending or for people to make home improvements such as house extensions.  These kinds of imaginative and creative measures will get the economy going again and keep people in work.  The Government, however, has done the opposite.</P><Col N="87"/>
        <P>I was disappointed there was no focus on the joint labour committee&rsquo;s employment regulation orders.  This is an area that needs urgent assessment rather than a nodding commitment to tackling it some time like that given to dealing with nursing home regulations.  We have heard all the arguments against these orders but they actually make it expensive to employ people and run a business in sectors including agriculture, hotels, retail groceries, security, tailoring, shirt-making and contract cleaning.   The JLCs and employment regulation orders are making it difficult to operate businesses and employ people, not the level of the minimum wage.  The focus has been on the wrong area.  It should have been on the JLC and employment regulation orders in an effort to get business costs down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this important motion and thank Labour Party colleagues for tabling it.  The key message is that it is a statement of core values.  What a legacy the Government will leave behind.  First of all it breaks the country and then it leaves people in dire straits.  Families are panicking and wondering how they will pay their weekly food bills.  On top of all that, as a final stroke, the Government hits the minimum wage.  It had done well on that previously, with our support because we all bought into this statement of core values.  The minimum wage is about fairness and setting a mark in order to make it worthwhile to work.  If the minimum wage is cut by another euro per hour, however, it will not be worth working.  People also face the cost of getting to work, even though the Government has failed in many areas of public transport.  Deputy Penrose and I represent rural areas where many people cannot just hop on a bus to work.  Even where buses are available there are no free travel passes, so it costs money to get to work.  The Government should make it worthwhile to work and thus, wages must cover costs as well as providing a decent amount of money to live on.  That will not happen if the minimum wage is cut further, however.  The cost of living in Ireland is not as cheap as in other countries.</P>
        <P>Groups that attended Oireachtas committees to seek a reduction in the minimum wage never proved their case.  We asked them to tell us honestly whether this was about trying to drive other wages down, because the minimum wage is often used as a benchmark, but they never came back to us with any answers.  Last week, Ministers quoted documents which showed that if the minimum wage was increased by a certain amount there would be a corresponding loss of jobs.  There is no conclusive proof that jobs will be lost by leaving the minimum wage as it is, however.  If there were, we would have a proper discussion about it, but there is no proof.  It is not good enough to make such incorrect statements.</P>
        <P>What is the real history of this matter and who made the decision to reduce the minimum wage?  Fianna F&aacute;il TDs will be campaigning in the next couple of months saying that Europe or the IMF did this.  They will say: &ldquo;Sure, those boys in Europe are awful.  We&rsquo;d no choice&rdquo;.  They will blame everybody else but that is not true.  When we met Commissioner Ollie Rehn one of the first things he mentioned was the minimum wage.  I found that very strange and wondered what relevance it had to our meeting with him.  He said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to address the minimum wage and will have to look at that&rdquo;.  I asked him why he was singling out the minimum wage and he said it was not his call but something that we would have to look at.  He said it had been discussed within the Government&rsquo;s plans.  He said it was not his idea but it had obviously been put into his head by the Minister for Finance and other Ministers.  It was the Government&rsquo;s idea to do this because it failed to tackle the cost of business across the board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>It failed miserably.  I thought the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, would make a change on this.  He said he would tackle it.  On many occasions during Question Time, we discussed red tape, insurance costs, banking charges, telecommunications and PRSI, <Col N="88"/>all of which are heaped onto businesses.  All of these costs were discussed with promises to cut them by 25%, but it never happened.  The four year plan contains more wishy-washy statements about tackling competitiveness, while all the Government is doing is driving down the minimum wage.  Fine Gael presented an alternative option &mdash; if the Government really wanted to reduce business costs while protecting employees, it should be done by reducing PRSI.  It is the same difference because it reduces the cost to business of employing staff.  Seemingly, that is what the Government wanted to do, but I do not believe it.</P>
        <P>In other budgetary measures, the Government proved that it comprises a mean bunch of people.  Who else would go after a blind person or hit carers, another group the Government failed to address during the good times?  The same logic flows from the minimum wage cut, which is a mean attempt to take money from people at the lowest end of the jobs market.  They do not have much money, yet they are working in some of the toughest jobs: behind a bar or in a restaurant, working weekends, as well as split shifts and double shifts, just to make a living.  Nonetheless, they get whacked by this Government at the last minute.  It is very wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has made a serious mistake in reducing the minimum wage.  I compliment Deputy Penrose on his speech.  He is correct in saying that this does not make any political or economic sense.  It is wrong to attack people on low incomes.  I am afraid that the Minister will push more people onto social welfare because it will be better for them than to work.  We cannot have a situation where it will not pay those on very low incomes and in receipt of rent allowance to work.  Work should pay in this country.  What is the thinking within the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department?  Approximately, 465,000 people are unemployed.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>

	<P>I am just trying to be helpful to the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>That is grand but I will be helpful to the Minister of State also.  The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, said earlier that this seems to be very good news for the Government because the figures are down.  He forgot to mention the number of graduates and others who have emigrated.  In my own county and town, I have noted the number of young people who will not be home for Christmas.  This is the first time in recent years that we have seen young people having to leave the country because there is no work for them.  More young people will be graduating in June, yet there will be no work for them either.  I hope there will be places for them to go to because there will be no work in this country.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister of State to answer this question &mdash; with that number of people on the live register, why did more than 5,000 people receive work permits to enter this country last year?  Was that done to push down the minimum wage?  Even if the Minister of State&rsquo;s unemployment figures are correct, why do we need to bring in people to do work which can be done by Irish workers?  The Department should examine this matter.</P>
        <P>Deputy English is right to refer to stealth taxes, which have been discussed by Opposition Members as well as Fianna F&aacute;il TDs.  The Government has lost control of local authority regulation.  There has been no respect for business for the past 20 years because the Government thought builders and bankers would keep the country running, but that was never going <Col N="89"/>to happen.  We forgot where we started in small businesses, which constitute the backbone of the economy.  Nevertheless, small businesses have been attacked by the Government through over-regulation and attacked by local authorities through stealth taxes.  Every time local authorities wanted an increase in water charges, rates or other levies, they thought they could impose it on the business community and they did so.  I am surprised that over the years the national chambers of commerce did not take a case against the Government and local authorities because that section of the community was paying rates yet getting nothing for them.</P>
        <P>Small businesses pay rates, water and refuse collection charges.  A new regulation now seeks to control where publicans put their empty bottles.  There are to be more levies and regulations over where bottles are to be disposed of.  Publicans are hardly able to keep the pub doors open, not to mention pay their staff and taxes, yet somebody comes along with a new regulation stipulating that empty bottles must be disposed of in bags and buried for Deputy John Gormley and the Green Party.  The sooner we get rid of this Government, the better because it has destroyed business and the country generally.  The sooner the Government leaves office, the better because this green energy campaign is costing jobs and money in rural Ireland.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister confirm that people who pay the universal social charge, which is paid into the social insurance fund, will qualify for a contributory old age pension?  This charge is to be levied on judges and politicians and it is going directly into the social insurance fund.  Will they be able to draw out of the fund?  Payments to the social insurance fund have always entitled those who make the payments to a contributory old age pension.  Will this entitlement apply to those who pay the universal social charge?</P>
        <P>What interest rate will be charged on the bonds it is proposed to offer?  There is a massive amount of money in savings accounts.  Could these bonds not be offered to people who have savings?  We will be paying the IMF and the EU 5.8% interest on money borrowed.  Why not ask Irish people to buy bonds?  People who have money in savings accounts might be prepared to invest if they got a fair return for their investment.  If we are prepared to pay 5.8% to the Germans, the British or others, why not give 6% to Irish people and let them assist the country and make a profit at the same time, rather than have brokers in Germany or Britain making a profit.</P>

        <P>Sovereign bonds are issued by the Government and are perfectly safe.  The Government has been at pains to state that there is no circumstance under which we will renege on sovereign debt.

        <P>Pension funds do not have to buy into this.  Deputy Shortall asked if pension funds could buy Greek bonds.

Pension funds can buy European bonds and they have been buying German and French bonds.  They can buy non-Irish bonds.</P>

        <P>It seems to be to be a no-brainer that people should be encouraged to buy Irish bonds.  The money stays in the country, there is a better return and pension funds become more solvent.  Adjustments will be made to the funding standards to reflect this.  It is a very important step in the right direction and will give us a good return.</P>

	<P>The Minister says there will be no gain from paying the universal social charge.  The social insurance fund is used to pay carers, pensioners and people with a disability.

	<P>I will put it another way.  What would have been said if we had awarded ourselves a 4% payment?  For example, civil servants employed before 1995 make a contribution and get a very marginal gain.  They get a <i>pro rata</i> State pension and that depends on whether one has ordinary contributions.  If we had said we were to get an A rate pension in return for a payment of 4% it would be said we had done it for our own gain, that we always look after ourselves very well and why should someone get a Deputy&rsquo;s pension and a State pension.</P>

	<P>It mainly applies to people who hold public office.

However, the Department has not distinguished itself in the context of adopting modern technologies.  In the past, it proved to be incapable of even collecting the PPS numbers of landlords.  At that stage, we were informed that the relevant form was set out in a certain way which could not be changed and that the computer system could not cope with it as a result.</P>
        <P>In several reports relating to fraud and overpayments within the Department, the Comptroller and Auditor General made the point that one of the main reasons for the latter is that while the Department has a great deal of information at its disposal in respect of the circumstances of different claimants and their families, the relevant systems cannot communicate with each other.  The Department has the information but it does not necessarily possess the technology that will allow it to use this properly.  In light of the Department&rsquo;s poor performance in respect of such technology, I would be sceptical with regard to the proposal to allow people to sign on or whatever by way of mobile telephone.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to a system which could recognise people&rsquo;s voices and identify whether they were in the country.  The theory behind that is fine but I find it difficult to believe that the Department would be in a position to operate such a system.  I do not have a closed mind about this matter.  If it can be done and if the system is secure, then well and good.  However, I am concerned that in light of the pressure on budgets, the Minister is trying to save money in the context of staff resources and that, in doing so, the Department would ease up in respect of putting the proper controls in place.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 6 proposes that the new system should be put on trial on a limited basis for a specified period and that its effectiveness should then be assessed and evaluated.  The <Col N="93"/>amendment also proposes that the new system should be introduced on a pilot basis and that, following a period of two years, the performance of the Department&rsquo;s controls relating to the tackling of fraud and overpayments would be reviewed.  I suggest that the Department should try out the new technology but that it should tread carefully in doing so.</P>

	<P>The Department&rsquo;s IT systems are continually being upgraded.  What happens is that what is now the newest system will be the oldest system in five years time.  At that point, what is now the oldest system will have become the newest again in light of the constant circle of upgrades that obtains.  The Department has very good IT systems.  People tend to underestimate the scale of what the Department does each week, particularly in the context of the delivery of payments to 1.5 million recipients of social welfare.  In addition, it is continually gathering information as a result of people seeking their entitlements through the system.  In light of the actual limitations of IT systems and the fact that technology has a limited shelf life, I am of the view that the Department has a good record.</P>
        <P>Let us ignore the issue of mobile telephones for a moment and concentrate on Deputy Ring&rsquo;s amendment.  What the Deputy is opposing is the Department being given power under the law to put in place electronic signing pads in its social welfare offices.  Such pads can verify people&rsquo;s signatures, thereby obviating the necessity for them to present at a counter in order to sign on in front of an official.  If a person&rsquo;s signature is not recognised by the pad, he or she will then be obliged to present to an official.  However, the system will work for those who sign on their own behalf.  Deputy Ring is stating that he does not want this to happen even on a trial basis.  I am surprised by that.</P>

	<P>Deputy Ring and I live in the west.  In the area in which I reside, people are more advanced than that.  The Deputy is not opposing the specific technology proposed in the Bill, he is opposing the use of any electronic technology for signing on, regardless of how simple it is to operate.  I am of the view that he is wrong in opposing this measure but I accept that he has a right to do so.  However, what the Deputy is actually opposing is the installation of electronic signing pads in social welfare offices and I want him to be aware of that fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>On the night before my party&rsquo;s Ard-Fheis last year, I attended a wedding in Portugal.  I carried out one transaction with my credit card in a restaurant.  One month later, I discovered that an amount of either &euro;2,500 or &euro;4,500 &mdash; I cannot remember which &mdash; had been debited from my account.  As already stated, the wedding was held in Portugal but the transaction to which I refer was carried out in the Netherlands.  That is why I do not trust electronic systems.  The bank was obliged to pay out the money in question because I was not at fault for the fraudulent transaction and had done everything above board.  We are all aware of the scams that have been perpetrated in this country in respect of credit cards.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shortall is correct, if the Minister wants to operate the new technology on a trial basis then he should by all means do so.  However, the pilot project should be quite small in <Col N="94"/>order that we can assess how the system works.  I am opposed to the use of this type of technology at present and the Minister has not convinced to alter my views.  The Minister stated that the Department has a good record.  However, he recently informed a meeting of the relevant committee about the amount of money the Department had overpaid as a result of errors made either by computers or staff.  I am concerned about the use of this technology and I will not be supporting its introduction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Ring.  The presumption that computers will be able to read and verify people&rsquo;s signatures is not a fair one.  There are those who have no difficulty copying the other people&rsquo;s signatures and who have been very effective in doing so.  I will not refer to specific instances in that regard but I am aware of a number of them.  I can state without any shadow of a doubt that the system the Minister is proposing is not foolproof.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>If the people to whom the Deputy refers are that good, would it not be possible for them to forge signatures just as well in front officials?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  There has been a great deal of discussion in respect of fraud and there is a presumption that massive fraud is taking place.  All of the cases with which I have dealt in recent times involve instances where people&rsquo;s payments were cut off.  These individuals did not receive their payments for a considerable period thereafter.  The position with regard to deliberate fraud is different.  I accept that a minority of people are probably involved in such fraud.</P>
        <P>The presumption that all new technology is good and that we should automatically put it in place does not stand up to scrutiny.  Let us recall what happened with regard to the electronic voting machines.  There were those of us who were opposed to the introduction of such machines because we were aware of what they could be used to do.  It was proven beyond doubt that the technology to be used for electronic voting was not reliable.  The PPARS system used by the HSE was also not reliable and did not do the job for which it was intended.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shortall is correct.  If new technology is to be introduced, this should be done on a very small scale and in such a way that it will not give rise to enormous costs.  In addition, contracts which would commit us to massive investment during the next ten years in respect of technology that might not work at all should not be entered into.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputies that is not what is intended.  All of the systems the Department uses are electronic.  Consequently, it is necessary to have the legal ability to use electronic signing and one cannot even try anything without it.  It always amuses me when people speak of their lack of trust in electronics.  I often ask them whether they are willing to sit in a modern aeroplane because half the time they are landed by electronics.  One element that has made modern flight so safe is the use of technology.  It is not that the pilots are so much better but that the aeroplanes are so much better.</P>

	<P>A lot fewer.  As the Deputy is aware, it is one of the safest forms of travel because human error has been removed.  It is the reason that it is relatively safer to get into an aeroplane than into a car because there is less human input involved.  Therefore, while <Col N="95"/>I do not believe that electronics cannot be tampered with or that they are foolproof, in many cases they provide a better result.  In industries throughout the world, it is evident that electronics provide a more consistent result than does human intervention.  This measure should at least be tried and I need this section to do so.  However, if the Opposition is opposed, it must be put to a vote.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, line 35, after &ldquo;number&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and a tax clearance certificate&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These two amendments and the following couple all relate to the payment of rent supplement.  Rent supplement probably is the area of social welfare that is crying out most for reform.  The manner in which it operates at present poses the greatest poverty trap to people in receipt of social welfare.  There has been much loose talk recently about the welfare system, people being incentivised to remain in receipt of welfare and how it does not pay them to take up work.  However, this is not the case as the vast majority of people would be better off moving from welfare to work.  Approximately 7% of jobseekers are in receipt of rent supplement and for people in such circumstances, it is not worth their while to take up a job.  This is because of the manner in which rent supplement is withdrawn if someone goes to work.  Consequently, if the Minister was serious about removing the disincentives and encouraging people from welfare to work, this issue should have had his immediate intention.  It certainly appears as though he probably will not have a chance to do anything about that now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>One never knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; but this must be the number one priority for the incoming Government.</P>

        <P>A number of steps could be taken to remove this poverty trap.  It works against both the recipient and the State and the more such traps that mean people will remain in receipt of social welfare are in place, the more it costs the State to provide such welfare support.  Moreover, the individual recipient obviously is caught in a trap and while the vast majority of such people would like to be in a position to go to work, it simply is not worth their while financially to so do.  In addition, there is much leakage in respect of tax compliance.  A total of &euro;420 million in rent supplement is being paid to private landlords at present but there is no system in place to ensure that those landlords who are recipients of rent supplement are tax compliant.  This has been very loose down through the years and although the Committee of Public Accounts recently has drawn attention to this issue a number of times, we still are a considerable distance from this.  The Minister now is talking about collecting PPS numbers but it is known that this has not been successful in the past.  In addition, it is known that there is a time lag whereby approximately 18 months elapse before any kind of follow up or checking is carried out on the PPS numbers that have been provided.  This system simply does not work.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party proposes that rent supplement would not be paid to any landlord unless that landlord could produce a tax clearance certificate.  As I noted on Committee Stage, this is <Col N="96"/>a basic requirement.  If anyone is doing any kind of work for a council, Department or State agency, he or she is required to produce a tax clearance certificate.  As Deputies, Members are obliged to provide such a certificate after election.  Similarly, in respect of grants that are paid to small builders to carry out bathroom conversions and similar work, they always are required to produce a tax clearance certificate.  It makes eminent sense that landlords, who are in receipt of such vast amounts of public money, should be required to produce a tax clearance certificate because it is known that the level of tax avoidance among landlords is considerable .  As Minister for Social Protection, the Minister is responsible for the transfer of such large amounts of money from the public purse into the pockets of private landlords that he really should be absolutely vigilant about ensuring that those people are tax compliant and that the State gets back what is due to it in respect of taxes.</P>
        <P>The other amendment under discussion proposes that not only would landlords be required to have a tax clearance certificate but that the payment of rent supplement would be made directly to landlords and there are many reasons this would be a good idea.  First, bodies such as Threshold and others that work in the area have been seeking this change for several years.  There are significant savings to be made, were the State to negotiate directly with landlords, including switching to a retained deposits system.  At present, approximately &euro;7 million is lost to the Exchequer every year through expenditure on deposits.  This could be saved on an annual basis, were the Minister to move towards a direct payments scheme and a deposit retention scheme.  In addition, this measure would work better from the tenants&rsquo; perspective because at present, difficulties exist in this regard.  In some cases, irresponsible tenants do not pass on the rent or the deposit.  Similarly, some irresponsible landlords fail to return the deposit and some landlords insist that tenants make a top-up payment.  Many highly vulnerable tenants are caught in a situation in which they are fairly powerless.  Their options are limited as they are at the lower end of the scale, very often in substandard accommodation, and often are caught by unscrupulous landlords.</P>
        <P>For all kinds of reasons, it makes absolute sense to have radical reform of the rent supplement system.  It should have been done long ago and money is being lost to the State by the failure to do it.  Most important, however, not only are tax receipts lost to the State but tenants would be much better off were this rent paid directly to the landlord and were they to go on a differential rent, thereby removing the existing poverty trap.  It is regrettable that the Minister has not done this but if the Labour Party is in government after the next election, this will be its number one priority when dealing with the disincentives that exist within the welfare system.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated on Committee Stage, I believe there must be rolling reform of the rent supplement scheme and I have been involved in this since I came into this Department.  I do not have a particular objection to the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal in respect of the tax clearance certificate and it should be considered in the ongoing review.  However, it does not actually deal with the problem because if one has a tax clearance certificate before one takes on a tenant, it does not prove that one subsequently paid tax on the income one thereby receives.  At present, the Department already informs Revenue of all the people who receive rent supplement from it in order that Revenue can conduct a data match to ensure that those people are actually<i> post factum</i> paying tax on the rent they receive.  The Department now is adding to that system by stating that such people must provide it with their PPS number.  Consequently, when the data match takes place, it will be much quicker and much easier to identify who are those people.  I cannot disagree with much of what the Deputy said on the need to reform rent supplement.</P><Col N="97"/>
      
        <P>It has to happen.  It is happening and we are working on it.  It is a step in the right direction.  I and the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, have had a number of meetings and will pursue our reform agenda.  Regardless of how long we spend in our respective Departments it is our intention to push this agenda forward.</P>
        <P>However, I am still not convinced that paying rent supplement to the landlord on a mandatory basis is a good idea.  The tenant is the person with whom we have a relationship.  He or she has the choice to nominate a landlord or anybody else to receive the payment.  The amendment proposes to take that choice away from a tenant but there are very cogent reasons why that would not be a good idea.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 5, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) The references in this subsection to a designated centre shall include any other suitable place of treatment specified by the Minister for Health and Children.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I believe the Minister of State has considered this amendment.  I would like to know whether he is prepared to accept it.  We need to ensure that centres other than the Central Mental Hospital can be designated under this legislation.  The Central Mental Hospital is not always the best place in which to detain people.  I refer to those who are very young, for example. <Col N="99"/> Perhaps a different treatment centre could be designated for someone from the other end of the country.  I would like the Minister of State to say whether he is prepared to consider this proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>During the previous debate on this amendment, I made the point that it would have certain effects.  I would like to reiterate what they would be.  First, it would allow the District Court to send people charged with minor offences to centres other than the Central Mental Hospital for examination when an issue of fitness to be tried arises.  I recognise that is in line with the spirit of what the Deputy is saying.  Second, it would allow higher courts to send people charged with serious offences to other centres for examination where an issue of fitness to be tried arises.  Third, it would allow the District Court to order people who are unfit to be tried for minor offences to be detained in centres other than the Central Mental Hospital.  I understand the spirit of what the Deputy is suggesting.  She is alluding to the stigma associated with people being referred to the Central Mental Hospital.  I have taken up what she said on Committee Stage about the need for other centres to be designated.  Finally, it would allow higher courts to order people who are unfit to be tried for serious offences to be detained in other centres.</P>
        <P>Deputies will appreciate that this amendment would have far-reaching consequences.  I accept the principle of trying to ensure people with mental health problems are treated in less restrictive settings, if possible, as envisaged in the commitments and aspirations of A Vision for Change.  I introduced an amendment in the Seanad to give the Minister for Health and Children the power to designate centres other than the Central Mental Hospital to be used for the purposes of examining persons referred by the District Court when a question of fitness to be tried arises.  More serious difficulties arise, however, with regard to offences that are tried in the other courts.  As criminal cases before the higher courts can involve serious offences, certain security issues might arise.  Higher courts, by their nature, have an extra level of security activity.  This amendment would involve a far-reaching change to the current situation and would require careful examination by way of referral to the higher courts.  I am totally at one with the spirit of what the Deputy is suggesting by way of the lower courts.</P>
        <P>Similarly, sending persons who are unfit to be tried to centres other than the Central Mental Hospital for detention, care or treatment raises difficulties which cannot be resolved within the timescale envisaged for the enactment of this Bill.  I made the point to the Deputy on Committee Stage that the whole issue would be dealt with in the context of the planned review of the 2006 Act.  Again, we must remind ourselves that the purpose of this Bill is to make a small number of amendments to the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  Amendments to the 2006 Act are being kept to a minimum because this Bill is required urgently to deal with the whole issue of the conditional discharge of patients from the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
        <P>In a nutshell, in terms of the spirit of what Deputy Kathleen Lynch and other colleagues have mentioned in relation to the need for patients to be referred to centres other than the Central Mental Hospital, it must be recognised that there are enormous difficulties involved in the higher courts.  That is my stated position.  The broader issues raised by the amendment would be more suitably considered in the context of the planned review of the 2006 Act.  The last day we discussed this there was no talk of a general election and quite clearly people were wondering whether this would happen.  Obviously, I gave a commitment to the effect that if I was here it would happen, and I presume that when somebody else is here it will definitely happen.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy because clearly there has been widespread debate on this issue.  I fully recognise what the Deputy said on Second Stage and also on Committee Stage.  I acknowledge, too, her appreciation of the fact that people are awaiting the enactment of this legislation and I thank her very much for that also. </P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, line 12, to delete &ldquo;A person is in material breach of his or her&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;The clinical director may revoke a&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Again, I will be very brief as we already discussed this on Committee Stage.  This amendment is by way of ensuring that the director of the Central Mental Hospital would not, on a whim or based on his or her view of what might constitute a material breach of normal behaviour, recall someone who might not usually be based in the Dundrum hospital for something just a little outrageous.  It is as simple as that, to ensure that patients would not suffer from someone&rsquo; s whim of the moment or misinterpretation of the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, I fully appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns, and I do not say that purely for the sake of window dressing regarding where Deputy Kathleen Lynch is coming from.  This matter was also raised in the Seanad and, again, Deputy Lynch raised it on Committee Stage.  I cannot accept the amendment, however, and I will explain why. </P>
        <P>Section 13 of the 2006 Act, as amended by this Bill, and the new section 13A will give the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board the power to order the conditional discharge of patients.  We all welcome that.  The point at issue is that it will be for the judgment of the clinical director &mdash; it is important that the House is given clarity from my side on this &mdash; whether a person should be returned to the designated centre for further review by the review board.  To be fair, the problem appears to lie in the terminology to be used in effecting this reality.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that section 13B(2) requires the clinical director to have reasonable grounds for his or her belief that the person is in breach of a condition of the conditional discharge and either there is a likelihood of the person causing serious harm or the person is in need of inpatient care or treatment.  That is the kernel of this part, I believe.  In accordance with section 13B(1), the conditional discharge is deemed to be revoked where the person is in material breach of the order.  In other words, the review board will subsequently decide, after the person is returned to the designated centre, whether to again discharge him or her conditionally or detain the person.  It is important to make the point that the latter initiative is a safeguard to ensure the protection of the person in material breach of the conditional discharge.</P>
        <P>The difficulty with the amendment is that it would actually remove the definition of the term &ldquo;material breach&rdquo;.  The clinical director must determine on foot of such a material breach whether there are sufficient grounds for detaining a person or if a conditional discharge may again be allowed.</P>
        <P>If the amendment were to be accepted, it would unravel the structure of the section as a whole.  In other words, if the terminology were to change, this would be the effect.  Section 13B can and will work effectively in its current form and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.  Clearly, the Deputy made a very strong case on Committee Stage.  We consulted the Attorney General and that is the advice we got, which I am prepared to accept.</P>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 3 is in the names of Deputies Dan Neville and Kathleen Lynch and arises out of Committee Stage proceedings.  Amendment No. 4 is related.  Therefore, Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 may be debated together, by agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 11, line 31, to delete &ldquo;(Insanity)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(Mental Disorder)&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">We discussed this on Committee Stage as well.  The legislation is called the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill and I have difficulty with the word &ldquo;Insanity&rdquo; being used as a title.  Language is very important in terms of the way we look at mental illness and those who suffer mental ill health.  The stigma surrounding the whole area of mental illness is something which the Minister of State is very concerned about, and I compliment him on the sea change initiative he has taken.  I believe our society has cruelly failed many who are suffering from mental illness.</P>
        <P>This failure has a direct involvement in suicide as well because people do not seek help as a result of the stigma.  We do not get the same pressure in relation to the psychiatric services and the need to resource this area as we do with regard to other social difficulties.  As politicians we are faced, day in day out, with the need to resource the general health services, but rarely is the political system challenged about the resources it allocates to mental health.  Those who suffer from mental illness feel stigmatised by these attitudes and views from a time when psychiatry was not as well developed as it is today, and we must change those views.</P>
        <P>We are dealing in this legislation with only a very small percentage of patients, but there is a belief that 50% of people are in that category, which of course is ridiculous.  However, that is unfortunately the opinion of the general public in many instances.  As we have often said here, one in four persons suffers a psychiatric illness at some time in their life and such people are stigmatised by language; I want to highlight this aspect.  Using such words as &ldquo;lunatic&rdquo;, &ldquo;being mad&rdquo;, &ldquo;deranged&rdquo;, &ldquo;crazy&rdquo;, &ldquo;daft&rdquo;, &ldquo;barmy&rdquo;, &ldquo;crack-brained&rdquo;, &ldquo;nut cases&rdquo;, etc., reinforces such prejudices and the misunderstandings many people have about mental illness.</P>
        <P>The stereotyping of mentally ill patients allows fun to continue to be made of people who are suffering and facilitates continued discrimination.  We must rise above this type of abuse of language and attitudes.  Those in leadership positions must make every attempt to educate people who do not understand the pain of mental illness.  Only then will people come forward, admit the pain of the illness and seek help, similar to mainstream help in the general health service.  Only then will we demand action from Government to acknowledge the scandal of the neglect of the psychiatric services.  Until there is a watershed change of societal attitudes, many will hide their illnesses because no one wants to be referred to as &ldquo;crazy&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; also has connotations of stigmatisation.  It is a word historically used when institutions were known as hospitals for the mentally ill or mental asylums, in which straitjackets and various other types of approaches were used.  We have advanced from that and the Bill should recognise that the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; is not appropriate.  The proposal put forward by Deputy Lynch and I seeks to amend the Title of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2010 to read Criminal Law (Mental Disorder) Bill 2010.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to highlight the approach of See Change, the National Mental Health Stigma Reduction Partnership, which was launched by the Minister of State but which is not getting the attention it deserves by the media or public general, although the public in general may not be aware of it, which is the problem.  We must raise awareness of this issue.  That is the challenge facing us in terms of mental illness and the provision of mental health services.  See Change states that while anyone might experience a mental health problem at some in life, many of us are frightened of the idea of mental health problems.  The various diagnostic titles such as psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression are seen as lifelong labels <Col N="102"/>which mark a person as different from the rest of society.  The stigma and discrimination associated with significant mental health problems is for some people almost as difficult to manage as the experience of being unwell.</P>
        <P>A recent study on mental health attitudes in Ireland found that while 94% of people in Ireland believe mental health problems can affect anyone, only one in two would not want anyone to know if they had a mental illness.  There are people who say that one cannot change attitudes to mental illness but I do not believe that.  While the position in this regard has changed in recent decades it has only marginally changed.  In this regard, I always give two examples of where one can change attitudes in terms of discrimination.  We changed attitudes to tuberculosis in the 1940s, at which time no one would visit the house of a person who had TB and families of persons with TB were ignored and stigmatised.  Cancer is no longer the big &ldquo;C&rdquo;.  One can have cancer of the throat or skin and so on.  We campaign for and demand services for cancer.  I recall, as I am sure does the Minister of State, when cancer was referred to as the big &ldquo;C&rdquo;.  It was almost the unmentionable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>People would say a person had &ldquo;the other thing&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that is correct.  The word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; in this legislation should be amended.  I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  Like Deputy Lynch I do not wish to delay this Bill as it is important legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>People are waiting on this legislation to be enacted.  We are all conscious of this having been lobbied by and met with the people involved who, while not a large group, are a sincere group of people whose relatives, perhaps sons, husbands, wives and so on could, but for a lack of legislation, be at home with their families at Christmas.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Neville correctly said, language changes attitudes.  When speaking down through the years about language and how it affects different groups of people, I recall being told that one cannot change attitudes.  That may be true.  However, Jack Straw once said: &ldquo;I cannot change your attitude but I can ensure that your attitude doesn&rsquo;t detrimentally affect someone else&rdquo;.  That is the kernel of the problem.  If our language contributes to someone&rsquo;s attitude then we need to change it.  Language does change attitudes.</P>
        <P>We can all recall a time when children born outside of marriage were referred to as &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; and worse but we changed the language and in doing so we changed attitudes.  The big issue in regard to mental health is fear.  The fear is not that someone who is mentally unwell will jump out of a press and attack us but that mental illness could strike any of us.  The fear is that anyone could end up among this group of people who are stigmatised.</P>
        <P>We are producing new legislation and must surely ensure we get this right.  This is good legislation, which Deputy Neville and I are anxious is passed in the House tonight.  However, we must ensure we get it right.  To continue to refer to people as they are referred to in this legislation is wrong.  We should not refer to people who commit crimes while suffering a mental illness as &ldquo;insane&rdquo;.  What we are seeking does not change the terms of the legislation or how we treat these people and so on.  What it will do is change attitudes towards people who find themselves in this position.  If my next-door neighbour has a mental illness or is insane, how I say or react to that matters.  Language is a powerful tool.  It is said that the only thing that truly changes the world is an idea.  Language is something of which we should be conscious and in regard to which we can do something in this instance.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy Neville, I do not wish to hold up this legislation.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="103"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is possibly my second last time to speak on the issue of mental health.  I hope to get an opportunity to speak on the introduction of the mental capacity Bill.  It has been a pleasure listening to and debating reform of mental health services with Deputies Lynch and Neville during the past two and a half years.  I will give my response to the amendment later.</P>
        <P>I recall on an early occasion Deputy Neville making the point that there are no votes in mental health and that is where the difficulty lies.  It is not an issue on the doorsteps when we are canvassing.  I regret I was unable to, as requested during Committee Stage some weeks ago by Deputies Neville and Lynch, seize the moment and accept the change to the Bill.  While I was tempted to do so, clear advice was that I could not.</P>
        <P>This Bill is legislation to enable people to have recourse as quickly as possible.  There are wider issues to be dealt with.  I recall Deputy Shatter saying that while Fianna F&aacute;il has been in government for the past 15 years, it has not done much up to now.  However, there has been a change in thinking on this issue and regardless of what party will next be in government, this item will be on the agenda.  This issue has been highlighted in the major review promised.  Changing attitudes to mental health is a huge challenge.  I compliment those who have been trying to do so for years.  I acknowledge the See Change campaign which seeks to change peoples&rsquo; notions.  I have also stated publicly that there is no big deal in terms of mental health illness and in this regard spoke about my own private issue.  If we want to change attitudes, we must take a lead role in this regard.  I do not blame the media but a concerted attempt has been made by us all to change attitudes nationally through See Change.  The launch of the campaign in the Mansion House generated little interest.  People who are used to pushing the boat out retained their interest to drive the campaign, the media&rsquo;s interest was disappointing.  When I returned from a See Change campaign meeting in Donegal, I bought a copy of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I was startled to read in an editorial that See Change was regarded as nothing less than a cynical pretence on behalf of the Government.  I always open public meetings by saying there are two issues &mdash; the capital programme and the need for additional finance for mental health services.  I always say I am present as a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy taking full responsibility for the need for further resources but I always highlight that the stigma issue is separate because all the funding in the world means nothing if people are reluctant to present for support.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge reference to changing attitudes sounds hollow.  I am the Minister of State responsible and the question can rightly be posed: Why can I not do that?  I ask Members to bear with me.  On Second Stage, I explained that the purpose of the Bill is to deal with two issues that have arisen in the operation of the 2006 Act, which require urgent attention.  I took the opportunity to seek the co-operation of the House and I thank Members for confining amendments to strictly what was necessary to achieve that purpose.  I also explained that the other issues were being tabled for examination in the context of the major review of the 2006 Act planned to commence following the enactment of this legislation.  This is a serious commitment for whoever takes up my seat and it will be followed up on to take into account the need to move from the language issue and the connotations involved.</P>
        <P>I understand why the amendments have been tabled and I have sympathy for them because these issues have been raised on the floor of the See Change meetings throughout the country.  People talk about the notion of the tags that attach and the fact that when they apply for a mortgage or a loan, they are asked for their medical history and are reluctant to divulge details lest it might create a difficulty for them.  I accept the spirit of the amendments and I should say I will go with that but there are implications for criminal law.  I do not hang my coat out to say that.</P><Col N="104"/>
        <P>I have sought and received the agreement of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform that this issue will be examined in the context of the planned review.  &ldquo;Examined&rdquo; might be a loose word but it will be considered in the context of how the legal implications can be removed.  The rejection of the amendments must, therefore, be seen for what it is; it is a deferral of the matter for consideration in a more suitable context and I ask the Deputies to accept that.  I hope they can appreciate this because this will allow us to examine this issue in the context of the 2006 Act as a whole and to ensure that suitable consideration is given to the legal issues involved before we move to accept a change to the terminology, which has a long-standing meaning in criminal law.  These are complex issues associated with replacing the term &ldquo;insanity&rdquo;.  The provisions relating to the specific verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity under section 5 of the 2006 Act were drafted on the basis of the decided judicial authority on the precise circumstances in which persons with mental illness would be excused from criminal liability.</P>
        <P>Some of us had been under the impression that the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; is defined in the 2006 Act but this is not the case.  Section 5(1)(<i>b</i>) provides for the special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity and the requirements of this verdict are not only that the accused person is suffering a type of mental illness but also the mental disorder is such that he or she ought not to be held responsible for the act alleged by the person for the reason that he or she did not know the nature and quality of the act or did not know what he or she was doing or he or she was unable to refrain from committing that act.</P>
        <P>The issue for the court is fundamentally one of legal responsibility and that is where my difficulty lies.  If there was no legal implication whatsoever, we would go with the amendments because it would give a sense to the notion of removing the stigma.  The plea of insanity in law is an excuse rather than a condition.  It is a factor that excuses liability from the commission of a crime.  Our law places the matter firmly within legal parameters directly related to personal responsibility for one&rsquo;s actions.  In this scenario, medical evidence is influential but not decisive and this means that an accused person who has been diagnosed as suffering from a mental disorder in the medical sense may fail to satisfy the criteria for insanity under the criminal law.  I must rely on this advice because this has implications.</P>
        <P>We have to be careful we do not let a situation develop where a jury would arrive at a view that any mental disorder, regardless of how trivial it may be, could provide grounds for acquittal.  The 2006 Act laid down a high threshold and we have to be careful that substituting the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; with &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;, for instance, would not send a signal that the threshold is being significantly lowered.  Criminal law is the main focus of this Act.  It could be misleading to change the title to refer to &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;, the term primarily used to decide if a person is in need of care and treatment in a psychiatric hospital and which is the primary focus of the Mental Health Act 2001.  While an aspect of that is a focus of the 2006 Act, it is not the primary focus.  We, therefore, have to be careful not to introduce any doubt or uncertainty.</P>
        <P>I assure the House the name changing issue is firmly on the agenda but I cannot be any stronger than that.  I fully accept what the Deputies said and I fully support the case they have made but because of the legal implications, I cannot give the nod to the amendments.  I would dearly love to be the Minister of State who makes the change but I cannot do so on the basis of the advice I have.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the important issue of the reorganisation and restriction of emergency services at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15.  The hospital is situated beside the M50 and it serves a vast hinterland, including most of Dublin 15 and north county Dublin up to the Ashbourne Road, the Navan Road, Finglas, Cabra in the city and large tracts of counties Meath and Kildare.  The hospital is at the centre of Ireland&rsquo;s key population growth over the past 15 years.  People from all over the region have come to depend on the hospital for primary medical care and staff at all levels have striven to develop the hospital over the years in face of different and constant pressures.</P>
        <P>The hospital was starved by the Minister for Health and Children of critically important investment in infrastructure such as modern diagnostic equipment, which is taken for granted in hospitals the world over.  I have waged a long campaign to secure an MRI scanner for the hospital.  However, that type of up-to-date diagnostic equipment was referred by a ministerial order of the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, to the private hospital that was due to be co-located in the grounds.  Like the Celtic tiger economy and the bubble, that co-located hospital has vanished into the mist.</P>
        <P>The issue about the hospital that most concerns local people and those in the Blanchardstown hinterland is the suggestion that 24-hour accident and emergency cover is to be withdrawn and consolidated within other hospitals.  In particular, there have been suggestions about a partnership between Beaumont Hospital and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland teaching centre of excellence which would mean a shift to Beaumont Hospital being the primary hospital in the new arrangement.  According to a memorandum circulated to staff at James Connolly Memorial Hospital on 29 November last, the HSE intends to progress a full impact assessment, cost-benefit analysis, detailed planning and initial engagement regarding the phased reduction in 24-hour emergency departments in north Dublin from the current three sites to two sites.  The three sites are James Connolly Memorial Hospital, the Mater Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.</P>
        <P>Given the critical position of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital on the M50 and the fact that, unfortunately, gunshot injuries are a large issue in west Dublin and the hospital has developed a specialisation in this area which is recognised throughout Europe and the world and that these incidents tend to happen at night, what is happening in this review is worrying people in the area.  The HSE memorandum states clearly that no decisions have been made with regard to the emergency service in James Connolly Memorial Hospital.  I received a reply from the public affairs division of the HSE which indicated that the HSE is merely considering these issues at present.</P>
        <P>While the notion of a co-located campus definitely has the possibility of introducing many savings, nonetheless certain key services are important.  How advanced is this process?  When is a final decision expected to be made?  Will hospital staff and local people be consulted about the changes or are they to be presented with a <i>fait accompli</i>?  Will the Minister publish the capacity study completed this year on the development of emergency services based at James <Col N="106"/>Connolly Memorial Hospital?  When they are completed will the Minister publish the impact assessment and the cost-benefit analysis for any new arrangements?  Can the Minister give a commitment that the people who depend on the emergency services based at James Connolly Memorial Hospital will not suffer any diminution in these services that would put lives or the quality of patient care at risk in any way?</P>
        <P>The staff in the hospital have been extremely co-operative with the change management process that is currently ongoing.  As I said, the hospital serves a very large hinterland, including large parts of Dublin 7 and Finglas, the Dublin 15 area, north Dublin through to the Ashbourne Road and very large areas of both Meath and Kildare given what has happened to hospitals in Meath.  People and the staff in James Connolly Memorial Hospital, where there is an exceptionally positive environment, deserve a considered response from the Minister.</P>

	<P>I will make every effort to give a considered response and to answer the questions posed by the Deputy.  I apologise for the fact that my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, cannot be here to respond.</P>
        <P>The HSE has recently been considering how best to reform the way services are provided in Dublin North while reducing costs, maintaining a clear focus on patient safety, allowing people to be treated in more effective ways and protecting access to appropriate services.  The way in which accident and emergency services are delivered in the region has recently been considered by the HSE in this regard.  No decisions relating to the potential impact on any of the sites, including at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, have been made.</P>
        <P>International trends point toward the provision of fewer emergency departments, based within larger hospitals that are focused on acute care services.  There are potential advantages to having hospitals that specialise in elective, non-emergency care.  Having protected beds for non-emergency care can eliminate the cancellation of procedures and operations which frequently occur when emergency patients have to be admitted to the beds.  Reduced cancellations means that medical staff can schedule more patients, confident in the knowledge that beds will be available as planned.  This allows the emergency hospital to focus primarily on acute care and so provide a better care experience to emergency patients.</P>
        <P>However, such advantages must be weighed against the needs of the local population.  The HSE intends to undertake a full impact assessment and cost-benefit analysis of any change to emergency department services.  This will require detailed planning and engagement with a wide range of interested parties.  The HSE has stressed that this project is at a very early stage and no decisions have yet been taken on the future of any particular service.</P>
        <P>I do not have the specific information sought by the Deputy.  I will respond to her within a few days.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me and Deputies Breen and Dooley the opportunity to raise this important issue.</P>
        <P>As late as last May at a Western Regional Health Forum meeting, the HSE stated that there was to be no change to the services currently offered at Ennis General Hospital.  The re-<Col N="107"/>organisation of acute services in the mid-west came about as a result of both the Teamwork and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, reports into the breast cancer misdiagnoses of the late Ms Ann Moriarty and the late Ms Edel Kelly.  At the launch of the HIQA report, Dr. Alan McKinney, a member of the HIQA Ennis investigation team, stated: &ldquo;Before transferring a hospital service, it must be ensured there is a safer, better alternative available.  There is no point making things worse than they are now&rdquo;.  However, hospital services are being closed on the cheap without adequate resources being provided in the major centres or so-called centres of excellence, in this case in Limerick.  This questionable practice presents us with the dangerous scenario of ultimately ending up with nothing at both county and regional level and endangering the patient, according to Dr. McKinney&rsquo;s hypothesis.</P>
        <P>What has the Minister done about the major capital works outlined in the Teamwork report with regard to Limerick Regional Hospital?  She has done very little.  Why are there regularly up to 50 patients on trolleys in Limerick Regional Hospital?  Why must patients wait for months for MRI scans in that hospital?  Where is the better cardiac service for Limerick?  Is there a 24-hour emergence cath lab service in Limerick Regional Hospital?  There is not.  Why strip the service in County Clare and replace it with nothing?</P>
        <P>Prior to accident and emergency services reconfiguration in April 2009, I vividly recall the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE ploughing ahead with their strategy without even putting in place a proper ambulance service for the people of County Clare.  They were happy to pursue this course until Dr. Paul Burke appeared on a &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme and outlined the reality.  That is the level of commitment displayed to date &mdash; try to do things on the cheap, unless one is questioned.</P>
        <P>The reconfiguration process has been ongoing for more than 18 months.  It is time to have an independent evaluation of the process.</P>
      
        <P>I am asking that HIQA officials be called in to evaluate where we are on reconfiguration.  Has the Government delivered on patient care?  I do not think it has.  It has delivered on saving money, but it has not delivered on the patients.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I also wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating the Clare Deputies in what is an important issue for us.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate tonight.  Concern has been raised with me and other public representatives in the past number of days regarding the possible downgrading of cardiac services at Ennis General Hospital.  As the Minister of State here tonight is aware, Ennis General Hospital has seen significant change in services provided in recent years.  It has been always based on patient safety and the quality assured service that should be delivered at any particular time.  The core of this whole reconfiguration process has been the necessity to ensure the service is quality assured and is in the best interests of the patient.</P>
        <P>The transfer of acute surgery to the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick was brought about by a number of misdiagnosed cases at Ennis that had tragic outcomes for patient safety and the quality of the service.  All of us have recognised the importance of that.  However, as part of that reconfiguration process, it had been always recognised that many services could be delivered at Ennis General Hospital in the best interests of patients and in a safe environment.  In particular, it was recognised that Ennis would play an important role in the delivery of medical services, and that included some acute services.  In my view, cardiology is one such medical service that can and should remain at Ennis.  Nobody has put forward to me any case for moving the service.</P>
        <P>I accept that interventional cardiology is by necessity delivered at a hospital such as the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick, where CAT labs and other enhanced technologies are <Col N="108"/>available to provide that service.  However, I see no reason the current service in Ennis should be in any way diminished or removed.  It does not make sense from a cost point of view, from a patient safety point of view, or from any other point of view.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children met with me and the Minister for Defence this evening.  She gave us a fair hearing.  She allowed us to put forward a very strong case for the retention of the service, and she recognised the necessity to continue to build on the services that are delivered in Ennis, so that the reconfiguration process can continue.  It will not be possible for Limerick to manage the entire services of the region.  It is just not physically possible to do it, and it is important that services are maintained in both Ennis and Nenagh, and enhanced rather than reduced.  I look forward to what the Minister has to say this evening, given that she has had the opportunity to hear the three Clare Deputies this evening, and more particularly, given that she had a face to face meeting with the Minister for Defence and myself where we put forward the case on behalf of the people we all represent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak tonight on this important issue for County Clare.  We all know that when the Government made the decision to reconfigure services to the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick, it signed the death warrant for the future of Ennis General Hospital as an acute medical hospital.  I am delighted to see Deputy Dooley raise his concerns tonight, like the two of us on this side of the House.  When the &euro;14 million upgrading work started in the hospital earlier this year, I recall reading Deputy Dooley in the newspaper saying it was a vote of confidence for the retention of Ennis as an acute medical hospital.  How could that be so?  Ennis has been stripped of acute surgery.  The 24 hour acute accident and emergency service is gone, as is intensive care.  We are told that on 1 February, the cardiac services, including the high-dependency unit, will be transferred to the Mid-Western Regional Hospital as part of the HSE&rsquo;s plan to centralise cardiac services.</P>
        <P>It is very easy to forget the &euro;30 million promised by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, when he breezed into County Clare during the general election campaign in 2007.  What happened the other &euro;25 million?  Did it disappear into a black hole?</P>
        <P>The transfer of cardiology services was contained in the small print of the HSE&rsquo;s action plan for acute and community health services published in 2008 and supported by the Government.  However, this was not supposed to happen until facilities at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital  were put into place.  This clearly has not happened.  The sod has only just been turned on the new critical care unit.  The CAT scan laboratory, which was supposed to operate at the hospital on a 24 hour basis, is operating from 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m only.  Clearly, the logic for centralising cardiac services depends very much on this system being put in place, so that a CAT scan can be read within two hours.  Those of us who visit the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick can see it is like a building site at the moment, and there is a very serious shortage of parking spaces there.  There is also a huge shortage of beds and severe crowding in the accident and emergency department.  This evening, there were 24 patients waiting on trolleys in Limerick, while there were nine patients waiting in Ennis this afternoon.  The ambulance personnel are doing an excellent job, but they will not be able to cope when this change comes into place without being given additional personnel and resources.  They are already overstretched.</P>
        <P>I understand that 1 February is the date set for the transfer of these services.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy Killeen, and Deputy Dooley had a meeting this evening with the Minister for Health and Children.  It looks like that may be put on hold until after the general election.  Maybe that is being done so as not to hurt the Government Deputies in the constituency.</P>
        <P>When will the 24 hour CAT scan laboratory be put in place at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick?  Galway already has the facility.  What plans has the Minister in place for <Col N="109"/>Ennis General Hospital?  What is the future of inpatient services at the hospital?  Will it be just a day surgical hospital?  I fear that when the cardiac services at Ennis General Hospital are transferred to Limerick, it will be the nail in the coffin for acute services at Ennis.  We want these questions answered tonight in the interests of patient safety, as we are all concerned about that in County Clare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>Patient safety is central to the delivery of health services.  People must have confidence in the care they receive and have the best possible outcomes.  The way in which we deliver acute hospital services to our communities and their wider regions is changing.</P>
        <P>The HSE has made significant progress in re-organising acute hospital and related services in the mid-west region since April 2009.  While this has involved the relocation of some more complex services to the Mid-Western Regional Hospital at Dooradoyle, in the interests of patient safety and quality, Ennis General Hospital, as part of the regional hospital network, now undertakes an expanded range of day case surgery and diagnostic work.  The Minister is anxious that the range of such services provided in Ennis General Hospital should continue to be expanded, so that people can have most of their health care needs met as close as possible to where they live.</P>
        <P>All the cardiology services currently available in Ennis General Hospital will continue.  The future of these services at Ennis General Hospital is secure and they will continue to be provided by a specialist cardiology team.  In fact, these services will be expanded further, with the addition of cardiac failure clinics and cardiac rehabilitation services for patients who have had the acute phase of their illness managed in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick.</P>
        <P>In deciding on the best model for the provision of cardiac services in the region, the unanimous medical advice is to centralise acute cardiology to the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick.  This is in line with the model being developed in the region, whereby services are organised on an integrated regional basis, delivered in a range of locations and settings.  To facilitate this, a fourth cardiologist is being appointed.  This will facilitate a separate cardiology rota, giving patients access to a cardiologist on a 24-hour basis for emergency cases in the region.</P>
        <P>Interventional cardiology will be performed in the designated cardiac catheterisation laboratory in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick, thereby enabling patients to receive the best possible care in the event of an acute cardiac episode.  Six additional inpatient cardiology beds will be designated in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital to support this service.  These developments will be brought on stream in the course of 2011, after the fourth cardiologist has taken up duty.  General medical services will continue to be provided at Ennis, and the majority of medical patients, including respiratory patients, will continue to be treated at the hospital.</P>
        <P>Ennis General Hospital has recently been a recipient of significant investment, with the installation of a CT scanner at a cost of &euro;900,000, which became operational in 2009.  In addition, an endoscopy suite for day medical procedures, at a total cost of &euro;2.5 million, is under construction and is due to be completed by April 2011.  The HSE has received planning permission for a new ward block containing 50 replacement beds.  It is estimated that the construction of these facilities, which will cost &euro;8 million, will be completed by the end of 2011.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the HSE recognise the importance of Ennis General Hospital and the contribution it has made and will continue to make to the provision of hospital services in the region.  Ennis General Hospital is a pivotal component in the provision of acute services in the <Col N="110"/>mid-west.  I assure the House on the Minister&rsquo;s behalf that there will be no reduction in the level of cardiology services provided at Ennis General Hospital and that it will continue to play an important role in the provision of health services to the population of the mid-west region.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach today tried to minimise what was revealed in the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme showing the neglect and abuse of older people by private home care providers under contract to the HSE.  He spoke of four cases, as if it concerned only four older people.  This is a total misrepresentation.  The programme covered two major home care providers which were given the task of caring for a large number of older people.  It also investigated the cases of a number of individual older people whose experience is clearly representative of others who have experienced the gross inadequacy of the home care being provided by some agencies and individuals in the State.  People were justifiably appalled by these revelations, and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to them is totally inadequate.  Among those appalled at the revelations are the many genuine and professional carers in both the public and private sector, who should be fully recognised and acknowledged.</P>
        <P>An important first step in response to this scandal would be for the Government to admit that this has come about as a direct result of Government policy and HSE negligence.  As far back as 2004, an evaluation of home care in the then Eastern Regional Health Authority area was carried out by Dr. Virpi Timonen.  In his report, published by the ERHA itself, Dr. Timonen recommended that there should be more careful monitoring of the quality and adequacy of the services.  His report highlighted the lack of national standards for any form of home care service.  Dr. Timonen stated in his report:</P>
        <P LI="1">Inadequacy of basic home help services, due to funding constraints, recruitment difficulties and lack of adequate structures, is causing a problem.  Large numbers of older people in need of help experience problems accessing services.  Lack of adequate day care and respite care services, and the uneven distribution of these services across the country, also poses a problem.</P>
        <P FLI="0">One of the main motives behind the introduction of the home care grants was responding to unmet care needs resulting from the absence or inadequacy of other services.  The lack of comprehensive services, the uneven distribution of services and the structural problems identified in 2004 were not fixed.  They have still not been fixed.  Instead, Government and HSE policy has become increasingly reliant on putting public money into the private for-profit home care sector, which has now grown to some 150 companies across the State.</P>
        <P>Is the Government proud of the fact that last week it reduced the minimum wage, putting more money in the pockets of the type of shark we saw on the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme &mdash; people posing as care providers who exploit untrained and unqualified care workers, many of them immigrants, by paying minimum or below-minimum wages?  In one case a person was illegally paid &euro;4.88 per hour; another was paid &euro;300 for a month&rsquo;s full-time work. <Col N="111"/> This surely exposes the disgracefully low value placed on the work of caring for our older citizens.  It is at one with the shameful decision in last week&rsquo;s budget to cut carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit by another &euro;8 per week.  There has been a total reduction of more than &euro;16 per week in each benefit since 2009.</P>
        <P>We should all be greatly concerned at the standard of care for older people in general and at some &mdash; but by no means all &mdash; of the people who have got involved in it as a profitable business rather than as a caring profession.  We must ask what will be done to ensure that HIQA and the HSE have the ability and the resources to prevent such abuse either in nursing homes or in people&rsquo;s own homes.</P>
        <P>To give but one example, the HSE has coerced all but a few of the residents of Loughloe House in Athlone to leave, despite their desire to remain and a community campaign to keep this public facility open for current and future residents.  HIQA did not recommend that this facility close, but the HSE, pursuing Government policy, is determined that it will.  Home care packages were offered to the residents as one of their options.</P>
        <P>The home care scandal exposes the abject failure of this Government&rsquo;s policy of privatising health and personal social services.  These private for-profit companies are receiving millions of euro every year from the HSE.  Apart from the pittance paid to care staff, this public money is going into the pockets of the owners.  Therefore, I call on the Government to take four steps as follows: it must put in place, without further delay and on a statutory basis, regulations for the home care sector; empower and provide the resources for HIQA to monitor compliance with these regulations; establish proper qualifications, pay and conditions for home care workers; and change Government policy from privatisation to direct provision of home care by the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, who cannot be here this evening.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for raising the matter.</P>
        <P>I am sure all Members of the House will join with me in expressing concern at the incidents highlighted in the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme last night.  The central focus of Government policy for older people who need care is that they should be able to receive high-quality care and they should be at the centre of all decisions regarding their care.  The key element that must exist between the provider of care, whether public or private, and the recipient of that care is trust.  This is fundamental to any service, but particularly health or personal social services, whose recipients are likely to be vulnerable.  As an immediate response, the HSE is investigating the cases raised in last night&rsquo;s programme and is now reviewing all service delivery under its auspices to ensure that proper standards of care are being met.  The executive will terminate contracts and change providers in cases in which this is necessary.</P>
        <P>I emphasise, however, that in the vast majority of cases the HSE works in a close and beneficial partnership with high-quality home care providers in the non-State sectors.  The HSE also has complaint mechanisms and an elder abuse network.  In responding to referrals, the HSE provides a discreet and confidential service which may include counselling, mediation and anger management, as appropriate.  Anyone who encounters elder abuse or inadequate care should report it to a GP, a HSE social worker, a public health nurse, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or anyone they trust.  The introduction of the nursing homes support scheme and the bringing into force of new regulatory standards for the long-term residential care sector demonstrates the priority the Government places on high-quality services for older people.  Notwithstanding the severe financial pressures of recent times, there has been an expansion of the home care package initiative nationally through the provision of an additional &euro;10 million in 2010 and a further &euro;8 million in budget 2011.  This year we protected the levels of other <Col N="112"/>community-based supports for older people, such as home help, meals on wheels and day or respite care, and we also intend to do so in 2011.</P>
        <P>With regard to the possible regulation of home care services, the July 2008 report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance recommended, among other things, the extension of any licensing systems in health care to the primary, community and continuing care sector.  More recently, in July 2009, the Law Reform Commission published a consultation paper entitled Legal Aspects of Carers.  This considers the legal issues surrounding home care and makes several provisional recommendations in the area of standards and regulations generally.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children accepts the need for a more standardised approach to the regulation of home care generally, whether by statutory or non-statutory providers.  The HSE and the Department have progressed various improvements in home care provision overall during 2010, especially relating to the governance of services.  These measures will be published and implemented in 2011 and include national guidelines and procedures for standardised implementation of the home care packages scheme, quality guidelines for home care support services for older people and national guidelines for the home help service.  In addition, the HSE published its public procurement framework for home care services on 22 October last and is progressing this important measure, in conjunction with the other measures I have outlined, to ensure best provision to clients.  Approved providers must meet and be monitored on a range of standards such as vetting, training, elder abuse protocols, supervision and client feedback.</P>
        <P>As indicated to the House in a reply to a parliamentary question on 22 June last, the question of possible changes to legislation, including regulation and inspection, for the area of home care for older people generally is under consideration.  The Department is examining the regulation of this sector in the overall context of the licensing of health care providers.  Legislation is currently being prepared in this regard, taking into account the recommendations of the Commission on Patient Safety and the Law Reform Commission.  The Government is determined to do everything possible to protect all older people in care.  Our approach is to progress the various initiatives I have outlined, while examining the options and implications of introducing statutory regulation.  I assure the House that the Department of Health and Children will work closely with relevant statutory and non-statutory organisations to take all measures necessary to ensure quality standards for all people receiving home care.</P>

	<P>Based on the positive evaluation of the original Dial to Stop Drug Dealing campaign, the ongoing support of the Garda&iacute; and positive community feedback, I decided to relaunch the campaign with a more national focus. In this regard, on 6 October last I announced a two week national promotional campaign, to be followed by local campaigns at Drugs Task Force level.  All the local campaigns have run, with the final one just having started on 13th December. </P>
        <P>My belief in the campaign has been justified with a new record being set in October last for the number of calls received since the phone line opened in September 2008 &mdash; over 800 calls and 285 reports to the Garda&iacute;.  Calls in November totalled 553 with 179 reports, also a very high level.  From September 2008 to date, a total of 8,684 calls have been made to the phone line with 2,485 reports generated.  Calls received have been spread right across the country, including areas that that have not run a campaign.</P>
        <P>I believe very strongly in the notion that communities should be empowered and should feel enabled to make a stand in a way that they need never fear will impact negatively on them.  The Dial to Stop Drug Dealing Campaign is one measure to support local communities in this regard.</P>
        <P>A full evaluation of the current phase of the Dial to Stop Drug Dealing campaign will be carried out on its completion at the end of the year.</P>

	<P>The main objectives of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy, and the individual measures under the Programme, including indicative allocations, are as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Diversification into non-agricultural activities for farm families<b> &mdash; </b>  &euro;16.66m;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Support for business creation and development &mdash; &euro;48.26m;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Encouragement of tourism activities &mdash; &euro;45.4m;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Basic services for the economy and rural population &mdash; &euro;49.61m;</P>
            <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Village renewal and development &mdash; &euro;54.2m;</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Conservation and upgrading of the rural heritage &mdash; &euro;51.7m;</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Training and information on adapted and new skills &mdash; &euro;29.45m; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Implementing co-operation projects<b> </b>  &mdash; &euro;10.7m.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I am pleased with the progress to date under the RDP, which continues to facilitate access to significant financial resources for rural communities since it started in 2009. This has resulted in the proliferation of innovative and sustainable development projects all over the country, which are providing invaluable support to rural communities in these difficult times and there is no question of funds being diverted away from the RDP. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that the issue of requesting permission from the EU to channel funds through County Enterprise Boards does not arise.</P>
        <P>The RDP currently has registered project activity of &euro;80m, with almost &euro;30m at an advanced stage of development. Expenditure to date amounts to over &euro;50m, which includes funding for a diverse range of projects from support for micro-enterprise in rural areas to the build and maintenance of community infrastructure and the provision of training in a variety of disciplines for rural dwellers. I am confident that the activity funded under the RDP to date is contributing to the creation of the right conditions for the generation of sustainable, long-term job opportunities in rural areas.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to work with all relevant Departments, agencies and rural communities, through their Local Action Groups, to maximise all possible funding opportunities under the RDP.</P>

	<P>I am informed by Waterways Ireland that the 2011 Sponsorship Programme was advertised the week beginning 1st November 2010.  The Waterways Ireland Sponsorship Programme aims to increase <Col N="115"/>participation levels and frequency of use of the waterways under its remit by supporting a wide range of events.  </P>
        <P>By supporting events through the Sponsorship Programme, Waterways Ireland assists in bringing tourists to the waterways and their hinterland and thus provides an economic stimulus to the communities living along the waterways.</P>
        <P>Support is provided to events on the basis of:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />location and nature of the event (which must be water-based on one of the seven waterways under the remit of Waterways Ireland);</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />potential of the event to introduce new users to the waterways in an active capacity, i.e. not merely as spectators;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />development of non-established events;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />encouraging cross-border participation;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />even distribution of sponsorship across all activities and all waterways; and</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />inclusion of participants from specified groups (such as people with dependents, people with a disability and members of the Traveller community) and from people of different ages, political opinion, race, religious belief, gender, marital status, and sexual orientation.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The closing date for receipt of completed applications for sponsorship was Monday 13th December 2010 at 3.00 p.m. and assessment of received applications will take place in the coming weeks. I am arranging for the Deputy to be advised in due course as to the number of applications that were received in total.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 141, 143 and 144 of 24 Samhain 2010, his views regarding the data supplied by the Health Research Board showing the high level of drug use here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>As indicated in my previous reply, the data to which the Deputy refers is primarily drawn from the 2010 annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), with the Health Research Board being the national agency through which the Irish input is channelled.</P>
        <P>For the reasons outlined, I again stress the need for caution when using data to derive cross-European comparisons.  Also, the Irish input on heroin is based on a study published by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) in December 2009.  As indicated at the time, due to a number of technical factors associated with the capture/recapture methodology used, the figures were regarded as an overestimate of the opiate-using population here. The NACD are currently undertaking research aimed at identifying an appropriate estimate model for use in Ireland, taking the data sources available into consideration.</P>
        <P>I accept that heroin use remains a major problem in our country.  All the indications are that, while the use of heroin is relatively stable in the Dublin region, it has become more widely dispersed around the country, particularly in the major cities and in towns across Leinster. The data under reference also emphasises the welcome increase in the number of people who are <Col N="116"/>in receipt of treatment to deal with their drugs problems.  As I pointed out previously, new opiate substitution services have opened this year in Cork, Tralee and Wexford, and these will be followed shortly by facilities in Kilkenny, Waterford, Limerick, Dundalk and Drogheda. Expansions of needle exchange services, detoxification facilities and rehabilitation services are also being implemented.</P>
        <P>While the Drugs Prevalence Survey 2006/07 showed an increase in cocaine use, the data is being updated at present with fieldwork for the Drugs Prevalence Survey 2010/11 being undertaken.  The initial outcomes from that survey will come to hand towards the end of next year.  Ireland ranks in the mid-range among the EU countries for cannabis use, while the use of ecstasy is considered to be at a low level.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the steps being taken across the supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research pillars of the National Drugs Strategy will continue to impact significantly on problem drug use in Ireland.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding the development of the strategy under the supply reduction pillar of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 to develop a framework to provide an appropriate response to the issue of drug related intimidation in communities; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>An Action was included under the supply reduction pillar of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 &mdash; <i>develop a framework to provide an appropriate response to the issue of drug-related intimidation in the community</i>   &mdash; with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na taking the lead role and also involving the Family Support Network and the Department of Justice and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have developed such a framework in co-operation with the other parties.  The implementation of the framework on a pilot basis in the Dublin Metropolitan Area was announced at the Annual Work Conference of the Family Support Network, which I attended in October.  The framework has been well received by the family representatives and its implementation in 2011 will be monitored with a view to possible expansion to the rest of the country.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, the Dial to Stop Drug Dealing Campaign, which I recently relaunched, is a further measure to support local communities in dealing with drugs problems in their midst. The campaign was devised as a safe and anonymous way for concerned citizens to pass information to the Garda&iacute; who see it as an effective means of helping in the effort against drug dealing and the associated suffering in communities. Information given through the confidential line has led to a number of seizures, and has contributed greatly to Garda intelligence in the drugs area.</P>
        <P>The issue of drug-related intimidation is something that is associated with the drugs trade on an international level.  It is a most difficult issue to address in a comprehensive way but I am confident that the steps being taken will lead to improvements in the lives of many families.  Meanwhile, I will continue to monitor the situation through the quarterly meetings of the Oversight Forum on Drugs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 56 together. </P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, my Department has, over the past number of years, been pursuing a process of cohesion of local delivery structures in order to simplify and enhance the effectiveness of the delivery of a range of local development programmes.</P>
        <P>The realignment of local delivery structures has reduced the overall number of local development bodies from 94 to 52. These comprise 15 Local Development Companies (LDCs) in urban areas and 37 integrated LEADER/LDC bodies in rural areas.  These entities are all independent companies limited by guarantee.</P>
        <P>The current phase of this work, which is now well advanced, is focused on integrating the various Community Development Projects across the country with the LDCs and this process, which has been the subject of extensive engagement with the various stakeholders, is due to be completed by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>In this context, the Deputies may be aware that a national model involving full integration was set out by my Department. However, it was made clear that other options could be considered as long as they meet a range of criteria, including reduced structures, better integrated delivery of services, supporting efficiencies and reducing company law compliance requirements for CDPs. To date, I have approved four alternative models put forward by HSE South, the Limerick City CDPs/Paul Partnership, the Women&rsquo;s Sector CDPs and Northside Partnership. <Col N="118"/> A small number of other alternative models remain under active consideration by my Department and the groups involved will be advised of the outcome shortly.</P>
        <P>In terms of the work of the LDCs, my Department has extensive and ongoing engagement with the companies and provides funding to them to implement a number of programmes which enhance their capacity to be key facilitators of development in their respective areas. These programmes include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) which superseded the Local Development Social Inclusion and the Community Development Programmes from the beginning of this year.   As part of its overall goals, the LCDP supports individuals into employment and self-employment through education, training, work experience, job placement, enterprise and the social economy in urban and rural areas.  Funding of &euro;67.5m has been made available in 2010 for the Programme.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 under which funding of the order of &euro;425m is available.  The main objectives of the Programme are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy.  Funding is available under a number of specific measures, which include, for example, the encouragement of tourism activities, support for business creation and development, village renewal and development and basic services for the economy and the rural population. The Programme has facilitated access to significant financial resources to rural communities since it commenced. This has resulted in the proliferation of innovative and sustainable development projects all over the country, which are providing invaluable support to rural communities in these difficult times.</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department will continue to work closely with the companies over the coming years to assist them in achieving positive outcomes for the communities they serve. As I have said in the past, my primary concern is to make every effort by minimising overheads and ancillary costs to ensure that the front-line services provided by &mdash; or supported through &mdash; my Department, especially those focused on the needs of the most disadvantaged communities, are protected.</P>

        <P>The main week took place from 17th to 21st of October and was led by the local authorities. The objective was to showcase best practice in local social inclusion initiatives and the work of the Social Inclusion Units that are in place in many local authorities, and to highlight the role of active citizenship in promoting greater social inclusion. Funding of &euro;47,600 was made available by my Department to support the work.  Twenty eight local authorities received &euro;1,700 each to assist with their arrangements for the week.</P>
        <P>I was impressed by the range of activities that took place and the way in which they sought to meet the principal objectives of the Year, which include involving every level of society in the work against social exclusion. Events included community competitions, exhibitions, workshops and projects to raise awareness about the impact of social exclusion in communities. There were also information initiatives about Traveller culture, ethnic diversity, homelessness and the work of the local authorities to bring about an inclusive society.  Events aimed to reach out to older people, youth, and people with disabilities and promote their participation in their local community. Initiatives involved all levels of the community and included local schools, libraries, childcare providers, family resource centres, local businesses and sports clubs.</P>
        <P>I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the local authorities, community groups and local voluntary organisations for their response and their commitment to the success of the Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department operates a range of programmes and schemes to assist and <Col N="120"/>support community, local and rural development.  This includes programmes and activities supportive of rural tourism and the rural recreation agenda.  </P>
        <P>In particular, the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP), which my Department administers, represents a substantial investment in rural areas and indeed will play a significant role in terms of sustaining and developing rural tourism over the coming period. Under the programme, an amount of &euro;45.4m is available for the <i>Encouragement of Tourism Activities</i>  measure, which aims to encourage rural tourism built on the sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s natural resources, cultural and natural heritage. The objective of this measure is to maximise the sustainable, regionally balanced, tourism potential of all rural areas through the provision of necessary infrastructure and the development of the countryside as a recreational resource for all.  The measure currently has registered project activity of &euro;11 million, with almost &euro;8 million at an advanced stage of development. This activity has the potential to leverage in excess of &euro;9 million in private matched funding.</P>
        <P>My Department also co-ordinates the work of Comhairle na Tuaithe, which oversees the implementation of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy. The investments in this area also contribute significantly to the rural tourism product, especially activity tourism.</P>
        <P>The implementation of my Department&rsquo;s Walks Scheme, as the first managed maintenance scheme for our walking trails, has seen a great improvement in the facilities and standards in this area. There are now nearly 40 trails covered by the Scheme. It should be noted that my Department has also contributed to a number of other rural recreation initiatives such as the development of certain disused railway lines as cycle/walkways, the Mayo Greenway being a recent such example.</P>
        <P>My Department also supports the Irish Summer Colleges, which provide Irish courses in the Gaeltacht each year and are central to the promotion of rural cultural tourism in those areas. In 2010, over 24,000 students attended courses in the Gaeltacht and were accommodated in over 600 households throughout the region. Activities associated with the colleges, as well as various local events centred around them, and visiting parents, relatives, etc, provide a tremendous boost to the local Gaeltacht economy each year, as well as assisting in strengthening the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, the most important natural resource of the area.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which comes under the remit of my Department, has also made a significant contribution to rural tourism and the rural economy in the Gaeltact regions.</P>
        <P>I should add that Waterways Ireland, a North/South Implementation Body, which is co-sponsored by my Department, is also engaged in the promotion and development of rural tourism within the context of its particular mandate in relation to the development of our inland waterways, which are a valuable and precious tourism resource. Waterways Ireland is currently formulating a new Marketing Strategy for the inland waterways, which will build on the many successes of previous marketing activities and will strengthen the relationships built up over the last decade with tourism agencies, local authorities, product providers and the private sector.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to contribute to rural recreation and tourism and will work with the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport and other key agencies, such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in this regard over the coming period. In this regard, I anticipate that the significantly increased funding available for tourism development under the RDP will be a considerable support to the development of rural tourism over the coming years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Combating poverty and building an inclusive society are key priorities for the Government. The overall goal of the <i>National Action Plan for Social Inclusion,</i> published in 2007, is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty in the population to between 2% and 4% by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. The plan prioritises 12 high level goals in relation to children, people of working age, older people, people with disabilities and communities. It identifies some 150 actions across Departments and agencies with a remit in social policy, as part of a strategic approach to make a decisive impact on poverty over the period to 2016. </P>
        <P>CSO data from the annual<i> Survey on Income and Living Conditions </i>(SILC)<i> </i>shows that in 2008 the consistent poverty rate was 4.2%, having fallen from 5.1% in 2007 and 8.2% in 2003.</P>
        <P>The report on the implementation of the National Action Plan to the end of 2008 shows a similar pattern of progress in the actions of Departments to achieve the goals in the plan.  This involved significant State investment in education, employment and training for lone parents and for people with disabilities; in health and community care for older people; in local and community development; and in integration initiatives for migrants.</P>
        <P>The CSO figures for 2009, published on 25 November last, highlight the continuing importance of social transfers as a stabiliser for people in difficult economic circumstances. In 2009, social transfers reduced the &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate from 46% to 14.1%. This is a &lsquo;poverty reduction effect&rsquo; of 70%.</P>
        <P>The rise in consistent poverty to 5.5% indicated in the 2009 figures is a cause for concern and reflects the increase in unemployment. In meeting the challenges that face us in the immediate years ahead, the Government is committed to prioritising those who are the most vulnerable and to protect as far as possible the frontline services in marginalised communities. The overriding objective now is to restore economic growth and maximise employment so that the recent progress made in tackling poverty can be continued and the goals in the National Action Plan for an inclusive and fair society can be achieved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs was established in March 2010. When announcing the decision to assign new responsibilities to the Department, the Taoiseach stressed the importance of social development and highlighted the continued importance of supporting the most vulnerable members of society and those working to make a difference right across our communities</P><Col N="122"/>
        <P>Against this background, my Department operates and manages a range of schemes and programmes, which support the development of communities, urban and rural, and which tackle disadvantage and promote a fairer, tolerant and more caring society.</P>
        <P>A key programme in this regard is the Local and Community Development Programme, which was launched in 2010, and under which funding of &euro;63.5m will be provided in 2011 to communities across the country to tackle local issues, promote community development and encourage a more caring society.</P>
        <P>My Department also operates schemes and measures which directly promote the equality and human rights agenda and which my colleague, Ms. Mary White, TD, Minister of State for Equality, Human Rights and Integration, has responsibility for. Details of all the schemes and programmes operated by my Department can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.pobail.ie  .</P>
        <P>In relation to new plans and initiatives to promote a fair tolerant and caring society, I can advise the Deputy that Minister of State White has initiated a review of the legislation, structures and arrangements involving the Equality Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the Irish Human Rights Commission in order to enhance equality structures in an effective way. A scoping exercise to identify issues to be addressed in the review is underway.</P>
        <P>In the context of the development of a fair and caring society for women, my Department continues to oversee the implementation of the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy, of which a triennial review is currently under way. Following completion of the review, it may be necessary to bring new proposals to Government to take account of changing priorities, including the requirements of Europe 2020.</P>
        <P>The content of the all encompassing Strategy has been informed by the UN-Beijing Platform for Action to address gender discrimination and by a range of policy recommendations from the EU and the Council of Europe.</P>
        <P>In addition, under the European Social Fund-supported Human Capital Investment Operational Programme, a new Equality for Women Measure, promoting equality of opportunity for women, was launched earlier this year. The total amount of funding identified for the Measure over the period 2008-2014 is approximately &euro;11.5m and projects being currently funded under this Measure assist disadvantaged women preparing for training, education or employment; develop female entrepreneurship or support initiatives which help women advance their careers within employment.</P>
        <P>My Department also has responsibility for promoting and co-coordinating the integration of legally resident immigrants into Irish society. In this regard, I might mention the Ministerial Council on Migrant Integration, which was recently established by Minister of State White and which consists of 74 immigrants from throughout the State who will advise on issues facing them.</P>
        <P>Finally, as the Deputy will know, Mr. John Moloney, TD, Minister of State with responsibility for Disability and Mental Health, continues to work to support and create a fairer society for people with disabilities. In this regard, considerable work has been undertaken on the drafting of a National Disability Strategy Recession Plan, which I envisage will be finalised shortly.</P>

        <Quest> the total budget by his Department, for each of the past three years, for the Traveller <Col N="123"/>policy division; if all funding was drawn down in each year; the headings under which it was drawn down; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the Traveller Policy Division became part of my Department in June 2010. Prior to this, the Division formed part of the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Funding for the Traveller Policy Division forms part of the Equality Monitoring/Consultative Committees subhead. The portion of this subhead allocated to the Traveller Policy Division for the past three years is as follows:</P>
        <P> 2008 &mdash; &euro;1.010m;</P>
        <P> 2009 &mdash; &euro;826,000;</P>
        <P> 2010 &mdash; &euro;417,600.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Of this funding, &euro;860,000 was drawn down in 2008 and &euro;763,000 was drawn down in 2009. The Deputy will appreciate that I am not yet in a position to give a final figure for 2010. However, I am informed by officials in my Department that it is expected that the majority of the funds allocated will be drawn down this year.</P>
        <P>In addition, an allocation of &euro;1.4m in dormant accounts funding was approved for Traveller projects, to be drawn down over the period 2009/2010. Of this allocation, a balance of &euro;496,044 remains to be drawn down.</P>
        <P>I am informed that the savings I have outlined were primarily as a result of slower than anticipated drawdown of funds for local projects administered by Pobal and also a reduction of 8% in Pobal administration fees.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s Traveller Policy Division is responsible for coordinating policy in relation to Travellers. Funding from this Division is used principally to support interagency working through the City and County Development Boards and the work of the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee. Funding support for local projects is administered by Pobal through the Traveller Interagency Fund.</P>
        <P>The Traveller Policy Division also funds mediation and related initiatives, especially in the light of certain serious situations which have arisen around the country in recent years. Funding is also provided for positive communications measures such as Traveller Pride Week, in line with a commitment in <i>Towards 2016</i> from all of the social partners to give &ldquo;concentrated attention&rdquo; to achieving progress on Traveller issues, including &ldquo;...measures to improve communication between Travellers and the general population&rdquo;.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the basis on which he proposes to have administrative efficiencies in his Department leading to savings of &euro;10 million in 2011 and &euro;18 million in a full year; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the savings outlined in section B.17 of the Summary of 2011 Budget Measures. The basis for these efficiencies is set out in greater detail in the recently published National Recovery Plan 2011-2014. For the Deputy&rsquo;s convenience, I have reproduced the relevant table from the plan below.</P>
        <P>As can be seen from the table, the achievement of the necessary savings is a matter that extends broadly across my Department&rsquo;s Vote. To the maximum extent possible, the savings <Col N="124"/>will include efficiencies, which will be sought not only in my Department itself, but also within the agencies and groups that it funds.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 62, 352 to 357, inclusive, and 361 together.  </P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department operates and administers a range of schemes and programmes that support the social and economic development of rural and urban communities across the country. Details of these schemes, including funding available to assist community groups involved in local employment generating and economic revival projects can be accessed at my Department&rsquo;s website at www.pobail.ie</P>
        <P>Key measures that my Department will promote in 2011 to support and encourage community-based effort throughout the country in the current economic situation and to utilise community effort to generate economic revival include the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Local and Community Development Programme, under which a total of &euro;63.5m will be made available in 2011, will assist communities to tackle poverty and social exclusion and encourage local employment opportunities through partnership and constructive engagement between Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities nationally, in both urban and rural settings.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP), with funding of &euro;425m available for the delivery of LEADER-type activities, will continue to be critical to rural communities during the current difficult economic times and will be key to achieving sustainable economic growth and stability in rural regions. To date, the RDP has leveraged <Col N="126"/>private/community funding of approximately &euro;43 million which also aids in the development of strong rural communities as well as economically viable business activity, all of which contributes to the creation of the right conditions for the generation of sustainable, long-term job opportunities.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In Gaeltacht areas, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which,  over the two year period 2009-2010, has been provided with some &euro;70m in Exchequer funding, will continue to play a major role in supporting local enterprise through the range of supports it provides to existing and start-up businesses and to local community initiatives.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In terms of promoting rural tourism, my Departments provides supports not only through the tourism measure of the RDP, but directly through the work of Comhairle na Tuaithe, the implementation of my Department&rsquo;s Walks Scheme and other rural recreation initiatives. My Department also provides support for the Irish Summer Colleges, which in 2010 catered for over 24,000 students attending courses in the Gaeltacht while being accommodated in over 600 households throughout the region, and are central to the promotion of rural cultural tourism in the Gaeltacht. Waterways Ireland, which is co-sponsored by my Department, is also engaged in the promotion and development of rural tourism within the context of its mandate in relation to the development of our inland waterways, which are a valuable and precious tourism resource.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In the current economic circumstances, we are faced with difficult decisions. The Government has considered a number of measures in the context of the National Recovery Plan 2011-14 and Budget 2011 to provide the basis for a sustainable approach to the current financial situation.  Across Government, our approach has been to do this in as balanced a way as possible.</P>
        <P>However, as the Deputy will be aware, allocations to most subheads in my Department&rsquo;s Vote have been reduced by varying amounts in the Budget, as is the case in all Departments.  Within this context, my primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the daily front-line services which are being provided with funding from my Department are protected, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities. In the prevailing financial circumstances, it is clear that objectives will have to be pursued with less resources than previously. However, we will continue to strive to achieve good outcomes and value for money, notwithstanding these constraints. In the case of a number of my Department&rsquo;s capital programmes, such as CL&Aacute;R, the focus in 2011 will be on meeting existing commitments, rather than initiating new measures or projects.</P>
        <P>Clearly, the changed circumstances in which we live today require a sharpening of focus for us all in terms of addressing the nature of the problems which now present themselves. In response to this changing context, working more closely with communities and providing focused and effective supports at local level will be key objectives for my Department in the coming period.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of future legislative proposals, the main proposals envisaged at present are:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A Bill to amend the Dormant Accounts legislation for the purpose of improving the administrative efficiency of the existing operations of the Dormant Accounts Fund. It is anticipated that this Bill will be published shortly.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Arising from the 20-year Strategy for the Irish Language, legislation will be brought forward in 2011 to establish an Irish Language and Gaeltacht Authority with responsi<Col N="127"/>bility for Irish language matters throughout the State. The new Authority will assume responsibility, inter alia, for relevant functions currently performed by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, including an enterprise function.</P>

	<P>Funding of the order of &euro;16.249m will be made available to support measures relating to equality and diversity during 2011.  Among the key priorities for my Department will be the continuation of the vital work done by equality and human rights agencies, and the support of important integration and diversity management initiatives throughout the country. While some reductions are necessary, I expect that much of the required savings can be achieved through efficiencies in administration and overhead costs.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s equality and rights agencies have been given adequate funding to continue their core work next year. The Equality Tribunal has been given a 9% increase. The allocations for the Equality Authority and Irish Human Rights Commission will allow them to continue promoting and researching issues of equality and human rights.</P>
        <P>Supports for women have been protected, with full funding for the Equality for Women measure being maintained. This funding stream helps women throughout the country to access new opportunities for employment, training and enterprise, which is vital at this difficult economic time. The national women&rsquo;s organisations will receive combined funding of over &euro;500,000 next year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Funding of initiatives to support the Traveller Community has been reduced by 4% on the 2010 allocation. However, it is expected that this reduction can be met from administrative savings. My Department will continue to support interagency working through the City and County Development Boards and the work of the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee. I also envisage continued funds for mediation and related initiatives, especially in the light of serious situations which have arisen around the country in recent years. Funding will also be provided for positive communications measures such as Traveller Pride Week, in line with a commitment in Towards 2016 from all of the social partners to give &lsquo;concentrated attention&rsquo; to achieving progress on Traveller issues, including &lsquo;...measures to improve communication between Travellers and the general population&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>A combined allocation of &euro;5.8m for the Office of the Minister for Integration and the European Refugee Fund will facilitate the continuation of measures to promote the integration of legally resident immigrants (including the Ministerial Council on Migrant Integration and grants to local authorities, sporting bodies, etc), as well as the funding of projects under the European Refugee Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals. In fact, the provision in these subheads is very close to the likely outturn in 2010.</P>
        <P>A further priority will be the advancement of the implementation of the National Disability Strategy, with a provision of &euro;7.499m made for this sector in 2011.</P>

	<P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No 91 on 3 Samhain 2010, the establishment of the Ministerial Council on Integration is one of the initiatives outlined in the policy statement &mdash; <i>Migration Nation: Statement on Integration Strategy and Diversity Management</i>   &mdash; and is part of progressing work on immigrant integration policy in Ireland. The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, Children and Integration and the Senior Officials Group which supports the Cabinet Committee are also involved in this work. </P>
        <P>The Council provides a forum where immigrants can speak directly to me regarding their experience of integration in Ireland and assist me in better-informed policymaking by identifying issues and bringing them to attention. Inaugural meetings of the Ministerial Council on Integration have been held in all the regional fora of the Council. Following the completion of the inaugural meetings of the Ministerial Council, it is my intention to convene a formal meeting of the standing Cross-Departmental Group on Integration in the near future.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the policy of mainstreaming of services for migrants, primary responsibility for the delivery of services rests with the relevant service providers and Government agencies at both central and local level. My Office engages with these bodies (and with relevant non-governmental organisations) on an ongoing basis with regard to issues relating to the integration of migrants. Issues which have been raised at the Ministerial Council are brought to the attention of the appropriate bodies.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 59 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, further to a Government decision in late 2008, my Department commenced a review of the Caighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il (Official Standard) for Irish earlier this year. It could be said that organic development is at the heart of this process. The Caighde&aacute;n has not been reviewed or updated since it was first published in 1958. In linguistic terms, it is inevitable that there will always be a gap between any spoken language and the official written standard for any language. However, it is widely accepted that this gap is now excessive with regard to the Irish language, since the spoken language has continued to develop over the last 50 years.</P>
        <P>I appointed a Steering Committee to oversee the Review of the Caighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il, which is due to be completed in June of next year. The Department of Education and Skills has a representative on the Committee and its involvement in the process is crucial.  Education is one of the areas where the new Caighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il will have most impact. What is clear from <Col N="129"/>submissions received during the public consultations is that, above all else, people want clarity on rules in the Caighde&aacute;n. This may involve simplification in some instances, but simplicity was one of the criteria adopted by those who published the Caighde&aacute;n in 1958. As I stated at the outset of this Review, some rules will go, some rules will be amended, and completely new rules may be put in place. However in all cases, the criteria underpinning these decisions will epitomise the concept of organic development &mdash; clarity, internal consistency, simplicity and due regard to the spoken language in the Gaeltacht. Taken together, these show that organic development is a progressive yet complex process. It is my hope as Minister that the final result in this review process will highlight the best traits of such organic development, while also providing the clarity that people are looking for.</P>
        <P>My proposals in relation to the development of the language at community level within the Gaeltacht and throughout the State will be set out in the 20-year Strategy for the Irish Language, which will be published shortly, and in respect of which there are separate Questions to me on today&rsquo;s Order Paper.</P>

	<P>My Department is represented on the Inter-Agency Group on Severe Weather and is presently working with other Government Departments and agencies to assist and support communities across the country, including the elderly and vulnerable, and those living alone and in rural areas, during the current difficult weather conditions.  As Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, I have written to the range of community groups and bodies with which my Department has an ongoing relationship to highlight the need for their members to continue to keep in regular contact with people who may find themselves housebound and living alone during the current inclement weather conditions, in order to ensure that such people have sufficient supplies of food and heat over the coming days and weeks.

        <P>The Deputy may also be aware that Muintir na T&iacute;re, which is supported by my Department and the Department of Justice and Law Reform, has established a special helpline for older and vulnerable people that may be trapped in their homes due to the cold weather conditions and I know this helpline has been accessed by many over the last number of days.</P>
        <P>I would like to acknowledge the very important and invaluable assistance being offered to communities across the country by the community and voluntary sector during the current inclement weather conditions.

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP) represents a substantial investment in rural areas and has a significant role to play in sustaining and creating rural employment.  The main objectives of the RDP are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy. Axes 3 &amp; 4 (LEADER) of the RDP, for which my Department has responsibility, continue to facilitate access to significant financial resources for rural communities. Enterprise support has always been a significant element of successive programmes facilitating rural development in Ireland, including the current and previous LEADER elements of such programmes.</P>
        <P>I believe that the enterprise funding available under the RDP adds value to other supports available by specifically targeting rural areas and by seeking to reinforce the economic impact of similar and related interventions under other Axes of the RDP and, indeed, other national programmes.</P><Col N="131"/>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that I work closely with my Cabinet colleagues, particularly the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Mr Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, T.D., to promote increased co-operation between groups implementing LEADER and other agencies either directly or indirectly involved in supporting enterprise &mdash; specifically the County Enterprise Boards. Our aim is to ensure that we maximise the impact of all of the funding available and support enterprise and job creation in rural areas to the greatest extent possible, while at the same time ensuring that no unnecessary or inefficient overlaps or duplication occur.</P>
        <P>The individual measures under the RDP that specifically support enterprise creation and development, including their indicative allocations, are as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Diversification into non-agricultural activities for farm families &mdash;   &euro;16.66m;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Support for business creation and development &mdash; &euro;48.26m; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Encouragement of tourism activities &mdash; &euro;45.4m.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">To date the RDP has leveraged private/community funding of approximately &euro;43 million which also aids in the development of strong rural communities as well as economically viable business activity, all of which contributes to the creation of the right conditions for the generation of sustainable, long term job opportunities.</P>
        <P>In Gaeltacht areas, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta plays a major role in supporting local enterprise through the range of supports it provides to existing and start-up enterprises.  Over the two year period 2009-2010, An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s has been provided with some &euro;70m in Exchequer funding to allow it to pursue these objectives. In addition to Exchequer-voted funding, An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s also has access to other sources of income that enable it to promote and stimulate employment creating initiatives &mdash; for example, income generated from schemes such as the Community Employment Scheme and the Rural Social Scheme, income from dividends, fees and the sale/lease of assets, and employment support schemes operated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 68 together.</P>
        <P>I have not made any public appointments since 22 November, 2010.</P>
        <P>Preparations for the appointment of a new<b> </b>  Public Service Board, to be chaired by Minister of State Dara Calleary, are continuing.  With a majority of members from outside the Public Service, it will advise the Government on further opportunities and priorities for transformation and efficiency, and on the capacity of the Public Service to lead change and to deliver a high standard of performance.  This will inform the approach of the Government and Public Service management to the transformation process over the period ahead.</P>
        <P>Following the dissolution of two of the constituent bodies under the National Economic and Social Development Office (the NCPP and the NESF), it was decided that the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) should be reconstituted in a manner which takes into account the changes to the overall structure of Social Partnership, in particular the inclusion of the Environmental Pillar. It was also decided to increase the number of independent members to provide greater external input to the work of the Council.  These changes coincided with the conclusion of the term of the Council in Summer 2010.</P>
        <P>Last week, a motion of approval of the National Economic and Social Council (Alteration of Composition) Order 2010 was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, facilitating these changes.  Consequently, I expect to appoint new members of the Council shortly.  The majority of the membership is appointed on the basis of nominations received from social partner organisations.</P>
        <P>Other than in these areas, I am not due to make any public appointments between 14 December 2010 and 28 February 2011 at present.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.</P>
        <P>Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including projects for Waterford, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>However, for the Deputy&rsquo;s convenience, I am setting out below the relevant extracts from my Department&rsquo;s website for Waterford City and County for both primary and post primary schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All applications for major capital projects are assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band rating.  The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of each individual project at this time.</P>

        <P>However, Bus &Eacute;ireann which operates the School Transport Scheme, on behalf of my Department, has advised that the family can now avail of a school transport service to and from school.</P>
        <P>As a rule primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 2.4 kilometres to travel to a pick-up point. Parents/guardians have a responsibility to ensure that their children are brought safely to and collected safely from designated pick up and set down points. Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the family referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied live within 2.2 kilometres from a pick up point and that this pick up point is considered to be as safe as other designated pick-up points being used throughout the country.</P>
        <P>As the family has a level of service within guidelines, it is not proposed to alter the current arrangements.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</P>
        <P>FETAC have informed my Department that the decision to offer early retirement to staff in late 2008 was influenced by a number of factors.  The reduction of numbers at certain grades was in line with the recommendations of an organisational review of FETAC undertaken by Farrell Grant Sparks.  This review was in turn arranged in response to a recommendation in the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland external review of FETAC that identified structural imbalance in the organisation.  FETAC also cited the expectation that efficiencies would arise from the forthcoming amalgamation of HETAC, FETAC and NQAI and that salary savings would be achieved over time arising from the early retirements.</P><Col N="141"/>
        <P>I understand that three of the four former members of staff held the position of Development Officer, a senior technical grade in FETAC.  The fourth member of staff held a Grade VI post, an administrative middle management position.  A table showing the length of service and lump sum paid to each of the members of staff is set out below.</P>
        <P>The Senior Management Team of FETAC, led by the Chief Executive Officer, authorised the early retirements.  The approval of the Minister for Education and Skills and the consent of the Minister for Finance, required by FETAC&rsquo;s governing legislation, was not sought. Legal advice in respect of the recovery or reassessment of unauthorised benefits has been obtained and is being considered.</P>
        <P>Apart from the FETAC early retirement scheme, no other staff have left FETAC, HETAC or the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland since the amalgamation announcement, other than through resignation, non-renewal of temporary contracts due to the moratorium on public sector recruitment, the expiry of a period of secondment from another organisation or normal retirement pursuant to the terms of the relevant pension scheme.</P>

	<P>The Work Placement Programme is intended to assist people who are unemployed to develop their skills levels to secure work experience that will assist them in finding employment. My Department recently issued circular 66/2010 which permits schools to participate in the Work Placement Programme if they so wish. </P>
        <P>The programme provides a mechanism for schools to offer placements to graduates and non-graduates from a wide variety of disciplines and provides an opportunity for schools to access skills and experience which may otherwise be unavailable. The individuals on placement will, in turn, have the opportunity to utilise and develop their own skills.</P>
        <P>This involves a placement for a defined period, rather than employment, and participants in this voluntary programme may be entitled to maintain their social welfare entitlements subject to the rules of the Department of Social Protection.</P>
        <P>Schools may offer placements to teachers registered with the Teaching Council.  Where a registered teacher is engaged he or she may undertake normal teaching duties if the school authority considers this appropriate and can make suitable arrangements.   Schools may also use the programme to engage people in non-teaching roles, where non-teaching graduates and non-graduates may have valuable skills from which a school could benefit.  It is a condition of the programme that any placements must not displace an existing member of staff or be used to fill a vacant post. This includes substitute vacancies. These conditions safeguard future employment opportunities in the education sector.</P><Col N="142"/>
        <P>In addition, the Government has also decided to expand the number of placements offered under the Work Placement Programme. The number of places on the programme will be increased from the current 2,000 to 7,500 in 2011, with 5,000 of the additional placements being offered in the public sector.</P>

	<P>The school referred to by the Deputy was announced earlier this year for the appointment of a design team. Representatives from the Board of Management of this school attended a briefing given by my Department to explain the tendering process and the steps involved.</P>
        <P>The first stage of this process, which was carried out by my Department on behalf of the school, has been completed and pre-qualified lists of consultants have issued to the Board of Management. The next step will be for the Board of Management to issue invitations to the pre-qualified consultants to tender for the selection and appointment of the design team.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2004, agreement was reached to amalgamate the two primary schools referred to by the Deputy. The application for capital funding to facilitate this amalgamation was assessed and assigned a band rating of 1.4. </P>
        <P>A technical inspection was carried out on the existing school buildings to determine which would be suitable to facilitate the amalgamated school. The report produced following this inspection concluded that the most suitable building to facilitate the amalgamation would be the girls&rsquo; school. It also found that an additional portion of land would be required from the Sisters of Mercy to facilitate the development. The Department has received an offer of lands from the Sisters of Mercy under the Residential Institutions Redress compensation scheme. The Department is considering this offer in the context of the religious orders&rsquo; response to the Government request for an increase in their contribution under the Redress scheme.</P>
        <P>On conclusion of the acquisition of the site, the progression of the amalgamated school building project will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

	<P>The process of assessing and paying third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the timing of payment varies between the 66 awarding authorities depending on a number of variables including the volume of applications received, staffing resources and whether or not properly completed application forms have been submitted. Work prioritisation across different functions, and how available staff are deployed to execute those functions are matters for the management of each VEC and local authority concerned.</P>
        <P>This year&rsquo;s student grant schemes include a number of significant administrative and service improvements aimed at addressing the issue of delay, which include an initial roll-out of a new online grant application system. The new system, introduced in both Irish and English, is already operating in 11 grant awarding authorities. Building on this initial phase for the current academic year, the ultimate aim will be to make it available to all applicants nationally.</P>
        <P>Key among the other improvements introduced are a complete overhaul of the grant application form, streamlined administrative processes, advance payments to awarding authorities and publication of the grant schemes some two months earlier than last year.  The Student Support Bill, which will provide for a fundamental and radical restructuring of the whole student grants administration function and provide for a single unified scheme is now listed to be taken at Report stage on 16 December 2010.</P>
        <P>The table below details the number of new student grant applications received, awarded, refused, on-going, cancelled, yet to be processed, transferred and the number paid by the local authorities and Vocational Educational Committees for the 2010/11 academic year up to the week ended 3 December 2010 unless otherwise stated. The information has been supplied to my Department by the local authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.</P>
        <P>My Department is in constant contact with grant awarding authorities to monitor the situation in relation to the processing and payment of student grants, particularly as a number of grant awarding authorities have not supplied up to date information in this matter.  It recently wrote, on my behalf, to the heads of the grant awarding authorities to inform them that I am anxious to ensure that remaining applicants receive decisions on their grant applications as soon as possible and requesting their co-operation in prioritising this work in their Councils/Committees.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has recently issued a circular which permits schools to participate in the F&Aacute;S Work Placement Programme (WPP) if they so wish.  This F&Aacute;S programme is intended to assist people who are unemployed to retain their skills levels and secure work experience that will assist them in finding employment.  This involves a placement for a defined period, rather than employment, and participants in this voluntary programme may be entitled to maintain their social welfare entitlements subject to the rules of the Department of Social Protection.</P>
        <P>The WPP provides a mechanism for schools to offer placements to graduates and non-graduates from a wide variety of disciplines which has not existed up until now and offers an opportunity for schools to access skills and experience which may otherwise be unavailable.  The individuals on placement will, in turn, have the opportunity to utilise and develop their own skills.</P>
        <P>Placements are not confined to teaching or SNA posts.  It is a condition of the programme that any placements must not displace an existing member of staff or be used to fill a vacant post.  This provision includes substitute vacancies.  People interested in applying for placements under the scheme should contact their nearest F&Aacute;S office as all placements will be advertised through F&Aacute;S.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 85 together.</P>
        <P>I assume the Deputy is concerned with appointments to State Boards that come under the aegis of my Department.  Since the 22nd, November 2010 to date I have made 6 appointments to Boards which are contained in the tabular statement below. They are new appointments with the exception of Mr. Scott at Tipperary Rural &amp; Business Development Institute (T.R.B.D.I.) who is a re-appointment. The appointees listed do not receive any remuneration for carrying out their functions. They are entitled to claim travel and subsistence expenses that arise in carrying out their duties.</P>
        <P>I am aware that eight vacancies will arise on the National Qualification Authority on the 25th, February 2011. There are also eight vacancies on the Higher Education Authority and fifteen on the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering &amp; Technology.</P>
        <P>I have requested officials at my Department to compile a full list of vacancies on bodies under the aegis of my Department and I will forward it to the Deputy when it is available.</P>

	<P>My Department has reached agreement, in principle, subject to contract with Cork County Council and is in on-going liaison with the Local Authority in relation to the proposed acquisition of a site. Due to the commercial sensitivities relating to site acquisitions, I am not in a position to comment further at this time. Once this acquisition is concluded, the proposed building project will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to my Department for school buildings generally.</P>

	<P>Pension arrangements for primary, secondary, community and comprehensive teachers are governed by statutory superannuation provisions. Under these provisions admission to the pension schemes is mandatory for teachers, including permanent, temporary, part-time and substitute teachers, appointed to approved teaching positions in schools who are paid salary, out of monies voted by the Oireachtas, through the Payroll operated by my Department. A number of part-time teachers who are employed by management authorities and paid by grant to the school, will from January 2011 be paid through my Department&rsquo;s payroll and will contribute to the pension scheme from then. Provision is being made to enable these teachers to reckon past part-time service for pension purposes subject to the usual terms and conditions including the payment of appropriate contributions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Apart from the circumstances outlined above, where part-time teachers are paid by grant to the school, it is a matter for the management authority of the employing school to make provision for access to a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) for such personnel. The management authority is not required to contribute to a PRSA.</P>

	<P>My Department issued a circular to all school authorities in late 2005 urging trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available, where possible, for community education and recreation purposes. </P>
        <P>It appears that the school in question is making some of its school facilities available for the running of F&Aacute;S courses.</P>
        <P>Decisions in relation to the use of school facilities are at the discretion of the school authorities, subject to the condition that the needs of the students attending the school are prioritised in the first instance. School authorities must always be cognisant of their responsibility to provide a duty of care towards the pupils in the school.  It is therefore essential that the Board has appropriate measures in place to safeguard the welfare and safety of its pupils.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to vetting, the current arrangements for vetting of teaching and non-teaching staff are set out in Department Circular 0094/2006 which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. My Department has also recently issued a new circular (0063/2010) which updates and expands the Garda vetting requirements for all primary and post-primary schools.  The requirements of this circular are effective from 1 January 2011.</P>

	<P>The total additional revenue that will be generated by Higher Education institutions by replacing the existing &euro;1,500 per year Student Services Charge with a flat Higher Education Student Contribution of &euro;2,000 with effect from the 2011/2012 academic year is estimated to amount to some &euro;55 million. Of the additional &euro;55m, the contribution that will be paid by the Exchequer in respect of students who qualify under the third level grant schemes will amount to some &euro;28m.  The new Student <Col N="157"/>Contribution will apply to all students who currently benefit under the &rsquo;free fees&rsquo; scheme.  In addition, higher education institutions will be asked to put in place arrangements under which a student may opt to pay the contribution in two equal instalments of 50% in September and 50% in January in a given academic year.</P>
        <P>The overall net additional revenue will be reduced by virtue of the commitment to increase the current higher education grants schemes threshold to provide for an additional eligibility category of support qualifying for &rsquo;50% Student Contribution&rsquo; and the arrangements to provide that second and subsequent siblings from a single family will not have to bear the full increased cost of the new &euro;2,000 contribution. Whilst it is not possible to provide a precise calculation, it is estimated that the reduction in additional revenue may amount to some &euro;8 million.</P>
        <P>In relation to the introduction of a new &euro;200 annual contribution for Post Leaving Certificate students, it is estimated that the total additional revenue that will be generated will amount to some &euro;7.5 million and by up to &euro;4 million net when payments by the Exchequer on behalf of those students who are eligible under the student grant schemes are taken into account.  Eligible PLC students may include those in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance provided that they meet all of the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme.</P>

	<P>My Department recently issued circular 66/2010 which permits schools to participate in the Work Placement Programme if they so wish.  The Work Placement Programme is intended to assist people who are unemployed to develop their skills levels and secure work experience that will assist them in finding employment. The programme provides a mechanism for schools to offer placements to graduates and non-graduates from a wide variety of disciplines and provides an opportunity for schools to access skills and experience which may otherwise be unavailable. <Col N="158"/>The individuals on placement will, in turn, have the opportunity to utilise and develop their own skills.  This involves a placement for a defined period, rather than employment, and participants in this voluntary programme may be entitled to maintain their social welfare entitlements subject to the rules of the Department of Social Protection.</P>
        <P>Schools may offer placements to teachers registered with the Teaching Council.  Where a registered teacher is engaged he or she may undertake normal teaching duties if the school authority considers this appropriate and can make suitable arrangements.  Schools may also use the programme to engage people in non-teaching roles, where non-teaching graduates and non-graduates may have valuable skills from which a school could benefit.  It is a condition of the programme that any placements must not displace an existing member of staff or be used to fill a vacant post.  This includes substitute vacancies.  These conditions safeguard future employment opportunities in the education sector.  In addition, the Government has also decided to expand the number of placements offered under the Work Placement Programme.  The number of places on the programme will be increased from the current 2,000 to 7,500 in 2011, with 5,000 of the additional placements being offered in the public sector</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of the car parking levy has been the subject of a considerable degree of work undertaken by officials in my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The necessary preparatory work has now been completed and I am currently considering a date for the commencement of the levy.  An employee will be liable to the levy where he or she has an entitlement to use a parking space for the parking of a vehicle covered by the levy, the parking space is provided directly or indirectly by the employer, and the parking space is located in an area designated by the Minister for Finance, initially within Dublin city. This will be extended to other urban areas at a later date. The levy is &euro;200 per annum, in general.</P>
        <P>A reduced levy applies where car parking spaces are shared between employees provided that the ratio of employees to each car parking space is 2:1 or more. In these circumstances, the levy for employees with an entitlement to park will be reduced to &euro;100. Where an employee&rsquo;s normal pattern of work is on the basis of part-time or job-sharing arrangements, then the levy amount payable is reduced pro-rata, but not below a minimum of 50 per cent of the amount otherwise due. A reduction in the levy can also apply in the case of shift workers.  There are exemptions for disabled persons, employees of the emergency services, and for occasional use of a parking space, including by retired employees.</P>
        <P>The scheme will require the employer to deduct the levy from the employee through the payroll system and return the levy to Revenue. Deductions of the levy will be spread throughout the year in line with the frequency of salary payments. The Revenue Commissioners have published a guidance document covering implementation of the levy, this is available <i>on www.revenue.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The tax exemption for patent income has been in place for over 30 years and has applied to income received by an individual or company from a qualifying patent subject, since 2008, to an annual limit of &euro;5 million. A tax exemption has also applied, subject to certain conditions, to distributions paid by companies from exempt patent income. These exemptions have been abolished with effect from 24 November 2010.  The decision to abolish the relief was taken in the light of a recommendation to this effect by the Commission on Taxation. As part of its review of all tax expenditures, the Commission on Taxation examined the relief for patent income to determine if its continued operation was justified on cost benefit grounds. The Commission found that the relief has not had the desired impact on innovation and R&amp;D activity and that, despite various refinements to the scheme over the years, it was not a particularly well-targeted measure providing good value for money. </P>
        <P>The Government agrees with the conclusions of the Commission and believes that in the current challenging times scarce resources should be focussed instead on the R&amp;D tax credit scheme. The R&amp;D credit scheme provides a more direct and effective incentive for enterprises to innovate and invest in R&amp;D activities and the scheme has been enhanced considerably in recent years to make it one of the most competitive of its kind anywhere.</P>
        <P>Abolition of the patent income exemption will yield &euro;50 million to the Exchequer in a full year and this is provided for in the National Recovery Plan. Alternative options for curtailing the relief were considered in the context of the Plan, such as limiting the tax free payment to a fixed amount per annum. While a limit of &euro;40,000, as suggested in the proposal referred to in the question, would provide some savings, it would still mean a significant cost to the Exchequer and would be difficult to justify on the basis that it would provide tax-efficient means for remunerating employees.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that Section 45 of Finance Act 2008 introduced new tax provisions in relation to profits derived from petroleum exploration and production activities. A new tax called a &ldquo;profit resource rent tax&rdquo; will apply at rates of 5%, 10% or 15% in addition to the corporation tax rate of 25% that currently applies to profits from petroleum activities.  It will apply when profits exceed certain defined levels.  This will be worked out by a formula that relates the profits from a petroleum field to the capital investment in the field. The new tax provisions give effect to the Government Decision of 30 July 2007 that a new regime would apply in relation to petroleum profits from discoveries made from 2007 onwards.  I have no plans to introduce a levy along the lines proposed by the Deputy.</P>

Building on progress already made, the purpose of the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 is to plot a course to sound, sustainable growth for the economy. Budget 2011 represents the first instalment of that Plan.  The approach being taken by the Government in the Plan and in Budget 2011 will help to dispel uncertainty and will give consumers and businesses confidence to spend in the economy. </P>
        <P>The Government is satisfied that this is the most sustainable approach to support an acceleration of growth in the economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not accept that reliance on false assumptions about income, long term economic productivity and consumer behaviour were the sole reasons for the difficulties faced by the banking sector although they could all be classed as playing their part. Other factors included loan impairments, particularly in the property sector, falling asset prices, bank lending policies and bank remuneration policies.   The Irish Government took a number of decisive steps to stabilise and maintain the banking sector including the introduction of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008, the initial recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee scheme, NAMA the investments in Anglo, Irish Nationwide and EBS and most recently the joint EU-IMF Programme for Ireland which includes a facility of up to &euro;35 billion to support the banking sector. </P>
        <P>I would not accept that these actions should be categorised as transferring the credit institutions&rsquo; liabilities onto the State and I want to make it clear that debt clemency arrangements would further increase the exposure of the State. In relation to debt clemency for NAMA <Col N="163"/>debtors, the NAMA Board has stated clearly in its Business Plan that it will enforce personal guarantees to the greatest extent feasible.</P>

	<P>The majority of the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s (IMF) financial resources are generated by the subscriptions of member states.  Each member is assigned a quota, broadly based on its size relative to the world economy.  A member&rsquo;s quota determines its maximum financial commitment to the IMF, its voting power, and has a bearing on its access to IMF financing. Quotas are denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs*), the IMF&rsquo;s unit of account.  A member must pay its subscription in full upon joining the Fund: up to 25 percent must be paid in SDRs or widely accepted currencies (such as the U.S. dollar, the euro, the yen, or the pound sterling), while the rest is paid in the member&rsquo;s own currency (in Ireland&rsquo;s case this is the euro).</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s current IMF quota is SDR 838.4 million or 0.38%.  Our quota level has been at this level for the years 2005-2010.  A quarter of this is paid in SDRs, while the remainder remains a contingent liability on the Central Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet until drawn down by the IMF.  It should be noted that quotas make funds available for use and the IMF can call on members at any time to contribute.  Details of transactions on the Central Bank&rsquo;s IMF accounts are set out in the Annual Report on Ireland&rsquo;s Participation in the IMF and the World Bank (available at www.finance.gov.ie).</P>
        <P>In 2008, a general review of quotas at the IMF took place. Once ratified, Ireland&rsquo;s holding will increase to 0.528% or SDRs 1,257 million.  Furthermore, under the fourteenth review of quotas, the recent G20 Summit in Korea agreed to a set of proposals which will ultimately <Col N="165"/>result in Ireland&rsquo;s quota being increased again to 0.724% or SDR 3,449.9 million.  Ireland&rsquo;s quota level is not affected by the Joint EU/IMF Programme.</P>
        <P>*At 24 November 2010 &euro;1 = SDR 0.86547</P>

	<P>I have no role in assessing or confirming an individual&rsquo;s tax liability or in making payment arrangements.  These are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the person in question is issued with a tax return (Form 12) annually as he is in receipt of owner-occupier relief under the Rural Renewal Scheme. </P>
        <P>This person incorrectly received a refund &euro;4,215.70 on 2 April 2008 for the tax year 2007 because, when his tax return for that year was processed, his spouse&rsquo;s income details (which he had not shown on the return) were inadvertently omitted.  The incorrect 2007 refund came to light this year and, on 18 August 2010, the person in question was informed of the approximate amount of this underpayment in a telephone conversation with the Sligo Revenue Office.  He was also informed of the option of collecting the underpayment over a number of years and it was arranged that he would further contact the Sligo office to arrange a meeting to discuss his tax affairs.</P>
        <P>As the person in question had not contacted the Sligo office to arrange a meeting, a PAYE Balancing Statement (P21) for the year 2007 issued on 23 November 2010, showing a net underpayment of &euro;3,466.91.  The Revenue Commissioners advise me that the option of making the payment over a number of years, previously offered, is still available and the person in question should contact the Sligo office (071 9148614) to make the necessary arrangements.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the Office of the Attorney General advised on all aspects of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill.  The public service pension reduction measure is in accordance with the Croke Park Agreement.  Section 3 provides that the calculation of public service pensions is not affected.  <b>&rdquo;</b>Nothing in <i>section 2</i> shall affect the calculation of any public service pension entitlement (including an entitlement to a lump sum and an entitlement to periodic payments of pension or other benefits) of a person who is a pensioner or becomes a pensioner on or at any time before the relevant date or, in the case of a pensioner falling under paragraph (c) of the definition of &ldquo;pensioner&rdquo; in <i>section 1</i>, at any time after that date.&rdquo;  Implementation of the measure, therefore, does not impact on the calculation of pensions, nor is there any change in the future method of determining pension increases.  Also, in the case of those retiring up to end-February 2012, the measure will be applied to pensions as calculated by reference to the pre 1 January 2010 pay rates. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Stamp Duty reforms as announced in the Budget have two aims: stimulation of the property market and commencing the necessary infrastructure for the commitment in the National Recovery Plan to introduce a Site Value Tax.  As a result of the changes, Stamp Duty at a rate of 1% where the property value is under &euro;1m and 2% on the excess above &euro;1m, will now be payable on all residential property transactions.  I have, however, put in place a transitional arrangement: where a binding contract has <Col N="169"/>been entered into before 8 December 2010, and the effect of this measure would increase the Stamp Duty otherwise chargeable, there will be a transition period whereby Stamp Duty can be calculated and charged under the old regime, so long as the instrument effecting the transfer of the property is executed before 1 July 2011.</P>
        <P>I am aware that there will always be winners and losers in a situation such as this, but unfortunately this will happen no matter what date is chosen to commence any new measure and this is regrettable.  While there may be additional Stamp Duty costs for some purchasers, the overall transaction costs for property transfers are now much lower than in recent years because of the decline in property values.</P>

	<P>The Department of Finance, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and independent consultants carried out major detailed reviews of certain tax incentive schemes in 2005.  A key recommendation of these reviews was that a cost benefit analysis should be carried out on any proposed future scheme prior to their introduction.  A tax incentive scheme for the mid-Shannon region was subsequently proposed and my Department in line with the new policy engaged Goodbody Economic Consultants to carry out an assessment of the costs and benefits of the proposed scheme.  The report was completed in March 2006.  The aim of this scheme is to encourage the provision of tourist infrastructure in the mid-Shannon region. If tourists need accommodation there are already plenty of hotels and B&amp;Bs in the area &mdash; however at present tourists do not stay in the area in the large numbers we would want.  What is needed are tourist related facilities that will encourage people to stay in the area and experience what the mid-Shannon region has to offer.  This scheme aims to promote the provision of such facilities.  It is not anticipated that the restriction of Section 23 relief will impact significantly on the Mid-Shannon Scheme.</P>

	<P>My Department together with the Revenue Commissioners has been engaged in detailed discussions with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the many complex issues associated with the legacy property relief schemes which continue to cost the Exchequer several hundreds of millions of Euro a year in tax forgone.  The measures announced in the Budget are intended to be proportionate but also effective in terms of reducing the burden on the Exchequer.  An impact assessment will be carried out in advance of the 2014 deadline to identify any significant effects of the proposed changes with the aim of providing for such effects in a future Budget in advance of the 2014 guillotine.  I realise that these measures may be severe on some people but the economic situation requires that I explore as many avenues as possible to achieve Exchequer savings.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Department of Social Protection that payments made under the Treatment Benefit Scheme show a drop of 59.8% in 2010 over 2009.  However as dental practice incomes also include private payments and HSE payments it is not possible for that Department to know what the overall reduction in income to dental practices was in 2010.  Approximately 933,000 fewer treatments were paid as part of the Dental Benefit Scheme in 2010, as compared to 2009.  The Department of Social Protection is not in a position to quantify the overall reduction in treatments as they may also be carried out and paid for privately or as I have indicated part of the HSE&rsquo;s parallel dental scheme.  The Government has no specific plans to assist young dentists in debt.</P>
        <P>The decisions financial institutions operating in Ireland make on an application for credit or restructuring of existing credit arrangements is a commercial decision for the institution concerned.  The Department of Finance has no direct function in relation to individual&rsquo;s decisions on these matters.  A general debt forgiveness scheme would have costs not only for the bank, but also for the Government. Banks would require further capital support which in turn would be passed on to the tax payer.  A debt forgiveness policy raises its own issues such as &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; and &ldquo;moral hazard&rdquo; for those who are managing to make their repayments.</P>

In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</P>

	<P>I established the Independent Review Group on Child Deaths (IRGCD)  on March 8th 2010. The Group is composed of Ms Norah Gibbons and Mr. Geoffrey Shannon. </P>
        <P>The HSE have transferred the relevant files to the IRGCD, via my Office.  The HSE originally identified 188 files for transfer to the Independent Review Group on Child Deaths in respect of children who died while in care, children who were known to the child protection services and young people who had been in care as children and died after their 18th birthday.  Following that transfer, and as had been previously indicated, the HSE re-examined all of its records to check whether there were any other outstanding cases which should be passed to the Review Group.  In the course of that examination, the HSE identified a further 11 cases, 9 relating to children known to the services and 2 young adults.  All of the relevant files were passed to the IRGCD in October, and they form part of the work now being carried out by the group.</P>
        <P>The Group has sought certain clarification in relation to information presented to it and the HSE is responding to queries raised. As well as the extra files provided in October, a number of the files presented were the subject of ongoing reviews in the HSE and this delayed the transfer of these files to the Independent Review Group. Taking these factors  into account, <Col N="176"/>coupled with the need for a thorough and complete process and the large amount of case work presented, it is likely that the Group will report to me in February 2011.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that part of the work of the IRGCD is to analyse the categorisation of the deaths being examined and to ensure that the cases placed in each category are correct.</P>

	<P>The findings of the Strategic Review of the Delivery and Management of Children and Family Services,  (known as the PA Consulting Report) are helping to inform the HSE in the restructuring of services at national and regional level. The report is the subject of regular discussion with the HSE, most recently as part of  the preparation of its Service Plan for 2011. </P>
        <P>I expect that the 2011 Service Plan will include a strong and measurable commitment on the part of the HSE to further progress the implementation of the findings of the PA Report. I will be meeting with HSE senior management later this week at which the matter will be the subject of further discussion. I look forward to completion by the HSE of initial testing of the recommendations in selected regions in 2011 and to an expanded roll-out beyond these areas.</P>
        <P>I am unaware of particular industrial relations issues which may serve to impede progress. I recently convened a meeting with IMPACT to discuss a range of issues of mutual concern, including implementation of this report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to progressing the implementation of the specific recommendations contained in the PA Report, the HSE is also in the process of strengthening its capacity to deliver on the necessary changes and reforms required. In this context, I raised in recent months the need for the appointment of an individual at National Director level who has a proven track record to lead the reform of Children and Family Services. The HSE was very receptive to the proposal and to the need for the appointment of a person who would have the authority to deliver on the wide and ambitious reform programme in this area. The post-holder will lead structural, information, and managerial improvements within a clear service model that focuses on best outcomes for families and children. The appointee will have oversight responsibility for ensuring that services are delivered appropriately, safely and of a high quality in line with statutory obligations. This will be the second senior management appointment in this area and it builds on the recruitment in 2009 of a new Assistant National Director with dedicated responsibility for Children and Family services.</P>
        <P>The recruitment process for the new National Director of Children and Family Services is at the final stage and an announcement will be made very shortly by the HSE in this regard.</P>

	<P>The HSE has established an Incident Management Team to coordinate the national recall of patients who received specific hip replacement products manufactured by DePuy Orthopaedics.  Approximately 3,300 patients have received these implants in Ireland, in public or private hospitals, and they have been invited for a recall assessment and possible treatment.  It is expected that for most patients this process will be precautionary only and that further treatment will not be needed.  The Incident Management Team includes a patient representative and member of the Irish Institute of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery and of the independent hospital sector, to ensure coordinated management of this issue.  The Team is also in contact with the company in relation to the fulfilment of the commitment by DePuy to cover the costs of the recall process and any <Col N="178"/>remedial treatment that may be required.  In the circumstances I have no plans to establish financial support arrangements such as the Deputy has suggested.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) that concerns about the potential for Lariam to cause neuropsychiatric disorders have been identified and reviewed at both national and EU level.  As new information on the product has become available, the product information leaflet has been updated and now includes the following: </P>
        <P el="5" LI="1">&ldquo;Patients with a history of psychiatric disturbances (including depression) or convulsions should not be prescribed Lariam prophylactically, as it may precipitate these conditions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P el="5" LI="1">&ldquo;Lariam can cause neuropsychiatric disturbances. If psychiatric disturbances occur during prophylactic use, Lariam should be discontinued and an alternative prophylactic agent should <Col N="180"/>be recommended.  Disturbances have ranged from confusion and anxiety to severe neuropsychiatric effects (including hallucinations, psychotic or paranoid reactions, depression), and symptoms may persist up to several weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Rare cases of suicidal ideation and suicide have been reported though no relationship to drug administration has been confirmed. Patients with a history of psychiatric disturbances should not be prescribed Lariam prophylactically.</P>
       <P el="5" LI="1">Patients should be advised to obtain medical advice before the next weekly dose of Lariam, if any concerning or neuropsychiatric symptoms develop. Discontinuation of Lariam should be considered, particularly if neuropsychiatric reactions occur. The need for alternative antimalarial therapy or prophylaxis can then be evaluated.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>The estimates published on 7 December 2010 show that there is a reduction of &euro;5.5 million in the estimate for regional airports current expenditure in 2011 as against the 2010 estimate. This reduction relates to the curtailment of public service contracts for air services. The current Public Service Obligation (PSO) contracts for services linking Dublin Airport with the regional airports at Derry, Donegal, Sligo, Ireland West Airport Knock, Galway and Kerry Airports commenced on 22 July 2008 and are due to expire on 21 July 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware of the Value for Money (VFM) Review of Exchequer Expenditure on the regional airports programme was recently completed. The review was carried out to assist me in evaluating the appropriate scale of a regional airports programme in future years bearing in mind aviation policy objectives, the updated EU legislation, the improved surface links under the NDP and Transport 21 and the need to address the difficulties with our public finances.  The Review is being considered by Government and it is intended that it will be published shortly.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on any likely PSO scheme beyond 2011 in advance of the Government decision in the matter.</P>

A member of the local Community Policing Unit is specifically assigned to the area referred to and attends residents&rsquo; meetings to help address their concerns.

Community policing is a central feature and core value of Garda policing policy, and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.</P>

	<P>There are a number of provisions in the law for ensuring that payments continue to be made by spouses in support of their dependent spouses and children.  They include enabling powers for the courts to order attachment of the earnings of a debtor spouse, to order the securing of payments to the maintenance creditor, to order the payment of lump sums and to order arrears of maintenance to be paid by instalments.</P>
        <P>A High Court judgment last year had implications for sections 6 (imprisonment in the case of non-payment of debt) and 8 (imprisonment relating to non-payment of maintenance) of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940. The Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 made changes to both sections consequent on that judgment in accordance with legal advice.  While the law generally operates successfully in this area my attention has been drawn to the fact that difficulties have arisen in some cases. As a result, I have published proposals for the better enforcement of maintenance orders. These proposals are contained in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 which is currently before the House.</P>

	<P>There has been no change in the processing of applications for Subsidiary Protection as referred to by the Deputy.  On a regular and ongoing basis my Department assesses the cases on hand to ensure that, as far as possible, persons who are waiting for a decision for the longest periods have their cases finalised first.  The factual position is that any case where an application for Subsidiary Protection has been made will be considered in accordance with the legislation i.e. the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  When consideration of the application has been completed, the applicant is notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the applicant&rsquo;s case file, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under the various headings set out in Section 3(6) of the 1999 Act.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person referred to by the Deputy made an application to change his current immigration status on the 14 October 2010.  Applications are dealt with in chronological order and I am informed that officials in INIS will be in touch with this person shortly.</P>
        <P>I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that unaccompanied minors are dealt with in accordance with section 8(5)(<i>a</i>) of the Refugee Act 1996  (as amended) which provides that, where it appears to an Immigration Officer or an authorised officer that a child under the age of 18 years who has arrived in the state and is not in the custody of any person, that child must, as soon as is practicable be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) and thereupon the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991 apply to the child.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is open to the unaccompanied minors to apply for refugee status if they so wish.  All asylum applications, whether they relate to adults or children, require <Col N="187"/>an investigation to be carried out to determine whether refugee status should be granted or refused. Clearly in the context of determining asylum applications involving unaccompanied children, regard will be had for the age and maturity of the child. In circumstances where an unaccompanied minor is placed in the care of the HSE pursuant to the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, the making of a decision with regard to an asylum application is taken by the HSE on behalf of the child.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might also wish to note that in the instances where refugee status is refused, the unaccompanied children involved will be made aware of the entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State and to submit written representations to the Minister as to why a Deportation Order should not be made and any such communications are again copied to the HSE and to the child&rsquo;s legal representative.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to dis-aggregate the cases of previously unaccompanied children who were subsequently granted permission to remain in the State from the overall figures for persons granted permission to remain in the State.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might also wish to note that it is not uncommon for persons arriving in the State as unaccompanied children to be re-united with family members already in the State and once such re-unification is achieved, the HSE will no longer be required to act as guardian to such children.</P>

        <Quest> the rules currently applicable to granting permission to non-EU citizens who wish to move to and work in Ireland to do so; the number of such applications received during the period 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009 and 1 January 2010 to 30 November 2010; the nationality of the individual applicants in the case of each of the aforesaid periods; and the number of applicants who were successful and granted permission to reside in and work here; the numbers unsuccessful and their nationalities in each case. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The current position with regard to non-EEA nationals who wish to move to and work in Ireland is that certain such nationals are required to apply for a work permit to take up employment in the State.  The issuing of work permits is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade, and Innovation.  When a work permit is secured, the individual, if from a visa required country must apply for the appropriate visa to enter the State.  If the person is belonging to the class of non-nationals who are not visa required,  they are expected to produce documentation at the port of entry to satisfy the Immigration Officer of their intent.  When in the State, all non-EEA nationals who intend to remain here longer than 90 days must register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau where their passport will be endorsed with the appropriate immigration stamp and a Garda National Registration card will be issued to them.</P>
        <P>The categories of persons also given access to the labour market in the State and not requiring a work permit to take up employment include spouses of Irish Nationals, partners in a de facto relationship with an Irish national, who meet the qualifying criteria, spouses and dependants of EU nationals, persons who were granted permission to enter the State as researchers, persons who are granted refugee status in the State, family members of refugees who are granted family reunification.  Persons who hold permission to remain under these categories are also entitled to seek employment in the State by virtue of holding such permission.  All persons in these categories are required to register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>
        <P>Due to the range of categories of persons who are allowed to come and work in the State and, in certain circumstances, overlapping conditions related to their permission to remain, it is not possible in the time available to dis-aggregate the numbers and nationalities of such persons as requested by the Deputy.  However, the following statistical information has been provided by the Work Permits Division in the Department of Enterprise, Trade, and Innovation which will give the Deputy the numbers of Employment permits issued in the year 2009 and up to 31 October 2010.  The numbers of permits issued include nationals already in the State but who have changed jobs.</P>

        <P>Since the commencement of the investigation, 221 stolen vehicles have been recovered.  Twenty three persons have been arrested, some of whom have been convicted for offences relating to deception, handling or possession of stolen vehicles or possession of counterfeit documents.  Four of those convicted had prison sentences imposed, while others were ordered to pay compensation to unsuspecting parties who had purchased such stolen vehicles.  Two persons are awaiting trial.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that Operation Foolscap was established in the Galway Garda Division in October 2009.  It is an ongoing operation targeting the activities of a particular organised crime group.</P>
        <P>The number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na involved in the Operation  can vary with up to 150 Garda&iacute; involved at certain times, including members of the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and Crime &amp; Security personnel.</P>
        <P>To date, thirteen charges have been preferred against ten persons arrested on foot of the Operation. The charges relate to a range of alleged offences including offences under the following provisions:  Section 71A of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 as inserted by section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 (directing a criminal organisation); Section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 as inserted by section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 (participating etc in organised crime); Section 12 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 (Burglary); Sections 3 and 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 and 1984 (possession of controlled drugs and possession of  controlled drugs for unlawful sale or supply).  Drugs, including cannabis herb and a quantity of cocaine, with a total estimate street-value of approximately &euro;57,000 have been seized. No firearms or stolen property have been recovered to date.  The cost of this Operation, which remains ongoing, is not readily available and would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to calculate same.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The investigation by Judge Michael Reilly, Inspector of Prisons, into the handling of the sentencing, release and post release procedures in the criminal matter that is the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s Question highlighted a number of very serious failings which took place across four criminal justice agencies following the sentencing in absentia of an individual to a four year term of imprisonment. <Col N="196"/>Several of the failures resulted from human error and others occurred because of the lack of systematic procedures to pick up on these errors when they occurred. </P>
        <P>As I outlined to the House on 7 December 2010, I appointed Mr. Pat Folan, a former Director General of the immigration services, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations put forward by Judge Reilly.  Significant changes have since been introduced to the system on foot of Judge Reilly&rsquo;s report with the aim of ensuring that the mistakes such as those identified will not reoccur. The progress achieved is detailed in the report of the Implementation Group which has been laid before the Houses and is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.justice.iehttp://www.justice.ie/.</P>
        <P>The new procedures that are now in place will serve to increase efficiency and effectiveness and enhance the overall accountability requirements on agencies and individual officials, as well as promote the timely sharing of relevant information between the Justice agencies.</P>

        <QRef>[47312/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Garda&iacute; for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives &mdash; 187,864 in 2007; 218,404 in 2008 and 246,194 in 2009.  At present, there are approximately 60,000 vetting applications in the course of being processed.</P>
        <P>The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates in line with periods of increased demand.  Furthermore, additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process.  However, the Garda makes every effort to reduce the time to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately ten weeks.</P>
        <P>The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  There are currently a total of 89 garda&iacute; and Garda civilian personnel assigned to the Vetting Unit, including an additional ten persons recruited to the Unit on a temporary basis due to the current high volume of applications.  Overall, this represents a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development in Garda vetting began in 2005.  In addition, overall staffing arrangements at the Unit are kept under review.</P>

Publication of this house price data will ensure the required level of market transparency and meet the needs of statutory and other bodies involved in tracking market trends and compiling statistical data on the property market.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 196 together.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I make appointments to four bodies &mdash; the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange (the Fulbright Commission), the Development Education Advisory Committee and the Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group.</P>
        <P>I re-appointed Ms. Una Halligan to the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange for a fourth two-year term with effect from 11 December 2010, and I re-appointed Professor Geraldine McCarthy to the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange for a second two-year term with effect from 11 December 2010.  The Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange enjoys autonomy of management and administration in accordance with section 2(5) of the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991. Members of the Commission serve without remuneration but they are reimbursed by the Commission for reasonable expenses necessarily incurred by them in the discharge of their functions.</P>
        <P>None of the other bodies have had appointments made to them in the period in question.</P>
        <P>I make appointments to the Emigrant Services Advisory Committee (ESAC) following consultations with our Embassy in London and the Irish Abroad Unit in my Department.  The question of the appointment of a new committee is currently under consideration by the Embassy in London and appointments will likely be made early in 2011 for a two-year term.  The committee consists of twelve members, including two officers from our Embassy in London, who act as Chair and Secretary to the committee. The ten voluntary committee members were appointed in May 2009 and their term runs until 31 December 2010.  The primary role of the committee is to advise me on the allocation of grants to Irish community organisations in Britain under the Emigrant Support Programme.</P>
        <P>No appointments to the other bodies which fall under the aegis of my Department are envisaged for the period in question.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the claim by Denmark and the Faroe Islands to the United Nations for a portion of the North Sea continental shelf which is part of the Rockall area in the Atlantic claimed by Ireland; the impact this will have on Ireland&rsquo;s claim; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[47224/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea each State Party to the Convention is entitled to continental shelf for 200 nautical lines from its coast.  States with an extended continental shelf that stretches beyond 200 nautical miles are obliged to lodge a claim with the UN Commission on the Limits <Col N="199"/>of the Continental Shelf within 10 years of becoming party to the Convention.  Ireland claims continental shelf extending beyond 200 nautical miles both to the west and to the south of the country.  For the purposes of our claims we have divided the extended shelf into three sectors.  One of these three sectors lies in part of the Hatton-Rockall Area of the North-East Atlantic, which extends up to 500 nautical miles from the State&rsquo;s west coast.  There is an agreed Ireland-UK boundary here but it is not accepted by Iceland or the Faroe Islands, which make their own claims in this area.  The four countries have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the overlapping claims issue,  but to date have been unable to reach agreement.  The 10-year deadline for the making of submissions to the UN Commission expired for Ireland in May 2009.  The Government therefore lodged the national claim for this area at the end of March 2009.  The deadline for the Faroe Islands is 2014 (because Denmark, which is responsible for the foreign relations of the Faroe Islands, only became a party to the Convention on the Law of the Sea in 2004) and the authorities in the Faroes had kept us informed of their intention to make their submission this year.  That submission was lodged with the Commission in New York on 2 December last.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s rules of procedure prevent consideration of a submission concerning a disputed area without the consent of all the states concerned.  Accordingly the purpose of making submissions in accordance with the deadline, as Ireland, the UK and the Faroes have all now done, is to stop the clock on the deadline and preserve each country&rsquo;s legal position.  In the meantime, the four states intend to keep the matter under regular review and will meet again in the New Year.  We continue to work for the creation of conditions that will permit consideration of Ireland&rsquo;s submission by the Commission as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The State&rsquo;s continental shelf has already been successfully extended beyond 200 nautical miles in the area to the west of the Porcupine Bank where 39,000 square kilometres of additional seabed has recently been designated under the 1968 Continental Shelf Act.  Together with France, Spain and the UK, we have also made a successful submission to the UN Commission in relation to a large area of seabed in the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay and the four countries have recently begun discussions on its division between them.</P>

These remain unsubstantiated allegations and have not been raised with the US authorities. </P>
        <P>Together with our EU partners, Ireland continues to encourage the US to bring about the closure of the detention facility at Guant&aacute;namo Bay in the shortest possible time and to treat those detained there in accordance with the requirements of international human rights law and international humanitarian law.</P>

	<P>I understand that the Deputy has clarified that he is referring to State pensions.</P>
        <P>There are three types of State pension: State pension (transition), State pension (contributory)  and State pension (non-contributory).  Both State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory) are among a number of social welfare schemes based upon social insurance.  Payments based on social insurance contributions are funded through pay-related contributions to the social insurance fund by employers, employees and the self-employed with subvention, where necessary, by the State.  In the case of contributory pensions, payment is made on reaching pension age provided the qualifying conditions, which include having paid a minimum number of contributions at an appropriate rate and reaching a minimum average annual contribution rate, have been met.  There are no residency conditions attached to con<Col N="201"/>tributory payments as the pensioner has built up an entitlement based on contributions paid over his/her working life.</P>
        <P>The State pension (non-contributory) is a means-tested payment for persons over 66 years of age and is funded entirely by taxation.  All income is assessable as means and this includes cash income, private pensions, foreign pensions, the value of any property (excluding the claimant&rsquo;s own home) and the value of any investments, monies held in financial institutions and capital which the claimant or their spouse may have.  A person seeking the payment must also be habitually resident in the State.</P>
        <P>The current Government policy in relation to pensions is laid out in the National Pensions Framework which was launched in March of this year. The framework includes a number of changes to the State pension in order to make it more transparent, simple and equitable for those reaching pension age.  Among the changes outlined are changes to the social insurance conditions and increases to the State pension age however there are no plans to alter the residency requirements or reduce the pensions of those who are non-residents.</P>

	<P>The qualifying conditions for State pension (transition) require the applicant to:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 55 years.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have at least 260 paid contribution weeks, from employment since entry into insurance.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />satisfy the yearly average condition.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The person concerned applied for State pension (transition) in May 2010.  His claim was disallowed on the grounds that he does not satisfy the yearly average condition, as he only has a yearly average of 14 PRSI contributions from the date of his commencement of insurable employment to the end of the last full tax year prior to his 65th birthday. A yearly average of at least 24 would be required to qualify for State pension (transition).  Any PRSI contributions in respect of periods of self-employment are specifically excluded from calculations to determine entitlement to State pension (transition), although they can be used to determine entitlement to State pension (contributory).  A yearly average of at least 10 would be required to qualify for State pension (contributory) from age 66.</P>

	<P>The medical appliance benefit scheme is a scheme under which qualified customers may reclaim part of the cost of the purchase or repair of a hearing aid. Eligibility is based on PRSI contributions. </P>
        <P>Only PRSI classes A, E, H, and P are reckonable for eligibility for this benefit. Neither the person concerned nor her spouse have sufficient qualifying PRSI contributions paid. They have most recently paid Class S (self-employed) contributions, which do not count towards qualifying for this benefit. Therefore neither person is qualified.</P>

	<P>Mortgage interest supplement is subject to a means test which is normally calculated to ensure that, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, an eligible person has income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently &euro;24, which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that there is no entitlement to mortgage interest supplement in this case as the weekly mortgage interest payable by the person concerned of &euro;23.80 is less than the weekly minimum contribution of &euro;24 that applicants are obliged to pay from their own resources.</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 56 years.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have at least 260 paid contribution weeks, from employment or self-employment, since entry into insurance.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />satisfy the yearly average condition.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The person concerned satisfies the above conditions and has a total of 628 reckonable (paid and credited) PRSI contributions.  When this total is divided by 47 (the number of years from date of entry into insurance to the end of the last tax year prior to reaching age 66), this gives a yearly average of 13 contributions, and entitles her to a reduced State pension (contributory) of &euro;115.20 (50% of the maximum rate).</P>
        <P>As the spouse of the person concerned is currently in receipt of an increase for qualified adult (IQA) of &euro;130.10 per week in his jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in respect of her, it was considered more financially beneficial to reject the claim for State pension (contributory) in favour of continued IQA payment at the higher rate.</P>

	<P>Supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE) on behalf of the Department. Neither I nor my Department has any input into individual decisions.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that the person concerned was refused a rent supplement on the grounds that his rent was in excess of the limit prescribed for his family circumstances. The HSE has further advised that this decision was upheld by the HSE&rsquo;s designated Appeals Officer and that this decision was subsequently upheld also by the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
        <P>As I stated in my previous reply every claim for rent supplement is determined by the HSE having regard to the particular circumstances of the applicant.  Any person seeking a rent supplement must first satisfy the Executive that they have a housing need that they are unable to meet from their own resources. In addition, the Executive must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant.  In a case where parents have joint custody of a child, the needs of both parents to have adequate accommodation to look after the child are taken into account by the Executive when an application for a rent supplement is being determined.</P>
        <P>It is open to the person concerned to apply for rent supplement in respect of accommodation below the prescribed rent limit.</P>
        <P>There are no statistics available on the payment of rent supplement in relation to household affected by joint custody orders.</P>

        <P>He chose neither, and from 7 July 2005 to 2010 while he was in employment, he did not repay any part of this overpayment. This is despite the fact that his income from employment was in excess of the average industrial wage.</P>

        <Quest> if, in view of the equalisation of PRSI rates paid by employees and the self-employed as announced in budget 2011, self-employed workers will be entitled to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2011, self-employed workers will be liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% &mdash; the same personal rate as is paid by ordinary employees. </P>
        <P>However, employers also make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class <Col N="215"/>A.  As a result, ordinary employees can build entitlement towards the full range of social welfare benefits. Class S contributions will continue to provide cover for long-term benefits such as state pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s/widower&rsquo;s pension (contributory) only.</P>
        <P>PRSI coverage is related to the risks associated with employment or self-employment, the annualised system of contributions for self-employed people and the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payment for self-employed people. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</P>
        <P>It may also be noted that the 2005 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, found that the fund favours the self-employed over the employed when both employer and employee contributions are included in respect of the employed person. The analysis demonstrates that, despite the fact that they are eligible for a narrower range of benefits, self-employed persons can gain substantially more from the fund than employees.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.</P>

	<P>The club in question applied for funding under the 2007 and 2008 Sports Capital Programmes.  These eligible applications were assessed and received grant funding under the programme of &euro;750,000 in 2007 and &euro;500,000 in 2008. These provisional allocations were made towards the new stadium in Stranorlar.  The club was also successful under the 1999 programme and received a grant of &euro;190,461 for Finn Park.  </P>
        <P>These grant allocations are subject to the terms and conditions of the Programme, which include the execution of a Deed of Covenant and Charge. A Deed provides, inter alia, for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. The Department&rsquo;s legal adviser, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office <Col N="217"/>(CSSO), deals with the grantee&rsquo;s solicitor in executing this Deed.  The signed deeds were returned to the CSSO at the start of December for onwards transmission to the Club&rsquo;s solicitor.  Once the legalities have been finalised and it is understood that they are almost completed, arrangements for a payment will be made.</P>

	<P>Capital funding for arts and cultural projects supported by my Department is primarily provided from the Cultural Development subhead, D5, of Vote 35 of the Revised Estimates Volume.  </P>
        <P>Under this subhead, capital grants have been awarded for the development of arts and cultural infrastructure throughout the country.  Integrated arts centres, theatres, museums, galleries, arts studios and creative and performance spaces have received capital funding. The purchase of buildings is not considered as eligible expenditure under this subhead. A capital grant of &euro;14,000 was provided in 2010 to the Complex Arts Space for stage lighting equipment.</P>
        <P>Current funding for organisations such as Complex Arts Space is normally provided by the Arts Council, who are statutorily independent in making funding decisions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 and 257 together:</P><Col N="218"/>
        <P>Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  Generally speaking, waiver schemes do not operate in respect of privately supplied collection services.</P>
        <P>My Department has previously engaged with the Department of Social Protection to explore the issues involved in relation to waivers.  These discussions did not identify a role for the social welfare system in providing income support in that regard.</P>
        <P>My Department also understands that previous legal advice obtained by a local authority suggests that in an area which is serviced by the private sector the local authority may not provide a waiver in respect of charges for a service which is not directly provided by the local authority. However, a local authority does have discretion itself to provide a waste collection service, including a waiver of some or all of the charges which it may determine, or to procure competitively for a service provider to collect waste on its behalf. The Programme for Government   agreed in 2007 signalled a fundamental change of policy in relation to waste management. The Programme&rsquo;s objectives to implement this policy change included a commitment to carry out an international review of waste management plans, practices and procedures and to act on the conclusions. The report, by a group of Irish and international consultants engaged to carry out a major study to underpin the conclusion of the review, was published in November 2009.</P>
        <P>In July 2010, I published a Draft Statement of Waste Policy for public consultation as part of the development of a new national waste management policy for the coming decade and beyond.  One of its proposals is to make local authorities responsible for collection of household waste.  This would provide a framework, through which they, or one or more agents acting on their behalf, would be able to deliver high quality services, while affording operators the economies of scale provided by such an organisation of the market.</P>
        <P>Delivery of such a changed market structure would be achieved through a competitive tendering process.  This approach would in turn facilitate the delivery of various public service obligations including the provision of waivers for customers of both public and private sectors, ensuring that the cost of such provision is borne in an equitable manner.  The public consultation period has now closed and I am currently examining the 77 submissions received with a view to finalising the Waste Policy Statement and bringing it to Government at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the terms of the Local Government Act 2001, it is in the first instance a matter for each local authority to prepare and adopt a balanced annual budget for the coming year.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are required to adopt budgets which are sufficient to meet the expenditure arising in the year in accordance with the terms of section 10A of the City and County Management Act 1955, as inserted in that Act by section 113 of the Local Government Act 2001.   General-Purpose Grants are the contribution that my Department makes to local authorities to meet the gap between the cost to them of providing a reasonable level of day-to-day services and the income they obtain from other sources. A total of &euro;790m in General-Purpose Grants will be provided to local authorities from the Local Government Fund for 2011. These grants are allocated having regard to a range of factors including the overall funding available for the grants, the cost to each local authority of providing its services, the income available to each local authority from local sources and specific grants, and the need to ensure that each local authority receives a baseline allocation that will provide financial stability.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the general purpose allocations I have provided for 2011, together with the income available from other sources, will enable Roscommon and Leitrim County Councils to provide a reasonable level of service to their customers.</P>

	<P>In order to be able to vote at elections and referenda in this jurisdiction, a person&rsquo;s name must be entered in the register of electors for a constituency in the State in which the person ordinarily resides. </P>
        <P>Postal voting is provided for in electoral law in respect of certain categories of person who are entered in the register of electors. The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by whole-time members of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and Irish diplo<Col N="220"/>mats serving abroad and their spouses. Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996); electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day and full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State &mdash; in these cases, the law provides for completion of the necessary voting documentation at a Garda station (the Electoral Act 1997); certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001); and electors who  because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006).</P>
        <P>While electoral law is subject to ongoing review I have no proposals at present to alter existing arrangements for postal voting.</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 17 of 25 November 2010.  My Department is currently reviewing the Retail Planning Guidelines which were originally published in 2001 and updated in 2005.</P>
        <P>An Issues Paper, which set out high-level and strategic issues for retail planning, was published in June 2010 to provide an opportunity for stakeholders and interested parties to assist in identifying key issues to be considered in the context of preparing and drafting revised guidelines.  Almost 200 submissions were received through this consultation process and the issues raised in these submissions are currently being examined in drafting the updated guidelines.</P>
        <P>It is intended that revised draft guidelines will be published for public consultation early next year, thus affording stakeholders and interested parties a further opportunity to input into the policy formulation process before the statutory guidelines are finalised later in 2011.  In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality between Ireland and the EU/IMF, the review is also addressing the issue of the cap on retail floor space contained in the current guidelines.</P>

In these situations. Limerick City Council, in partnership with the Limerick Regeneration Agencies, may offer replacement housing within the regeneration areas or within the City Council area, and, subject to compliance with an agreed protocol with Limerick County Council and Clare County Council, within the administrative areas of Limerick County and Clare County Councils.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding moneys contributed to the Global Climate Change Alliance; the person to whom this money will be allocated and the amount of same; the projects on which the money will be spent; the way the moneys will be administered; the oversight of the expenditure of the moneys that will take place; if overseas aid will play any role in relation to the expenditure; the amount of moneys in total that Ireland has committed to pay to the <Col N="230"/>Global Climate Change Alliance in addition to the contribution; the dates on which we agreed we have to pay our contribution; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Following approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, my Department is in the process of finalising arrangements to make the fast start finance contribution of &euro;23 million which was the subject of the supplementary estimate debate at the Select Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 9 December 2010.  As indicated in my statement on the supplementary estimate, the contribution will be made through the Global Climate Change Alliance established and operated by the European Commission.  The contribution, once transferred to the Commission, will be used together with other EU funding provided through the Alliance, in accordance with the main objectives which I set out in my statement.  Administrative and oversight arrangements are elements of the ongoing discussions between my Department and the European Commission.</P>
        <P>The contribution is additional to overseas development assistance.  However, it is positive that the Alliance is already active in a number of Ireland&rsquo;s priority overseas development assistance (ODA) countries.  My preference, which is being pursued in the discussions with the Commission, would be to target our contribution to support adaptation in one or a number of our priority ODA countries.</P>
        <P>The fast start finance package was a positive outcome at the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009, and I am pleased that the outcome of the recent Canc&uacute;n climate conference shows welcome signs of progress in rebuilding trust between the Parties and moving the process forward.</P>
        <P>The developed country Parties who associated with the Copenhagen Accord (including the EU and all Member States) agreed to provide the fast start finance package for developing countries over the three years 2010 to 2012.  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment made at Copenhagen is for a &euro;100 million contribution over the three year period.  The practical arrangements for making the actual contributions are a matter for each of the developed countries supporting the package.</P>
        <P>I cannot over-emphasise the responsibility that rests on developed countries to strengthen and progress the international negotiations by honouring the fast-start-funding commitment in the Copenhagen Accord.  The proposed contribution through the Global Climate Change Alliance is a very positive step for Ireland, both in helping developing countries deal with climate change and in supporting the ongoing international effort to find agreement on an effective global response.</P>

        <Quest> if, in view of the position taken by National Parks and Wildlife Service to ban the hunting and shooting of wild birds because of the severe weather, he will consider a similar ban on the hunting of mammals such as fox, hare, deer and so on. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Due to the recent severe weather conditions I decided to introduce a temporary closure of the hunting season for wild birds for the period from 8 December, 2010.  This temporary closure ends tonight (14 December).  </P>
        <P>I have no powers to control the hunting of foxes as they are not a protected species under the Wildlife Acts.  I did not consider it necessary to ban the hunting of deer or hares or other <Col N="231"/>animals protected under the Wildlife Acts. I am aware that some of the hunting bodies brought in voluntary hunting bans for deer for their members and I appreciate their efforts in this regard.  In relation to hares I understand that a number of coursing meetings were postponed during the recent severe weather.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to monitor and review the situation regarding the hunting of wild game on a daily basis as long as the threat of very cold weather persists.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the amount spent in my Department on refreshments for meetings and functions, in 2008, 2009 and to date in 2010 from the Department&rsquo;s catering allocation, is as set it in the table below.</P>
        <P>There has been an ongoing review of spending and value for money analysis across the administrative budget over the last three years.  As the Deputy will see this review has resulted in significant decreases in spending over the period in question.</P>
        <P>There is a small additional spend on refreshments from &ldquo;programme&rdquo; allocations in respect of some meetings but this small spend is not disaggregated from the overall spend in these instances.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the draft code of practice from premium rate phone services as published by ComReg has no provision for refunds unlike its RegTel predecessor; if his further attention has been drawn to other areas that are not covered by this new draft code of practice that were previously covered by RegTel; his views on these changes; if he has been alerted to instances where companies are in breach of RegTel&rsquo;s code of practice but have not been investigated by ComReg; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic Communications Infrastructure) Act 2010 transferred the function of regulating premium rate services to ComReg.  Under that Act, ComReg shall make regulations specifying the licence conditions which premium rate service providers must comply with.  These conditions will include the basis and <Col N="232"/>circumstances upon which refunds may be made.  Section 9 of the Act, also provides that where ComReg finds that a premium rate service provider has not complied with or has breached a condition attached to his or her licence, it shall require the provider to remedy the non-compliance or breach and to refund any charge imposed by the provider on any end user in respect of the premium rate service connected with the non-compliance or breach within a specified time period.</P>
        <P>Unlike the previous regulatory regime, which was governed by a non-statutory code of practice, the provisions of the 2010 Act place the regulation of premium rate services and the issue of refunds on a statutory basis, and thus ensure that the users of premium rate services are fully protected in law.  As ComReg is independent in its functions, it is a matter for ComReg to determine, following consultation with all stakeholders, whether the code of practice should also include provisions for refunds.</P>
        <P>It shall be a condition of a premium rate service licence that any code of practice to be published by ComReg will be complied with.  I am confident that ComReg, in consultation with all interested parties, will ensure that its code of practice will include all the necessary provisions that are necessary for the effective regulation of this sector.</P>

        <Quest> the amount spent on fossil fuel imports for each year 2007, 2008, 2009 and to date in 2010; if he will provide a breakdown of total fossil fuel use here across the main sectors; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Energy Policy and Statistical Support Unit (EPSSU) of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland gather and publish a wide range of data on energy related matters.  This includes detailed data on energy consumption and prices, broken down by sector.</P>
        <P>SEAI does not publish official financial estimates due to the inherent difficulties associated with the fact that fuel prices change through time, and different prices are charged for different volumes.  Specific data on the amount spent on imports is therefore not available; however it is possible to estimate overall expenditure by the consumer on the basis of an overall price approximation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 268 and 269 together. </P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter for private sector service providers operating in a liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.</P>
        <P>ComReg&rsquo;s website www.callcosts.ie   provides detailed information on the various private sector telecommunications products and services available on a county by county basis, including County Donegal.</P>
        <P>Broadband services are now available throughout the entire National Broadband Scheme area and a list of the Electoral Divisions (EDs) covered by the NBS in County Donegal is provided below.</P>
        <P>However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend, subject to Government approval, to formally announce the launch of a Rural Broadband Scheme before the end of this year.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises <Col N="234"/>outside of the NBS areas. Un-served premises in Crove Upper, Carrick, County Donegal, will be eligible to apply under the scheme.</P>
        <P>There will be a competitive process to engage a service provider who will offer a broadband service to qualified applicants under the scheme.</P>
        <P>While the exact details have yet to be finalised, I expect that the service offered under this scheme would at least match the service offered under the NBS.  This process will be technology neutral &mdash; it will be a matter for the bidders to decide which technical approach they propose in their bids.</P>
        <P>Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</P>

	<P>The provision of electronic communications networks and services is undertaken by telecommunications service providers who operate in a fully liberalised market. The regulation of telecommunications service providers, including regulatory issues<b></b>  surrounding fixed line and broadband services is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), in accordance with its functions under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, as amended, and the EU Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications.</P>
        <P>In accordance with Regulation 3(4) of the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and User&rsquo;s Rights) Regulations 2003 (S.I. No. 308 of 2003), ComReg may specify requirements to be complied with by the designated Universal Service Provider (eircom) in relation to the reasonableness of requests for connection at a fixed location to the public telephone network.  ComReg currently deem a threshold level of &euro;7,000 on expenditure for connection to the public telephone network at the standard connection charge to be a reasonable and proportionate cost to be borne by the USP. Where connection cost exceeds this threshold, applicants will be offered the option of getting service by paying the excess above the &euro;7,000 limit.</P>
        <P>There are, however, a number of platforms for delivery of broadband. Service providers are now offering broadband by fixed wireless, mobile, satellite, cable, fibre or DSL over standard telephone cable across the country.  The general area of Broadford, County Clare is covered by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  The NBS service provider &ldquo;3&rdquo; is providing broadband services in all of the designated Electoral Divisions within the NBS area, including in the Broadford area.  3 may be contacted at telephone number 1800944791 regarding the National Broadband Scheme.</P>

        <P>The following table sets out the 2010 estimate, the 2010 spend to end November and the 2011 estimate as announced in last weeks Budget for the expenditure programmes raised by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>While it is likely that there will be some under spend at year end, it is expected that it will be lower than end November spend might suggest as timing issues resolve themselves and increased uptake on some programmes translates into increased expenditure.</P>

	<P>An application under the 2010 Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 10 May 2010. However a number of the land parcels listed on the application required digitisation. An advance payment under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme issued to the person named on 21 September and an advance payment under Single Payment Scheme issued on 18 October in respect of the clear eligible area. A balancing payment under Single Payment Scheme issued on 1 December based on the clear eligible area. </P>
        <P>An official from my Department has made direct contact with the person named in relation to a mapping issue that arose during the processing of the application. The applicant is submitting a map to enable my Department resolve this outstanding query.</P>
        <P>Immediately this process is complete, provided no further errors are identified, the application will be processed in full with a view to payments due issuing shortly thereafter.</P>

        <P>This application was selected for a Ground Eligibility and Animal Identification Inspection. The inspection process is complete and the results have now been processed.</P>
        <P>During the course of the Ground Eligibility inspection discrepancies were found with the following parcels G29626023 and G29637024. Inadequate deductions were made for scrub and swamp/bog was found in parcel G29828016. This resulted in the claimed area of 18.77ha being <Col N="240"/>reduced to 11.69ha. As there is an over declaration of over 20% no payment will be made under the Single Payment Scheme/ Disadvantaged Area Scheme for the year in question.</P>
        <P>A formal decision issued to the person named on 1 October 2010 that advised him of his right to seek a review of the decision within 21 days to the District Inspector and of his right to appeal the outcome of any such review to the Independent Agriculture Appeals Office.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 293 to 295, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>I am aware from ongoing communications between officials of my Department and representatives of Local Authorities and Animal Welfare Organisations that there is a continuing risk of abandonment of horses. Horses are usually found straying or abandoned on waste lands/public roads etc and Local Authorities have powers to deal with these issues under the Control of Horses Act 1996.  This Act assigns to Local Authorities the primary role for dealing with such horses and it contains provisions on the seizure and detention of stray horses, the confiscation of horses which stray repeatedly and the disposal of seized horses.</P>
        <P>In view of the pressure being placed on Local Authorities in dealing with an increasing number of abandoned horses, I have to date this year approved payments of almost &euro;2 million to Local Authorities to assist them in their work under the Control of Horses Act. The issue is not one of funding but on how to bring greater efficiencies to the operation of the Act in dealing with, for example, horses that are found wandering and straying repeatedly. In this respect, officials of my Department are continuing to work with Local Authority representatives on a strategy to improve implementation of the Act throughout the Local Authority areas and will examine those Local Authority areas where the Control of Horses Act has been working particularly well with a view to extending some of the best practices to all areas.</P>
        <P>Mindful too of the work carried out by welfare bodies in delivering animal welfare, in December 2009 my Department made ex-gratia payments totalling &euro;1.185m to 112 animal welfare organisations to assist with their work during in 2010. My officials are in regular contact with representatives of welfare bodies, particularly through the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council and they have asked those welfare organisations that have the capacity to deal with larger animals, such as horses, to consider placing greater resources in promoting horse welfare.  In July last, in response to my Department&rsquo;s invitation to animal welfare bodies on provision of ex-gratia funding in 2010 a large number of applications were received. Processing of these applications is now being finalised and I expect shortly to be in a position to announce this year&rsquo;s funding to welfare organisations.</P><Col N="244"/>
        <P>I would like to emphasise that, regardless of the amount of state funding being provided to assist with horse welfare, owners and keepers are ultimately responsible for protecting the welfare of animals in their care. The main legislation in the State governing cruelty to horses is the Protection of Animals Act 1911 and the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act 1965 which states that any person causing cruelty or unnecessary suffering to any animal shall be guilty of an offence. This legislation is enforced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department&rsquo;s statutory responsibility extends to the welfare and protection of farmed animals only i.e. animals normally bred or kept for the production of food or for use in or for the purpose of farming. However, the Government recently approved for drafting the Animal Health and Welfare Bill which gives effect to commitments in the Programmes for Government, including the updating of existing animal health and welfare legislation to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farmed animals, is properly protected and penalties for offenders are increased significantly. The Bill provides for my Department to assume responsibility for policy and legislation relating both to the health and welfare of all animals, including non-farmed animals, but it is envisaged that, for practical reasons, operational responsibility will remain with local authorities, the Garda etc, where it is more efficiently discharged.  An important provision of the Bill will provide for powers of intervention where an animal is deemed to be at risk. It is also proposed that there will be a specific duty of care on owners/keepers to ensure that the welfare and well-being of animals is adequately protected as well as addressing such issues as the prevention of unnecessary suffering of animals and abandonment of animals.</P>

	<P>An application under 2010 Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 6 May 2010. The 75% advance payment under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the 50% advance payment under the Single Payment Scheme, which issued on 21 September and 18 October 2010 respectively, were on the basis of the land cleared at that stage, as a number of parcels declared required digitising.</P>
        <P>Balancing payments under the scheme, would, in normal circumstances, be confined to those whose applications are fully processed, specifically, where all digitising is finalised. However, following recent consultation with the EU Commission, agreement was reached whereby, in addition to issuing balancing payments to those farmers whose applications are fully processed and whose maps are fully digitised, payments will also issue to those farmers where some or all of their maps are still to be digitised, with the payment being calculated on the basis of the digitised land confirmed otherwise eligible.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to say that, because of this change, many farmers, including the person named, whose balancing payments would otherwise have been delayed until their digitising is complete, have now received an interim balancing payment; in the case of the person named, the interim balancing payment issued on 1 December.  These farmers, including the person named, will receive the final instalment of their balancing payment when their maps are re-digitised and their applications are fully clear.</P>

        <P>Balancing payments under the scheme, would, in normal circumstances, be confined to those whose applications are fully processed, specifically, where all digitising is finalised. However, following recent consultation with the EU Commission, agreement was reached whereby, in addition to issuing balancing payments to those farmers whose applications are fully processed and whose maps are fully digitised, payments will also issue to those farmers where some or all of their maps are still to be digitised, with the payment being calculated on the basis of the digitised land confirmed otherwise eligible.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to say that, because of this change, many farmers, including the person named, whose balancing payments would otherwise have been delayed until their digitising is complete, have now received an interim balancing payment; in the case of the person named, the interim balancing payment issued on 1 December.  These farmers, including the person named, will receive the final instalment of their balancing payment when their maps are re-digitised and their applications are fully clear.  The REPS application of the person named will be processed further immediately as the necessary digitising is completed.</P>

        <Quest> the actions taken by him in 2009 and 2010 under the decentralisation programme and their estimated cost; the actions intended under this programme in 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the original Government decision on the decentralisation of my Department was that 600 headquarter posts would move to Portlaoise; some 100 posts in the local offices in Cork city would move to Fermoy; and up to 100 posts in the laboratories in Cork and Limerick would move to Macroom.  The Government announced, in 2008, that the moves of my Department&rsquo;s offices to Fermoy and Macroom had been deferred pending a review in 2011. </P>
        <P>The Fisheries function was transferred to my Department in 2007 and the administrative staff of the fisheries area, comprising some 85 posts, were decentralised to Clonakilty.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s original Decentralisation Implementation Plan allowed for a phased move to Portlaoise, so as to minimise risk, aid continuity of business and maintenance of service delivery to stakeholders.  Since the programme began there has been an increase in Portlaoise of some 300 posts bringing the total there to almost 500 posts.</P>
        <P>Regarding costs of decentralistion, the Department sends a quarterly return to the Decentralisation Implementation Group, which details the non-property costs such as travel.  To the end of Quarter 2, April to June 2010, these costs amounted to &euro;609,843 since the programme began.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works (OPW) deals with matters relating to the procurement of property and the associated costs.  The purchase of a site for the Department&rsquo;s offices in Portlaoise was completed in 2007 and the OPW subsequently announced a preferred tender as part of a <Col N="253"/>PPP (including other Government offices in Mullingar and Carlow).  In the context of the last budget, the Minister for Finance decided that the PPP would not go ahead but that the Department&rsquo;s building in Portlaoise would proceed &lsquo;on a traditional procurement basis&rsquo; and this is now being considered by the OPW.</P>
        <P>Work on progressing this programme further in 2011 will take account of the evolving operating environment and will have regard to the moratorium on staff numbers and the National Recovery Plan.</P>

	<P>The herd-number previously held in the sole name of the person named was transferred into the joint names of the person named and another person on 20 February 2010. To qualify for payment under the Single Payment Scheme, the Single Payment entitlements should also be transferred from the sole name of the person named into joint names. </P>
        <P>My Department issued letters on 14 April 2010 to the parties concerned that outlined the need to transfer the Single Payment entitlements and indicated that no payment could issue until the transfer of entitlements was completed. A Transfer of Entitlements form was enclosed. To date no reply has been received from the parties concerned and consequently no payment has issued.</P>
        <P>An application under the 2010 Single Payment Scheme was received from the person named on 11 May 2010. The application form was signed by the person named only. As the herdnumber was in joint names at the time of application, the application form needed to be signed by each of the joint herd-owners.

The 75% advance payment under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the 50% advance payment under the Single Payment Scheme, which issued on 21 September and 18 October 2010 respectively, were on the basis of the land cleared at that stage, as a number of parcels declared required digitising. </P>
        <P>Balancing payments under the scheme, would, in normal circumstances, be confined to those whose applications are fully processed, specifically, where all digitising is finalised. However, following recent consultation with the EU Commission, agreement was reached whereby, in addition to issuing balancing payments to those farmers whose applications are fully processed and whose maps are fully digitised, payments will also issue to those farmers where some or all of their maps are still to be digitised, with the payment being calculated on the basis of the digitised land confirmed otherwise eligible.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to say that, because of this change, many farmers, including the person named, whose balancing payments would otherwise have been delayed until their digitising is complete, have now received an interim balancing payment; in the case of the person named, the interim balancing payment issued on 1 December.</P>
        <P>These farmers, including the person named, will receive the final instalment of their balancing payment when their maps are re-digitised and their applications are fully clear.</P>

	<P>Under the provisions of the governing EU Regulations, payments under the Single Farm Payment may be made only in respect of eligible land and applicants under the Scheme are obliged annually to declare to my Department the land parcels available to them. Details of the eligible area of the land parcels are recorded on my Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). It is also necessary for applicants to exclude ineligible features such as scrub, roadways, etc. Therefore, the LPIS database has to be amended on an ongoing basis to reflect any permanent changes such as parcel boundary changes, addition of new parcels, etc. In the vast majority of cases, applicants make sufficient deductions for the ineligible features.</P>
        <P>The person named was found to have claimed fully on parcels which contained buildings. As buildings are ineligible under the Scheme, the person named was found to have been over-paid and he was advised accordingly, in writing. These over-payment amounts were fully recouped from the payments due to the person named under both the 2010 Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Area Scheme.</P>

        <Quest> the length of time it now takes for a person to have his or her case heard by the Employment Appeals Tribunal from the date the person lodged his or her claim with the tribunal. </Quest>

	<P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal is one of the front-line services directly affected by the downturn in the economy.  There has been an unprecedented level of increase in claims being submitted to the Tribunal &mdash; from 3,173 in 2007 to 9,458 in 2009.  This trend has continued in 2010 with approximately 8,571 new claims lodged between January and the end of November. This level of increase has had an impact on case processing timeframes.  </P>
        <P>I am informed, from information provided by the Tribunal Secretariat, that the longest recorded waiting periods at the end of November for a hearing of the Tribunal ranged from 52 weeks to 77 weeks. In the case of hearings concerning redundancy claims, the range was between 23.5 weeks and 63.5 weeks.</P>
        <P>Efficiencies introduced have increased the Tribunal&rsquo;s output, with 5,698 claims processed between January and the end of November this year, which compares with 2,807 claims processed for the whole of 2007. A business process review is being conducted of all administrative processes within the Tribunal to find further efficiencies, and the Tribunal is participating with other employment rights and industrial relations Bodies in to identify any further procedural and administrative measures that might be implemented to ensure better and more appropriate use of services. That review will be completed shortly. Once it is completed, arrangements will be put in train to put a new IT system in place for the Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The Tribunal is taking further measures in order to address the upward pressure on case processing timeframes. These include increasing the number of hearings per day, and increasing the average number of cases being heard at each sitting.</P>
        <P>I hope to make additional staff resources available to the Tribunal within the next few weeks with a view to enabling it, in particular, to increase the number of Hearings in Dublin, where the greatest backlog now exists, and also to establish a specialist Division for the hearing of redundancy related cases. In a recent pilot project in Cork, the temporary deployment of an extra Division there with a special focus on redundancy-related cases, allowed the waiting-time for such cases to be reduced from 44.5 weeks to 19.5 weeks.</P>

	<P>The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place to support and grow our <Col N="265"/>enterprise base in order to facilitate job creation. The State Development agencies under the aegis of my Department &mdash; Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, are continuing to drive and promote enterprise development, and consequently employment creation in our economy.</P>
        <P>Budget 2011 saw &euro;508 million in capital spending alone dedicated to driving Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth through increased exports, more foreign direct investments and the smart economy by significantly investing in research and development.</P>
        <P>This multi-billion capital investment in growth and jobs is routed through my Department and its agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the County and City Enterprise Boards.  This investment and other measures outlined in the National Receovery Plan will support the acheivement of the targets set out in the Government&rsquo;s Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy strategy, including the target to create 300,000 new direct and indirect jobs in the enterprise and tourism sectors by 2015.</P>
        <P>It will deliver nearly 30,000 new jobs in 2011, including both direct and indirect jobs, just from the IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland client base alone.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland will support the achievement of these job creation targets through a number of key interventions such as:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />support for start-ups, R&amp;D and Innovation, and securing exports.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Supporting the establishment and growth of High Potential Start-Ups.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />supporting companies to target new opportunities in overseas markets.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />continuing to be focused on supporting company investments</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />continuing to invest in R&amp;D both in terms of in-company investments, and by supporting the commercialisation of Ireland&rsquo;s research.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A vibrant and growing Foreign Direct Investment sector remains central to an economic recovery based on export led growth and the development of the Smart Economy.  Earlier this year, IDA launched its strategy &ldquo;<i>Horizon 2020&rdquo;, </i>  which set out the Agency&rsquo;s targets for the period 2010 to 2014.  To date in 2010, there have been 75 announcements in relation to job creation by IDA client companies with the potential to create over 5,000 jobs.</P>
        <P>To support these targets, the IDA has established a new High Growth Markets Team to achieve 20% of Greenfield investments into Ireland by 2014 originating from these markets, with a further team targeting new High Growth companies.  Additionally, IDA has developed a suite of support mechanisms to assist companies, which will form the basis of the agency&rsquo;s ongoing interaction with its client companies at both local and corporate level.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  </P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department received two statutory redundancy lump sum claims in respect of the individual concerned on 28 October and 27 November 2009, one from a Liquidator and one from a Receiver.  An application for minimum notice pay was also received in respect of the same individual.</P>
        <P>I understand that in this case, the Liquidator mistakenly submitted the first application for payment of statutory redundancy for the person mentioned.  The person had not left employ<Col N="267"/>ment but was retained in employment in a transfer of undertaking situation.  The Receiver is running the business as a going concern. However, the Receiver subsequently made the person redundant and submitted the second redundancy claim in November 2009.</P>
        <P>Where there is a change in ownership of a business but the employee, by arrangement, continues to work for the new owner with no break in employment, the employee is not entitled to redundancy payment at the time of change of ownership.  Continuity of employment is preserved with the new employer who can of course subsequently make the employee redundant at a future date.</P>
        <P>In relation to the redundancy claim submitted by the Receiver, to date, no Deed of Appointment has been received by my Department from the Receiver as required, nor has any Statement of Affairs been provided as is required to facilitate both payment of statutory redundancy and minimum notice entitlements under insolvency legislation.</P>
        <P>The Receiver has been asked to submit a copy of the Deed of Appointment and to provide a Statement of Affairs in relation to the business, which is being run as a going concern.  Payment cannot be effected by my Department until these documents have been submitted and are in order.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Combating poverty and building an inclusive society are key priorities for the Government. The overall goal of the <i>National Action Plan for Social Inclusion,</i> published in 2007, is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty in the population to between 2% and 4% by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. The plan prioritises 12 high level goals in relation to children, people of working age, older people, people with disabilities and communities. It identifies some 150 actions across Departments and agencies with a remit in social <Col N="268"/>policy, as part of a strategic approach to make a decisive impact on poverty over the period to 2016. </P>
        <P>CSO data from the annual<i> Survey on Income and Living Conditions </i>(SILC)<i> </i>  shows that in 2008 the consistent poverty rate was 4.2%, having fallen from 5.1% in 2007 and 8.2% in 2003.</P>
        <P>The report on the implementation of the National Action Plan to the end of 2008 shows a similar pattern of progress in the actions of Departments to achieve the goals in the plan.  This involved significant State investment in education, employment and training for lone parents and for people with disabilities; in health and community care for older people; in local and community development; and in integration initiatives for migrants.</P>
        <P>The CSO figures for 2009, published on 25 November last, highlight the continuing importance of social transfers as a stabiliser for people in difficult economic circumstances. In 2009, social transfers reduced the &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate from 46% to 14.1%. This is a &lsquo;poverty reduction effect&rsquo; of 70%.</P>
        <P>The rise in consistent poverty to 5.5% indicated in the 2009 figures is a cause for concern and reflects the increase in unemployment. In meeting the challenges that face us in the immediate years ahead, the Government is committed to prioritising those who are the most vulnerable and to protect as far as possible the frontline services in marginalised communities. The overriding objective now is to restore economic growth and maximise employment so that the recent progress made in tackling poverty can be continued and the goals in the National Action Plan for an inclusive and fair society can be achieved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 351 and 358 together.</P>
        <P>As has been previously outlined to the Deputy, the majority of expenditure allocated to community groups through my Department for drugs initiatives is channelled through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces.  Under this process, applications for funding are made directly to the Task Forces.</P>
        <P>In 2010, in excess of &euro;31 million in current funding has been made available to fund the activities of the Task Forces, of which &euro;21.045 million was allocated to the Local Drugs Task Forces and &euro;10 million to the Regional Drugs Task Forces.  This funding will support some 500 initiatives that the Task Forces have prioritised for investment in their respective areas.  In addition, I recently approved funding of nearly &euro;500,000 for small-scale capital projects in the Task Force areas.</P>
        <P>Funding in relation to drug initiatives in Co. Kildare is made through the South Western Regional Drug Task Force (SWRDTF).  The SWRDTF covers South Dublin, West Wicklow <Col N="269"/>and Kildare and was allocated &euro;894,750 in 2010.  In addition to this, almost &euro;17,000 was provided to fund 3 projects under the Small Capital Premises Fund in County Kildare.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 366 to 373 inclusive, together</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, in the current economic circumstances, we are faced with difficult decisions. The Government has considered a number of measures in the context of the National Recovery Plan 2011-14 to provide the basis for a sustainable approach to the current financial situation.  Across Government, our approach has been to do this in as balanced a way as possible.</P>
        <P>Taking into account the recent Supplementary Estimate and the full year funding associated with functions transferred into and out of the Department during 2010, gross funding for my Department is reduced by a total of 13% in 2011 &mdash; current by 6% and capital by 28%.</P>
        <P>Within this context, my primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the daily front-line services provided with funding from my Department are protected, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities.</P>
        <P>In our current financial circumstances, it is clear that objectives will have to be pursued with less resources than previously. However, we will continue to strive to achieve good outcomes and value for money notwithstanding these constraints. Every saving that can be made from cutting back on overheads will be pursued so that the urban, rural, Gaeltacht and island communities we serve retain, to the greatest extent possible, the services that have been developed in partnership with them over the years.</P>
        <P>Details as to the manner in which the funding will be allocated between various programmes will be published in due course in the Revised Estimates Volume.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 380 and 383 together. </P>
        <P>In common with all areas of the public service, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces will operate with reduced funding for 2011. The gross allocation for Defence and Army Pensions combined in 2011 is &euro;933m, an overall reduction of 4% on the 2010 allocation. Defence spending at &euro;725m, including capital spending, will be down by &euro;30m or 4% on the 2010 Estimate. The provision for Army Pensions (Vote 37) for 2011 is &euro;208m, which is a non-discretionary expenditure.</P>
        <P>There has been a reduction in participation in overseas peacekeeping in 2010, particularly the withdrawal from Chad and the reduction in numbers serving in Kosovo and Bosnia-<Col N="275"/>Herzegovina. Ireland, however, remains open to participation in peacekeeping operations with such participation reflecting the reduced budgetary resources. The cost of overseas allowances in a given year is principally a factor of the number of personnel serving overseas and the time spent overseas.  The Defence Forces retain the capacity to deploy overseas.  With regard to future deployments of Defence Forces personnel to overseas missions, a number of options have been under consideration by civil and military management. I would hope to be in a position to bring forward recommendations to Government as appropriate in the near future.</P>
        <P>Administrative efficiencies of &euro;3m in 2011 will be achieved chiefly through reduced personnel numbers and related costs, in addition to reduced expenditure on telecommunications services. The full year yield of &euro;21m on administrative efficiencies relates primarily to payroll savings across the Vote that will accumulate by 2014.</P>

	<P>It is anticipated that there will be a reduction of up to 40 civilian employee positions during 2011, primarily through natural wastage. It is estimated that savings amounting to &euro;700,000 will accrue next year as a result of the non-replacement of these employees. Civilian Employees are based at various military installations in every Brigade area. </P>

	<P>The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, like all areas of the public service, will operate on a reduced budget in 2011. The gross allocation in 2011 for Defence and Army Pensions combined is &euro;933m, an overall reduction of 4% on the 2010 allocation.  Investment in new equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces is normally provided for under various Subheads of the Defence Vote relating to defensive equipment, mechanical transport, aircraft, Naval Service ships and stores, property, building and engineering, communications and Information Technology equipment. Each of these Subheads will operate with a reduced allocation in 2011. The exception is the Naval Service Subhead, the allocation for which in 2011 includes continuation of payment for the new ships contract. </P>
        <P>The Department is engaged on an ongoing capital building programme designed to modernise and enhance the training, operational and accommodation facilities available to members of the Defence Forces. The programme provides for new starts and the continuation of capital building projects already underway. No projects will be cancelled as a result of the reduced <Col N="276"/>capital allocation in 2011. However the capital programme will be revised to reflect available funding.</P>
        <P>The specifics in relation to equipment acquisitions that will be deferred or postponed will be the subject of review with the military authorities in January 2011.</P>
        <P>The steady investment since 2000 means that the Defence Forces are well placed in addressing the challenges for 2011 and the adjustments required under the National Recovery Plan. The priority in the coming year will be on maintaining the capability of the Defence Forces to deliver effective services across all of the roles assigned by Government.</P>
