	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
        <P>The Government decided in July 2008 that a census of population will take place in 2011, as required by EU regulation, and asked the CSO to commence the necessary preparations.  A public consultation was conducted in September 2008.  The CSO placed a notice in the national press inviting views on the topics to be covered and on the outputs to be produced.  There was <Col N="2"/>also direct engagement with all Departments.  More than 90 submissions were received, covering 31 topics in total.</P>
        <P>A census advisory group was established by the CSO in autumn 2008 to consider the submissions received and advise on the questions to be tested in a pilot survey planned for April 2009.  This group consisted of representatives of central and local government, the social partners, universities, research bodies and other users of census data, along with the relevant CSO personnel.  The work of the group was also informed by the core topics that must be covered by all member states under the relevant EU regulation.</P>
        <P>A specific sub-group was convened to consider the appropriate treatment of disability-related issues.  This was composed of representatives from the National Disability Authority, the Equality Authority, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies.  One of the key issues it considered was a proposal to list specific disabilities, including autistic spectrum disorder, on the census questionnaire.  The sub-group concluded that it would not be appropriate, nor would there be enough room on the census form, to list individual disabilities.  It did, however, agree that the existing 2006 category, &ldquo;A learning or intellectual disability&rdquo;, should be split into two categories: &ldquo;An intellectual disability&rdquo;; and separately &ldquo;A difficulty with learning, remembering or concentrating&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The pilot survey was held on Sunday, 19 April 2009.  Its main purpose was to test public reaction to the wording of a number of new questions, including successful testing of the revised approach to the questions on disability.  The sample consisted of 11,400 households, covering 32 enumeration areas spread throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In December the Government agreed on the list of topics to be included in the next census questionnaire in line with the advice of the CSO and the census advisory group.  This list of topics is available on the CSO website, along with the report of the census pilot survey conducted in April last.  The Government also agreed that census day will be Sunday, 10 April 2011.</P>
        <P>Greater use of statistical information to underpin evidence-based policies is a key goal across all areas of public service delivery.  It is a matter for each Minister and Department to prioritise their data needs in this regard, building on the core demographic information established by the national census of population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The last part of the reply is very interesting.  Everybody was consulted about the content of the census form bar the Members of this House.  A number of people in this House have had a great deal of involvement and experience in dealing with, particularly, children with autism.  To send out a survey to the members of the public asking them whether particular illnesses should be designated for special mention on a form is quite ridiculous.  The only people concerned about real issues like this are the parents and organisations dealing on a daily basis with unfortunate children who have a disorder such as autistic spectrum disorder.  I fail to see how any Government can develop a proper policy particularly in the area of education and health without statistics about the numbers of people affected, in this instance, by autism.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State aware of ongoing difficulty for parents trying to get proper educational facilities, speech therapy and medical assistance for children with autism, be it at early diagnosis stage or in primary and secondary education and ultimately right through the educational system?  I ask the Minister of State to take the matter back to Government and ask whether it would not be better off being discussed by the appropriate committee in this House that could invite the various organisations dealing with specialist illness such as autism to make submissions outlining what they want.  They are the people with whom we are dealing on a daily basis.  Everybody else was consulted on the content of the form.  To say that this <Col N="3"/>specialist group ruled it out on the basis that the form was not big enough is the best I have heard.  Surely a form can be made somewhat bigger to include important questions such as the one I pose here.  Will the Minister of State review this matter again?  As Minister of State in the Department of the Taoiseach and Chief Whip he has responsibility for the CSO.  If he gives a direction in this regard, it will be done, and I ask him to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Barrett for his question.  When I took over this responsibility a year and a half ago, one of the first matters that came to my attention, through a constituent of the Deputy, was the issue of autism.  I took the trouble to raise it directly with the CSO.  I went to the CSO office in Cork, just to tease out the issue.  The reply I have given is substantially what the specialist compiling the data gave us.  Unfortunately, it will not be possible at this stage to change matters because the order for the date of the census has already been set.  Issues such as the contract for printing the census forms and so on are in place.  I certainly will take on board what the Deputy is saying, however.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To be fair, the various voluntary bodies and statutory agencies that deal with the whole area of disability, particularly autism, were consulted.  A pilot questionnaire was issued which contained two versions of the disability question.  These were submitted to alternate households during the pilot survey.  The analysis from the pilot survey indicated that the best information would be compiled by using version A of the questionnaire.  That arises from the way the question on disability was framed in the 2006 census, incidentally, so there is a development, while admittedly not to everyone&rsquo;s satisfaction, in the type of information being elicited on disability at each stage.</P>
        <P>It would not be appropriate nor would there be enough room, the sub-group concluded.  I happen to believe the &ldquo;enough room&rdquo; reference was somewhat weak.  However, it agreed that the existing 2006 category, as regards a learning or intellectual disability, should be split into two.  The revised approach to the question of disability was tested successfully in the 2009 pilot survey and the reworded questions, which may be found on the website, include questions as to whether a person has any long-lasting conditions or difficulties such as blindness or serious vision impairment.  There is a very long list which includes difficulties doing activities as well as questions on general health, means of travelling from home including the time a person leaves for work, school or college, the time taken for the journey, data about unpaid personal help and so on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I now have the specific information to hand and category (a) was in relation to blindness and (b) deafness or serious hearing impairment; &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Category (c) refers to a difficulty with basic physical activities such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting or carrying and (d) to an intellectual disability.  Category (e) refers to a difficulty with learning, remembering or concentrating, (f) a psychological or emotional condition and (g) a difficulty with pain, breathing or any other chronic illness or condition.   &ldquo;If &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; to any of the categories specified in question 14, do you have any difficulty in doing any of the following?: (a) dressing, bathing or getting around inside the home; (b) going outside the home alone to shop or visit a doctor&rsquo;s surgery; (c) working at a job or business, or attending school or college; (d) participating in other activities, for example, leisure or using transport.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Those are the alternatives that were tested in the pilot survey.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of these questions suggest that it is a matter of curiosity as distinct from developing actual facts in order to develop policy.  Whether it is autism or any other form of disability, it is important from the viewpoints of education and health that we should have proper and accurate statistics.  The only way to get them is from the census.  It is quite absurd that everybody was consulted bar those elected to this House.  We are directly <Col N="4"/>involved with various types of illness, including autism.  We have to deal with such issues daily, but we cannot develop proper policies without having accurate statistics.  Will the Minister of State please make inquiries in this regard?  I tabled a similar question a couple of years ago, so I gave plenty of notice.  I am not doing this from curiosity, but because I was asked to do so by people who are dealing with autistic children.  They feel it is necessary to get accurate statistics to develop a proper framework in which to provide services for such children and in other areas also.  </P>
        <P>Another question refers to &ldquo;anybody with an intellectual disability&rdquo; and adds &ldquo;if so, please state the type&rdquo;.  It should then ask whether the person is satisfied that there are adequate education facilities.  Those are the sort of questions that should be posed.  The most serious issue of all is the lack of speech therapy for young children who are left with a disability as a result of not receiving such services early on.  I ask the Minister of State to re-examine this matter.  As public representatives we are depending on him to make our case to those involved in this issue.  Ultimately, it is the Minister of State&rsquo;s responsibility to say whether this goes in or stays out.  That is what governments are for and the Minister of State is in a positive position to be able to do something about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not go all the way with what Deputy Barrett is suggesting.  He should not forget that we have a fairly significant body of disability legislation, which was enacted by this House in recent years.  The national disability database together with other pieces of legislation, such as the EPSEN Act, have been progressively implemented.  They are the principal vehicles whereby the type of information the Deputy is talking about would be compiled.  </P>
        <P>As regards how questions for inclusion in the census form are chosen, all EU member states will be conducting censuses in 2011 in compliance with an EU regulation, which is the first covering censuses.  All member states have to cover a number of core questions and are also bound to produce their outputs according to standard methodology agreed at EU level.  If the Deputy has time to consult the website, he will see the core questions that have to be asked.  There are also other non-core questions, which each member state can frame in its own way.</P>
        <P>As regards the deficit of statistics on persons with autism, the Central Statistics Office suggests that it is simply not possible to collect statistics concerning specific disabilities on a census form.  Indeed, it is not realistic to collect information on specific individual disabilities on any household survey.  The range and enormously diverse nature of illness and disability are not suited to survey collection.  It is more appropriate to gather such data from administrative records.  That is constantly improving because one of the issues that arose when I met the officers in the Central Statistics Office was the matter of how else it could be done if it could not be done in the census.  The CSO publishes over 300 statistical releases and publications each year.  It provides high quality statistical information which is a vital input to planning for the future and monitoring outcomes at national, regional and local levels.  The CSO has, for some time, promoted greater use of objective statistical information in evidence-based policy making across all areas of public services, including those relating to intellectual disability.  In this regard, it is a matter for each Department to set out and prioritise its own statistical data needs.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Barrett, because there is merit in the idea, I will arrange for the CSO officials responsible for the census to meet the appropriate committee as soon as possible so that some of the concerns the Deputy and other Members have raised can be dealt with.  Their concerns are not without value, but there is no point in suggesting the next census can be <Col N="5"/>revisited.  In the meantime we could consider how we can get more specific data and how we can prepare for the following census.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister of State indicate to what extent public advertisement was employed by the Central Statistics Office in announcing the public consultation process on the construction of the census documents in advance of next year&rsquo;s census, which he has indicated will take place on 10 April 2011?  How extensive was that trawl and what was the extent of the response?  Was the HSE invited to offer its opinion, particularly with regard to the pilot census document?  I have one of those documents but I think the Minister of State indicated there were two.  Will he clarify whether two different types of forms were employed in the pilot census in 2009 or the pilot data collection process undertaken?</P>
        <P>In the document I have, it has blindness, deafness or severe vision or hearing impairment down as one question whereas the document to which the Minister of State referred had separate questions.  I suggest the form to which he referred is eminently more sensible than one where the information is all together because it is difficult to understand how one can inform the Government and policy makers of the critical need by placing blindness and deafness in the one category.</P>
        <P>We have had a health section in the pilot survey of 2009.  Can we, therefore, look forward to a more elaborate health section intended to gather an even greater amount of information in the 2011 census form?  Has the CSO considered the possibility of including questions on more specific and more widespread conditions such as diabetes and asthma?  Would it not be a worthwhile exercise to inform policy makers of the extent or prevalence of diabetes and asthma in society and is this not the ideal way to establish the full facts about these prevalent conditions in society?  Can the Minister of State indicate whether the HSE has been involved in the consultation process?  If so, what was the result of that consultation and what was the result of any other consultation with regard to the health area?  Does the Minister of State accept that more specific questions regarding health would be useful in helping to determine health care needs and planning required in terms of health care systems and supports?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The consultation took place between August 2008 and November 2008.  Submissions were invited from the public and interested bodies in August 2008 on the content of the questionnaire.  Submissions were received from 91 different organisations and individuals.  These covered Departments, local authorities, Government agencies, the research and academic communities and private individuals.  The submission covered 31 different topics.  I am not in a position to identify the position on the HSE specifically but I will find out the information and communicate it to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Two meetings of the census advisory group were held in September and November 2008.  The group comprised persons from Departments, local authorities, public bodies, the social partners, universities, research institutes and the CSO.  Some groups, comprising representatives from various appropriate bodies and interest groups, were convened to discuss and agree on the topics of disability, education, enumerating and homelessness.  The content of the pilot questionnaire was decided on the basis of the consultation and discussions that took place.  A strategic decision was taken at senior management level in the CSO to adhere to the 24-page layout used in the 2002 and 2006 censuses.  This provided three pages per person enumerated for up to six persons in each household.</P>
        <P>Two versions of the pilot questionnaire were devised to allow controlled testing of the new and revised questions, as indicated.  The two versions were distributed evenly among households in the pilot areas.  Version A was delivered to every second household and version B was offered to the remaining households.  The pilot survey was conducted on 19 April 2009 and the <Col N="6"/>sample covered approximately 11,400 addresses located in 32 enumeration areas in eight counties.  The areas selected were representative of urban and rural areas, in addition to deprived and non-deprived areas.</P>
        <P>Five types of strata were chosen for the pilot programme.  In cities, the enumeration areas were within Dublin and Cork administrative areas.  With regard to suburban areas, the enumeration areas were in the suburbs of Dublin.  The enumeration areas in large towns were in those with a population of 10,000 or more according to the 2006 census.  In areas with an urban-rural mix, the enumeration areas covered both urban and rural areas.  With regard to the rural stratum, all enumeration areas with at least 75% of their populations living in those rural areas were chosen.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about the inclusion of conditions such as diabetes.  I suspect the same response would be forthcoming from the CSO in this regard.  The census is not the appropriate mechanism for compiling such specific data.  I will arrange for the CSO officials involved with the census to explain how they managed to include or exclude certain questions.  Thus, we will have a better understanding of whether the other surveys the CSO is constantly carrying out on a rolling basis could be used to compile the very specific information Members of this House clearly find useful and important.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The expectation of the response indicated by the Minister of State should not dissuade us from forwarding a very sound case for the inclusion of specific questions that could help inform not only Deputies and Senators but also, and most important, wider society.  I instanced diabetes and asthma.  Surely the information gleaned thereon would inform the health authorities, including the HSE and Department of Health and Children.  Does the Minister of State agree?  The information might also inform people within the pharmaceutical sector on specific needs.  One could add a number of other conditions that are very much in evidence in Irish society, including coeliac disease, with a view to identifying the particular dietary needs of the people, in respect of which there is no proper presentation or marketing.  People have insufficient information on such conditions until such time as they become acutely aware of them.  There is a range of other questions that could inform a raft of different interests and areas in a cross-societal response to these particular needs.  I strongly encourage an exploration of what is possible for inclusion in the 2011 census.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s indication that he will check if the HSE was directly consulted.  If any consultation took place, what was its outcome?  Are there elements of the questions in the 2011 census that will get the information I am seeking?</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has requested and revert to him as quickly as I possibly can.  The CSO&rsquo;s thinking was strongly examined, evaluated and its advice was taken in the end.</P>
        <P>In an operation of the size and scale of the census, it is important to bear in mind that only questions that have been tested in the field, have proved to have worked and were acceptable to householders can be considered for inclusion in the 2011 census.  Anyone involved in any research testing will know that if there is any ambiguity regarding the likely outcome of a particular question, it is better to discard it.  The census form is delivered to every household in the State and every person in the State is required by law to answer the questions on the form.  The questions on disability that have been tested in the field are the 2006 variant of the question and the new 2011 variant.  It is not possible to include a question that has not been tested first.  Some questions, depending on the words used, the way the question is worded and the categories included, etc., do not work or give reasonable results.</P><Col N="7"/>
        <P>In this regard, the CSO feels the 2011 version of the question is a considerable improvement on the question asked in 2006 and has recommended it for inclusion.  The Government does not believe it would be appropriate to reject the advice of the CSO and the census advisory group in this regard.  There is little point in my view in raising expectations as to what can be achieved, particularly in light of the professional advice the Government has received.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of unoccupied dwellings will be a significant feature of the next census.  We will need to know precisely the number of unoccupied dwellings in the State.  Having had a quick look at the form, I note it states that it will be a census of people and households.  Will a count be taken of every dwelling that is unoccupied?  Anyone canvassing in the last election knows that the one great feature of our communities is the high number of unoccupied dwellings, even in well-established housing estates.  This will need to be factored into deciding economic and social policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is certainly anecdotal evidence that it is proving extremely difficult to compile census data from, for example, gated communities and others.  Anything up to a half dozen attempts would have been made in the previous census by enumerators to collect census forms.  A substantial majority of the forms were ultimately collected and the information collated.  I will find out for the Deputy the estimate for non-returned forms in the last census.  I do not believe it will be possible using the 2011 census to establish the level of unoccupied dwellings in the State.  It may, however, be possible by matching other data.  Matching the &euro;200 levy on second homes with local authority returns might for example be a way of getting some of the information required.  Some mechanism of establishing the extent of unoccupied dwellings in the State will have to be found, be it through organisations such as the universities, the Economic and Social Research Institute, Central Statistics Office or Revenue Commissioners.  While everybody is required by law to participate in the census, I will try to establish the level of participation in the last census and will forward the information to the Deputy.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be helpful.  However, I believe the Government needs to take a more structured proactive approach to this.  We need to know how many empty dwellings there are in the country.  Clearly, we have a surfeit and it would be immensely valuable if we knew the extent of that surfeit.  For the Minister of State to simply say that he will try to establish the number of non-returnable forms is to not get the nub of the issue.  Is it part and parcel of the project that an assessment is made of the number of dwellings that are unoccupied and that all the resources available are used to track under-occupancy across the country?  I do not know whether it is possible under data protection legislation to utilise information held by utility companies.  There is a big difference between an enumerator giving up and saying he or she cannot gain access to a particular area such as a gated community and one who, having gone through various procedures, reaches the conclusion that a building is unoccupied.  </P>
        <P>I suggest that if we do not have this information we will be losing an opportunity to finally understand the extent of the problems that have arisen out of the building boom and where we are now.  It would be unfortunate if, following this whole process, a Minister is not in a position to provide this House with the number of unoccupied dwellings and spare capacity in the country and to set out where they are in terms of the regions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not be possible to compile that type of information in the proposed census survey.  The Deputy will have seen on the database, in terms of household characteristics, the type of categories of questions that must be answered.  The type of information required includes the type of accommodation, the year the house was built, the nature of occupancy of the household, rent paid, number of rooms, central heating, water supply, sewage facilities, number of cars and vans, PC ownership and Internet connectivity.  These are the <Col N="8"/>questions that are honed in on.  While most of them are covered by EU regulation others including the type of accommodation, whether the property is rented or purchased, whether it has central heating, the number of cars and vans, PC ownership and Internet connectivity are chosen by member states.  The specific information which Deputy McManus seeks to be sought is not covered in the already agreed questions for the 2011 census.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry to labour the point but I do not believe the Minister of State is accepting the argument as it is made.  I have no problem with the questions chosen for the 2011 census or with whether they are set down by the EU or chosen by member states.  All of that information is helpful.  However, at some point an enumerator gives up.  It would be immensely useful for local authorities, health services, social policy makers and us if an enumerator, having gone through a certain amount of effort, can reach the conclusion that 10% of dwellings in a particular county are unoccupied.  What happens otherwise?  Are the forms thrown out?  I am asking the Minister of State to again take up this matter with the CSO.  Will the Minister of State go back to the CSO and make the point that unlike many other countries in the EU, we had this massive building explosion and people are now emigrating?  All one must do is go into a well-established housing estate to see houses where the curtains are discreetly closed or the shutters are discreetly pulled over, and know that they are no longer occupied but, because they cannot sell the houses, they are not up for sale.  That is the common experience, quite apart from the big new estates that are three quarters empty.</P>
        <P>It is crazy for us to embark on such a sophisticated fact-finding mission and omit that piece of the jigsaw.  I acknowledge it is difficult, but all I ask the Minister of State to accept is that if it can be done &mdash; the work of enumerators is meticulous and forensic &mdash; we should have that kind of information brought in to ensure that we have some picture of Ireland today, including the surfeit of building stock that exists all over the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>It may well be possible in the analysis of the returns for that kind of information to be elicited.  It would be worthwhile.  However, I have already stated that the questions have been set and it is gone to the stage where the Government has taken a decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy McManus that it would be interesting, and probably essential, for us to find a way, but she mentioned that some of the utilities &mdash; it is entirely possible, if we go down the road of installing water meters in every household unit in the State &mdash; would provide a way of finding out how many are occupied.  The ESB, gas companies and the like could provide data.  However, at this stage, while it may well be desirable, it will not be feasible to put in such a question,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but in the analysis of the returns it just may be possible.  I will try to establish with the CSO if that is possible.</P>

        <Quest>  the method he plans to adopt to introduce post codes here; the reason he has rejected a global positioning system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>A smart economy requires that the underlying infrastructure supports enterprises based on knowledge and innovation.  For this, an ability to collate and assess data spatially is a prerequisite and postcodes can play a key role and can deliver economic and social benefits across the whole economy.</P>
        <P>Ireland is the only country in the EU that does not have such a postal code in place, but as the Deputy is aware, the Government has now approved the implementation of a postcode system as recommended by the National Postcode Project Board.</P>
        <P>This board, which comprised representatives from Departments, together with public and private sector organisations, was established to recommend the most technically appropriate postcode system for Ireland, design an implementation plan and assess the costs and benefits of postcodes.</P>
        <P>In the course of its deliberations, the board looked at a number of postcode models and technologies including postal sector models and a number of spatial and hybrid postcode models taking into account several factors including memorability, likely uptake by the public and ability to adapt to emerging technologies.  The model recommended, and since approved by Government, is an alpha-numeric, publicly available and accessible postal code model.</P>
        <P>Each postcode will have a geo-coordinate at its centre and consequently, would be compatible with global positioning or navigation systems, allowing integration with GPS and other global navigation satellite technologies.  Applications based on such systems become much more readily accessible to the public through the use of a postcode.</P>
        <P>In arriving at this model, the technical and economic consultants who assisted the board engaged in a series of stakeholder consultations.  These consultations revealed overwhelming support for the introduction of postcodes across public, private and voluntary sectors and identified that postcodes would not only deliver benefits for the postal sector, but assist in the delivery of public services and contribute to the development of a knowledge economy and the country&rsquo;s overall competitiveness.</P>
        <P>My officials and I are currently working to address the next steps in this project.  A competition will be launched shortly to select a body that will assist the Department in managing the delivery of a working postcodes system.  That delivery will be effected by way of a competitive tender process.  It is expected that postcodes will be assigned and in use by the end of 2011.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his answer, which is almost identical to the answer he gave in November.  The reason I tabled the question is because I believe the Minister is making a big mistake.  He is correct to suggest a geo-coordinates based system would allow some compatibility with a GPS, global positioning system, but the problem is the coordinates used would be in the middle of a district relevant to between 20 and 50 houses.  This was outlined in the Minister&rsquo;s report.  It will cost approximately &euro;15 million to implement a new postal code system in Ireland after all the work is done and the money spent.  I strongly support the idea but there are issues for a HSE ambulance, a courier or a postman that does not know <Col N="10"/>the area.  Is it not the case that the new post code system the Minister proposes to introduce will not bring the person with a letter or service directly to a person&rsquo;s door or address without having local knowledge of the area?  If this is the case, is it not a waste of money to introduce a post code system that merely slightly improves what is in place at present &mdash; which requires local knowledge for postal delivery &mdash; when there is an alternative available which can pinpoint a person&rsquo;s property accurately through a GPS based model and that is being introduced on a commercial basis anyway by the private sector?  Couriers are buying in and the HSE is examining such a system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I must be careful because within a week we will start a competitive process which should deliver quickly in terms of the exact system we introduce.  Given that it will be within a competitive process I must be careful not to skew the result one way or the other.  The case is not as set out by Deputy Coveney.  I agree with the Deputy that post codes are right for this country and that as well as providing an effective postal code system they should have capability to provide location code facilities for a range of applications that will develop as the smart economy evolves.  I agree fully this must be one of the components within the system we develop and deliver.  However, the exact mechanism and format will depend on the competitive process.  I am not ruling out any one technology but we maintain it should fit within the characteristics set out as a result of the work done over the years in terms of having memorability, accessibility and the ability to evolve into a whole range of other uses which will bring benefits to our economy.  The competitive process will determine which technological solution will best provide this.  The solution will have to provide both location code services as well as a postal code service and I am committed to delivering this quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister and I agree that we must introduce a post code system.  However, the point on which the Minister and I disagree and where I believe he and the Government are making a big mistake is that the tendering process being introduced has only invited tenders according to criteria setting out an area based system.  He and others have already stated several times that the post code system would only pinpoint areas of the country on the basis of a code down to the nearest 20 to 50 properties.  If such a system were introduced to rural Ireland with the ability to narrow down to between 20 and 50 properties such a service would be no better than that which currently exists with the use of local districts or townlands.  This is the problem.  The tendering process the Minister intends to launch will not facilitate what is known as a one-to-one solution that will bring accuracy in terms of delivery.  The Minister may wish to correct me but my understanding is the reason the Minister decided on the model in question was based on one letter written in 2006 by the Data Protection Commissioner, Mr. Billy Hawkes, that outlines his view that there would be data protection issues with a post code system that pinpoints people&rsquo;s premises.  I fundamentally disagree with him on that.  There is much evidence to the contrary.  Will the Minister outline his reason for rejecting the accurate pinpointing of property in a new post code system based on GPS or some other accurate system for the area based coding which he is introducing?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not rejecting any accurate system.  It will be up to the competitive tendering process to decide on which system.  I have had several good conversations with the Data Protection Commissioner, who has the important job of protecting people from invasion of privacy.  That can be done while still delivering a system with the level of accuracy we need for locational code purposes and in the postal code system.  It must be done to the satisfaction of the Data Protection Commissioner and I believe it can be done.  It must also deliver a range of different services as well as the postal code service.  That is what we are seeking in the <Col N="11"/>tendering system, to deliver the best technical solution at the best cost while giving us the services we need.</P>

        <Quest> the budget set for 2010 to fund the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland; the budget for the period of its establishment in 2009; the cost to the authority of outsourcing work in 2010, 2011 and 2012; the way he will address the lack of public scrutiny in view of the scrutiny measures in the Broadcasting Act 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[3896/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, was established on 1 October 2009 under the Broadcasting Act 2009 as the new statutory body to regulate the broadcasting industry in Ireland.  The budget set by the authority&rsquo;s predecessor, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, for 2009 amounted to &euro;6.238 million.  That budget was prepared on the basis of a full year&rsquo;s operation although it was expected that the BAI would be established at some stage during that year.  The BCI was allocated &euro;4.575 million in Exchequer funding in respect of January to 30 September 2009.  Following its establishment on 1 October, the BAI continued to operate until 31 December within the limit of the original budget set by the BCI for 2009.</P>
        <P>As the BAI had not yet established the industry levy through which it is to be funded and as it had not yet established borrowing facilities which are provided for under the legislation, it relied on a number of existing cash flow sources to ensure that the regulation of the broadcasting industry could be maintained during the last quarter of 2009.  As regards 2010 and later years, in accordance with section 37 of the Act, the setting of the budget for the BAI for any particular year is a matter for the authority.  While the legislation makes provision in section 37(1) for the Minister to be able to specify the form the estimates should take and any additional information as may be needed, it does not require the estimates to be submitted for specific ministerial approval.  The budget for 2010 has been set by the BAI at &euro;7.6 million, which will be fully funded by the industry levy as provided for in the Act.  Details of this budget have been submitted to my Department and I will be considering if additional information is required.</P>
        <P>In accordance with section 37(7) of the Act, this 2010 estimate of income and expenditure will be published shortly by the BAI on its website, with my consent and that of the Minister for Finance.  The BAI has indicated that the increase in the budget for 2010 over that the 2009 budget for the BCI is as a result of the increased role given by the Oireachtas to the BAI.  While the BAI has taken over the functions of the BCI and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, BCC, it has also been given a range of new functions additional to those held by its predecessors, mainly relating to public service broadcasting and the provision of digital broadcasting services.  The BAI has also indicated that the extent to which this budget is actually expended will depend on the level of activity of the organisation.  It has confirmed that it will discharge its functions in a cost effective manner and is conscious of not imposing an undue burden on the broadcasting sector.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">In this context, section 32(4) of the Broadcasting Act requires the authority to ensure that regulation by the authority and the statutory committees does not involve the imposition or maintenance of unnecessary administrative burdens.  In addition to including this provision in legislation, I have made clear to the authority the need to be particularly vigilant about keeping costs down in the current economic climate.  I understand that the authority has requested the <Col N="12"/>chief executive to continuously review its proposed expenditure throughout 2010 with the aim of reducing it where possible.  In accordance with section 33 of the Act, any surplus of levy income over expenditure in 2010 shall be offset against future levies or refunded, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Section 33 of the Act provides for the BAI to meet its expenses by means of a levy on public services broadcasters and broadcasting contractors.  The Act requires the BAI to make a levy order for the collection, payment and administration of a levy and for a levy order to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made.  The levy order for 2010 was laid before both Houses on 19 January 2010.</P>
        <P>With regard to the outsourcing of work, section 18 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that the authority may engage consultants or advisers as necessary in the performance of its functions.  The outsourcing of work is, therefore, an issue for the authority in accordance with the requirements of the Act.</P>
        <P>I do not accept that there is a lack of public scrutiny of the BAI.  The Broadcasting Act provides a range of measures to ensure appropriate public scrutiny.  Section 37(4) of the Act requires that the annual accounts for a particular year are to be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General not later than the end of March the following year and, in accordance with section 37(5) of the Act, are to be submitted to the Minister, along with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, for laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the end of June of that year.  Furthermore, the chief executive is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, and the chief executive and the chairpersons of the authority and its committees are accountable to the appropriate committees of the House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>In addition to the requirements on the provision of estimates of income and expenditure, there are also provisions requiring proper management of books and records relating to income and expenditure and for ministerial oversight and consent as to the form of accounts.  The BAI is also subject to the Department of Finance guidelines on corporate governance of State bodies which include a range of obligations in terms of reporting, accountability, risk management, internal audit and departmental oversight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister gives me the information on the additional cost of outsourcing work by the Broadcasting Authority.  This is a central issue.  Does the Minister not accept that it is absolutely outrageous for him to tell us now that the budget for 2010 will be &euro;7.6 million, even though throughout the debate on the legislation he tried to dampen our concerns about increased costs?  In the past the Exchequer has footed the bill for broadcasting regulation but now that the broadcasters must foot the bill the costs have gone out of control.  The figure for last year was &euro;6.2 million, but the figure for this year is &euro;7.6 million.  It is a new authority but it is very similar to the old one in many ways in terms of regulating broadcasting.  How can the Minister stand over such escalating costs?</P>
        <P>Will he also answer the question about the additional costs?  Staff have left during the transfer and work will have to be, and perhaps already is, outsourced.  How much will that add to the costs?  How much is included for it in the &euro;7.6 million?  What will the Minister ensure is published that is in line with the legislation passed by the House, in which the Minister agreed to ensure proper scrutiny of what the authority does, by everybody and particularly by broadcasters who have suffered a 25% to 30% reduction in their advertising revenue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that every organisation must be conscious of costs in these difficult times and keep budgets tight&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="13"/>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>They have exploded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and live within them.  The chairman and chief executive of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland are aware of that fact.  They are committed to examining every aspect of their business, ensuring that they pare the costs down to the bare minimum and that the final outcome in terms of expenditure could be below what has been estimated.  They will publish an initial estimate but they are committed to maintaining costs to the minimum at a difficult time, particularly for many broadcasters as advertising revenues fall.  The authority has additional functions.  It must undertake a body of work this year in particular, as it sets itself up and takes on a range of new roles.  That will involve certain outside consultants.  There will not be the major increase of staff which was originally sought to take on this work.  I believe the work can be done cost effectively.  The authority&rsquo;s work benefits the industry in the short, medium and long term in providing a fair and competitive environment in which all operators know they are dealt with effectively and well.  That, as well as being cost competitive, is a key requirement of the authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is still in denial; he has been in denial from the beginning of the debate on this issue.  The Minister knows that the way to organise efficiencies is to have one regulator to replace ComReg and the Broadcasting Authority.  We now have a broadcasting authority with a budget of &euro;7.6 million.  That is the reality.  Nothing else matters and nothing the Minister says in honeyed words about every effort being made changes that.  The budget is a burden borne by broadcasters who are currently in difficulty.  That is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility.</P>
        <P>There was a hidden cost in the last three months of last year.  How much is that cost and who will pay it?  The Exchequer stopped paying as soon as the new authority was established on 1 October.  Who has paid the bills since then?  How will they be met if they are based on borrowing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The budget for last year was &euro;6.238 million for the full year.  The BAI was only in operation for the last quarter.  The budget from April to September, therefore, was set at approximately &euro;4.550 million and the remaining budget of approximately &euro;1.5 million &mdash; the accounts have still to come in &mdash; was the estimated cost for that fourth quarter.  It was largely met from cash flow resources that the authority had at its disposal.  The approach that was always agreed on this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what that means.  The Minister must explain it because it does not make any sense.  Money comes in from the Exchequer.  The budget was &euro;6.238 million.  There is now a &euro;1.5 million shortfall and the Exchequer is not paying for it.  The BAI is in existence and has costs.  It is only a new body so how can it have cash flow?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was legislated that the new body would not be paid by direct Exchequer payment, and provision was made for that in the accounts for last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is paying for it then?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The interim payment was made through existing cash flow resources the authority had.  The levy was always due to be applied.  It will be paid quarterly, with the payment being applied to the previous quarter.  The first payment in the first quarter this year, therefore, is retrospective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is for last year.  I see.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="14"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That will apply for each quarter.  There is also the provision that where there is an underspend, that amount can be refunded to the industry to ensure it gets the benefit from savings that should, and I am sure will, accrue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The final figure, therefore, is &euro;7.6 million plus &euro;1.5 million.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the position regarding the progress made in securing commercial digital television services following ongoing negotiations between a consortium (details supplied), RTE and the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[3893/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Broadcasting Act, 2009 requires the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, an independent regulatory authority, to provide for the development of commercial digital terrestrial television services.</P>
        <P>On foot of this requirement, the BAI&rsquo;s predecessor, the BCI, launched a competition, which is still ongoing.  As the Deputy is aware, the highest placed consortium in the competition withdrew from the process last April.   Negotiations then commenced with the next placed bidder and this process is continuing.</P>
        <P>As I stated recently in response to a previous question on this issue, I am not prepared to speculate on the outcome of the commercial DTT process, which is a matter for the BAI and one in which I do not have a direct role.  Nor am I prepared to surmise on the ongoing negotiations between BAI, RTE and the OneVision consortium.  I have, however, made clear my views that I would like to see this process concluded as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has been saying that for six months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The conclusion of the process is essential to provide certainty for broadcasters, suppliers and the general public with regard to the development of commercial DTT services in Ireland.  More generally, it is my intention that analogue TV services will be switched off in late 2012.  This will ensure a valuable digital dividend and it underlines the need to implement a DTT service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the third or fourth time we have discussed this issue.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, will know that I and many others have real concern that we will not be able to make the 2012 deadline for analogue switch off, which will have significant consequences.  I understand &mdash; the Minister can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that the new BAI met to discuss the DTT issue yesterday.  There are ongoing negotiations between RTE and the OneVision consortium, which is now the proposed provider of commercial DTT services on the multiplexes which are there for that.  </P>
        <P>I asked the Minister, Deputy Ryan, a question several months ago and wish to ask it again.  Will he set a deadline for those negotiations to be finalised so we all know the status of DTT regarding RTE, which has responsibility for and is required to provide free-to-air DTT services which, I understand, will be called Saorview?  There are significant financial consequences for RTE because of the commitments which have to be made to put the infrastructure in place.  Should OneVision go the route of Boxer we will be left holding the baby.  The Minister will be responsible even though he seems to refuse to be part of the process at this stage.</P>
        <P>As the person responsible from a policy perspective, will the Minister set a deadline for RTE and OneVision to conclude their negotiations so we and the Minister, who is the policy maker <Col N="15"/>in this area, know where the country stands, in terms of the provision of commercial DTT which is a requirement for the provision of a viable free-to-air DTT service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already set deadlines.  There is a deadline within the legislation we recently enacted for the switch on of a free-to-air digital service in December 2011.  There is a deadline for us of 2012, which is when we will switch off our analogue system because the valuable spectrum we can then accrue for broadband and other purposes is of real importance to us.  That is a certain deadline&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not on course for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and I said to each of the parties directly and clearly that, come what may, that deadline will be met.  We will switch off our analogue services.  In terms of the ongoing commercial negotiations between OneVision and RTE, it is the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland which will ultimately set the deadlines on that process.  That, under the legislation, is what its authority is and it would be wrong for a Minister to step into the middle of a commercial negotiation process and start subverting the BAI&rsquo;s role in that regard.  I have given clear indications here and elsewhere to everyone involved that there is time urgency with this issue and that it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest, if we are in such negotiations, to conclude them quickly.  I will not step into the middle of commercial negotiations because that would be counterproductive and improper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not asking the Minister to step into the middle of the negotiations.  Will he accept that RTE has already spent some &euro;70 million putting DTT infrastructure in place, on the basis of having a commercial operator in place which would help to finance that infrastructure?  Would he also accept that he changed the broadcasting legislation, through an amendment, to change the deadline which was set for the provision of DTT services, the deadline for which was the end of last year because of the ongoing problems resulting from Boxer pulling out?</P>
        <P>This time last year Boxer pulled out and we now potentially have a crisis on our hands, should it turn out that RTE and OneVision cannot do the necessary deal.  If that should happen we are starting all over again.  The Minister has responsibility to ensure that we are on course and that there is a clear road map in place to deliver analogue switch off by the end of 2012.  Yet, all the Minister is willing to say at the moment is that at the end of 2012 analogue switch off will happen.  Is he now saying that he will put no deadline in place for the conclusion of negotiations between RTE and OneVision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2012 deadline is real and absolute.  It also gives any party involved a clear deadline to be able to effectively set up whatever alternative service comes out of this process.  We are clearly coming very close to the time lines where we have to act immediately.  A deadline is set for 2012 which would require all parties involved to make their minds up and make their commercial decisions quickly.  Come what may, that deadline will be met.  We will switch off our analogue services and, despite the difficulties and the slowness of the process, I am still confident we will have an alternative digital service to offer the Irish public.</P>

	<P>The possibility of using the mobile phone infrastructure to broadcast messages to the public in the event of an emergency has been considered by my Department.  Initial discussions with the industry indicate that this is not a simple task and that the infrastructure is not designed to broadcast short message service messages simultaneously to all users of the mobile phone network.  It is proposed to have further engagement with industry to explore these technical limitations and to examine the feasibility of how messages can be delivered to the public during emergencies using mobile phone infrastructure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister may see this as a slightly unusual question because it is quite general in terms of what it requests, but the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has responsibility for communications.  He will agree that the technical infrastructure now exists for the Government to provide a communications channel in the case of emergencies directly from Government and the emergency infrastructure which it controls to the public.  I come from a city which has been devastated by flooding in the past three or four months.  Elderly people woke up with floodwaters lapping against their mattresses in their houses and had to be pulled out of windows by relatives or rescued by the emergency services.  We can no longer allow a situation to occur whereby, when we have warning that floods are on the way, we do not use the technology which is available to warn people of what will happen.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to work with me, if necessary, or the industry to ensure the emergency services directly linked to Government have the capacity to use the mobile phone infrastructure currently in place in the country to contact people via their mobile phones in the case of emergency.  It should also require the private sector which owns the infrastructure to provide it to Government for use in the case of an emergency such as flooding or some other type of emergency so we can contact people.  For every 100 people in Ireland there are 117 mobile phones.  Practically every person or household has a mobile phone.  It is the obvious way to contact and alert people to warn them about emergencies.  Will the Minister put that type of system in place?  It is directly connected to his area of responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The emergency task force which was convened recently did exactly that.  It was related to the water issue, where there was a real crisis in terms of the loss of water due to people leaving taps running and so on.  It was on that basis the emergency task force went to the mobile phone companies and asked if it was possible for it to use the communications technology in that way.  There were difficulties, as is the case when 4.5 million or 5 million messages need to be sent, which have to be considered.  In that instance it was not used.  It was felt that radio and television broadcasting communications systems could deliver the message.  There may be other circumstances.  The one to which the Deputy referred is a good example of where it may be possible for us on an emergency service basis to provide instant messaging in such a way.  The Department is engaged and will liaise with the Deputy in that regard to see what specific measures will work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to be helpful because this is not an issue on which we should be political.  I have two proposals, both of which are highly credible, on how we can use the existing mobile phone mast infrastructure to alert people in regional specific areas.  Nobody is suggesting that if there is going to be significant flooding in Cork that 4 million people get a text message to say that a mini tsumani is coming down the River Lee from Inniscarra into Cork city.  What we are suggesting is that we should be sophisticated enough, because the technology exists, to be able to use the mobile telephone masts in the Cork city area to contact people who will be directly affected by, for example, floods.  If Bandon is going to be flooded on Tuesday, given that we have the data from the rivers that flow into that town and from the <Col N="17"/>weather forecast expertise, we should use the mobile telephone mast infrastructure in that area in west Cork to send a message to that specific region to let those concerned know what is going to happen and when it is likely to happen in order that businesses and homes can prepare for it.  It is inexcusable that we would not use the technology that is available to ensure that the kind of ill-prepared response to flood crises that happened in places such as Cork and elsewhere would not happen again and it certainly should not happen without warning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy.  As I have said those engagements have already started with the mobile telephone companies.  They will continue and will take into account the suggestion he has made.  It is more applicable in areas where there are short timelines in terms of a flood warning or other such emergency.  We will continue to progress the issue with the mobile telephone companies.  </P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> if the Commission for Energy Regulation is considering removing the regulated tariff formula pricing structure which allowed for competition in the gas market; his views on whether this will halt competition, choice and service in this sector for consumers and small medium enterprises; his further views on whether that regulated tariff formula is of more importance due to the current economic climate; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[3895/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulation of charges in the natural gas market, including tariffs to final customers, is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, under the Gas (Interim) Regulation Act 2002.</P>
        <P>The gas market has been fully opened up to competition since July 2007.  Experience in other markets has shown that there is a time lag between full market opening and the emergence of fully viable competition.  The small size of the Irish retail gas market adds to the challenge.</P>
        <P>The current regime of regulation in the upper end segment of the Industrial and Commercial sector is known as the Regulated Tariff Formula regime.  The Regulated Tariff Formula took effect in 2003 for gas customers consuming from 188,000 to 9 million therms per annum.  Prior to its introduction in April 2003, Regulated Tariff Formula eligible customers could choose from a range of Bord G&aacute;is Energy published tariffs.  The Regulated Tariff Formula regime introduced a price regulation formula reflective of monthly wholesale prices and the cost of delivering gas to the customer&rsquo;s premises.</P>
        <P>This regime was introduced as an interim measure in 2003 to encourage competition in this sector at a time when Bord G&aacute;is Energy Supply, BGES, had 100% of the market of this sector.  BGES now has approximately 41% of this sector.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the CER that it launched a review of the Regulated Tariff Formula last October.  This review is in line with the commitment by the CER that it would keep the case for retaining or removing the Regulated Tariff Formula regime under regular review.  The CER has indicated that it considers the time may now be right to remove the RTF regime.  The decision process involves a consultation process on the potential of the regime.  The consultation is ongoing.</P>
        <P>The continued entry of new suppliers into the gas market, with Phoenix and ESBIE being the most recent entrants, demonstrates that regulatory policy to underpin the growth of competition in gas supply has paid dividends for consumers.  The decision now to be made by CER following the consultation process is whether competition has now taken sufficient hold for the Regulated Tariff Formula to be removed in the interests of business customers.  I have no doubt <Col N="18"/>that in reaching a balanced and evidence based decision CER will take due account of all the perspectives on the matter including the views of all suppliers and of the business customers themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I asked whether it was his opinion that this is the wrong time to remove the Regulated Tariff Formula in view of the fact that competition is so vital in the economy.  I do not accept his claim that it is the responsibility of CER.  I can recall the Minister coming into this House during the past 12 months when he used considerable influence to reduce the price of natural gas which had declined on the wholesale market.  Also by his appointment of the new regulator, the Minister is, in effect, in charge of CER.  It is important to know what is his policy.  Does the Minister agree that the removal of RTF at that stage would not be beneficial for the consumer and small industries as there would no longer be a transparent pricing system for gas which could lead to a dominant position for Bord G&aacute;is which could stifle competition?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My direction is that we achieve a competitive clean and secure energy supply and keep money in this country rather than have it go abroad as much as possible.  In the gas area, the RTF applies for about 246 customers.  These are some of the larger industrial customers, companies that are in a competitive challenge, exporting companies to the UK and others.  For them it is important that the regulator gets the price right.  There are real benefits from introducing competition from having it deregulated in that one can have a downward price pressure for such customers.  However, it is not certain.  One has to ensure there is not a dominant position that one does not end up giving short-term gains and seeing a long-term loss.  It is the regulator&rsquo;s job to assess, to listen to different views and come to a conclusion.  I am confident in its ability to take on that task and to make the necessary change.  The RTF has been in place for a number of years.  It was always seen as being a temporary measure and was not meant to be a permanent mechanism.  It is a temporary measure until there is a sufficient level of competition to open it up.  That would bring prices down.  The policy is working and I believe the CER will continue to make it work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree that the Regulated Tariff Formula has been very effective when compared to the light touch regulatory system in the banks and in Eircom which has virtually brought this area to its knees and that it is important at this stage in our development, in view of the pressure being experienced by the economy and competitiveness and reducing prices?  His initial intervention nine months ago had the effect of reducing gas prices significantly but they are still 13% above the European norm.  We do not want the energy sector to become like the banks because of what happened through the regulatory regime.  Will the Minister acknowledge that the RTF is worth is holding on to for that reason alone?  It provides security and competition in the industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not know about Fine Gael&rsquo;s position but I believe competition helps to drive down prices and I have seen it work.  Therefore, my general instinct, where possible, is to let competition work in the public interest.  Ultimately, it is for the CER to decide when to turn to such a competitive unregulated market.  We are moving on that.  We need also to move in the area of electricity, in the last band that is competitive.  We are doing it on a steady basis in the gas market and that is appropriate but it is up to the CER to make the final call as to exactly when.  The general policy of using competition to bring prices down is something of which I am proud and support.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> his views on supporting the micro-generation of electricity; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[3335/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of electricity micro-generation is a key priority as part of the overall objective to deliver a more distributed and sustainable generation and network system and to reduce energy costs and carbon emissions.  In February 2009, I launched the Micro Generation Programme, which is being operated by ESB Customer Supply and supported by ESB Networks.  The programme has the potential to provide up to 4,000 domestic customers investing in micro-scale projects with a financial payment for electricity exported back to the grid.  The ESB advises that 189 customers have signed up for the scheme to date.  I have asked my Department to review the level of take-up with ESB with a view to identifying and addressing any barriers to participation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The micro-generation programme also provides for two-way metering, to be installed without additional charge to the customer.  The electricity producer is paid a price of 19 cent per kilowatt-hour, which will help to offset the start up costs.  The eligible micro technologies include wind, solar and hydro as well as combined heat and power.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is the case that micro-scale electricity production will benefit the participating customers upfront by allowing them to replace retail rate electricity with their own cheaper generated electricity.  Sustainable Energy Ireland&rsquo;s micro-generation pilot programme currently involves 42 projects and a range of technologies including wind, solar PV and micro-hydro.  Twenty-seven wind turbines and 14 solar photovoltaic installations have been commissioned and initial results are expected later this year.  The pilot programme is being carried out in conjunction with key stakeholders and is designed to assess market potential, technologies, economics and emissions savings.  The field trials are also addressing grid connection and technical standards to ensure the power security, safety and quality of installations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national smart metering pilot programme is proceeding in parallel with the current microgeneration initiative and there are important links between the two.  The data gathered from the interval meters being used in a micro-generation scheme will provide important information on import and export of electricity.  This will feed into the analysis of electricity use being carried out in the smart metering pilot programme.  In turn, the findings of the smart metering programme will  inform the development of a long-term micro-generation strategy.  Other initiatives designed to facilitate the development of micro-generation include the 2008 planning and development regulations which provide for planning permission exemptions for certain categories of micro-generation.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not supplied on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0" Just="Left">The purchase of wind turbines by companies is now eligible for accelerated capital allowances under the Finance Acts.  To be eligible for the accelerated capital allowance, the turbines must comply with the relevant eligibility criteria.  In particular, they must be for the purpose of generation of electricity primarily for on-site use by the company.  Other developments in support of micro-generation include the streamlining of licensing arrangements for compliant small scale generators and the adoption of a new standard for connection of domestic generators to the distribution system.</P><Col N="20"/>
        <P Just="Left">An SEI study completed last year points to a significant number of barriers to the deployment of micro-generation which need to be addressed.  These include: the need for further work on the impact of deployment of large numbers of micro-generators on the existing electricity distribution system; the immaturity of some of the technologies; the need for equipment standards, installation practices and codes to ensure appropriate safety and efficiency standards are in place; and the need to adopt the present administrative infrastructure for customer metering and billing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Is he disappointed at the take-up of 189 that signed up, from a target number of 4,000?  With regard to the planning the Minister mentioned, are there difficulties in getting connections at the 10.8 kilowatt level?  No planning is required up to 11 kilowatts but I am told there are problems with the connection at 10.8 kilowatts.  He might provide information on that.  </P>
        <P>Concerning the tariff of 19 cents to which the Minister referred, is it true this applies only to the first 3,000 kilowatts generated per annum?  Does the Minister propose to raise that limit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">To answer directly, yes.  We need much larger numbers and we need those 4,000 smart meters to be availed of as soon as possible.  That is why I asked the Department to go back to the ESB and others to find out why the scheme is not going as quickly as we wanted.  If necessary we will change the regulations to make it happen.  While one should be careful, one does not want to create a static market while waiting for an alternative system.  It is a matter of looking at the current rules to see if they can be adapted, not in a way that would disrupt the market but in order to make the process easier.  We must do this and there is a variety of ways by which we can do it.  Micro-generation is a crucial element within an overall distributed electricity generation mix which we must develop.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to hear answers to Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s questions because we did not receive them in the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  Going back to the ESB to ask it why there has not been more take-up on this scheme is not necessarily the way forward.  For a start, it is not in the interests of the ESB to facilitate large-scale decentralisation of power generation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I reiterate a specific question that was asked already.  The key to building a successful micro-generation industry in other countries that have been successful &mdash; Germany is probably the best example but France and, more recently, Britain can be included &mdash; is the level of export tariff set.  A tariff of 19 cent per kilowatt hour for the first 3,000 units is significantly less than the tariff made available in other countries to kickstart this industry and is in spite of the fact that Ireland has much better climatic conditions for micro-generation, in particular wind, but also bio-mass generation.  Will the Minister review the rate of 19 cent per kilowatt hour for the first 3,000 units with a view to raising it for a period?  It would significantly kickstart this industry which could employ a great number of people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>My question concerned the 3,000 kilowatt per annum limit.  Will the Minister examine that limit and either get rid of it or increase it substantially? Can he throw any light on reports that there are difficulties in connecting to the network at the higher level of up to 11 kilowatts, specifically the 10.8 generating plant?  Has he any plans to move beyond the ESB to include Bord G&aacute;is, Airtricity and others?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Stanton is correct.  This issue concerns not only the ESB but a number of different supply companies.  In fairness to the ESB, it came forward with its offer of 10 cent premium for the first 3,000 kilowatt hours.  There is a variety of ways in which this can be done.  One lesson we must learn from the success in other countries is that what is not <Col N="21"/>needed is a stop-start approach.  That sometimes bedevils some of the very high initial feeds in fixed price systems which cannot be maintained.  That is not a clever method either.  We must learn this from other countries that have worked in this area.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to whether there is a difficulty concerning the 11 kilowatt level, that is one of the benefits of doing the SEI study.  We have grant-aided up to approximately 40% of those 42 projects in order to get answers to such technical questions regarding safety, height, power output and installation systems.  The right way to do it is to answer those questions by proper surveying machines on the ground.  This is all being done with the purpose of our having an environment that can deploy micro-generation.  It has taken time but we will get there.  Micro-generation will happen, not only in households but on Irish farms, and in rural areas where the power supply is more significant, available and more consistent, it will have a significant role to play.</P>
        <P>We always said we would take this in stages, the first being the 1-11 kilowatt plant but we also recognise we need to work back down, from some of the large auto generators within industry towards the type of farming or small business environment that can use the power supplied.  It is work in progress.  More needs to be done and I am committed to it.</P>

        <Quest> his plans to introduce legislation to facilitate the development of offshore wind energy; the timescale for same. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend to bring forward shortly a policy blueprint for the development of the renewable energy offshore resource encompassing ocean and wind energy.  The national offshore renewable energy plan will take account of the significant impetus being given to offshore renewable energy at European level.  Our work as part of the North Seas countries offshore initiative together with the forthcoming EU Strategic Energy Review will focus on the priority interconnection needs across member states.  The national plan will also reflect ongoing co-operation with the UK and Northern Ireland through the ISLES project and under the British-Irish Council.  Critical to delivery of the renewable energy development plan will be the creation of a fit-for-purpose planning regime for the resource.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Act 2009, responsibility for certain foreshore functions transferred to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with effect from 15 January 2010.  This includes all energy-related developments on the foreshore, including oil, gas, wind, wave and tidal energy.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has made clear that he will introduce legislative change aimed at better integrating the foreshore consent processes with the planning processes under the Planning Acts.  This will include the new planning regime for offshore renewable energy developments, taking account of the forthcoming plan.  My Department is working closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the new regime that will reflect national and EU renewable energy objectives while taking account of the interests of stakeholders in the marine resource.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Both Departments will work with the Department of Finance, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and other relevant Departments, as well as Eirgrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation and Sustainable Energy Ireland, in delivery of the new regime.  A strategic environmental assessment, SEA, of Irish offshore renewable energy resources is being undertaken by Sustainable Energy Ireland at my Department&rsquo;s request.  This will complement and inform the design of the plan and the new offshore framework. The SEA process is being overseen by a <Col N="22"/>steering group comprising my Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage, Local Government, the SEI and the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P>Under the EU Renewables Directive, Ireland along with all member states, will submit a national renewable energy action plan by June 2010. This will set out the plans to meet our national renewable energy target and will include medium-term plans to develop an offshore grid to facilitate the export of renewable electricity.  I will also meet my UK ministerial colleague shortly in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister is thinking in terms of the super grid that was proposed in the past by people such as Eddie O&rsquo;Connor and others, whereby countries would agree to work together to build very large scale offshore generation capacity that would interconnect electricity grids of different European countries with a view to providing green energy and security of supply.  I encourage the Minister to progress this, while obviously taking into account the potential cost to the Exchequer and to energy users and endeavouring to keep down that cost.</P>
        <P>My specific intent with this question relates to the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, chaired by Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett.  Deputies McManus, Coonan and I are members of that committee.  We spent a great deal of time putting together new legislation of which the Minister is aware.  It would facilitate the fast tracking of a planning process for significant offshore energy projects.  Has the Minister looked at that legislation?  Will he use it as the basis for new legislation that might reduce the period from time of application to time of building?  There is enormous frustration at present among those in the industry concerning the length of time it takes to get permission to build offshore. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the legislation to which the Deputy refers and I am of the view it will strongly inform the new planning system for the development of offshore renewable energy projects in respect of which we will be obliged to legislate.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has primary responsibility for the delivery of the new planning system to which I refer.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I take this opportunity to suggest that I could again go before the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security in order to engage in specific discussions on offshore development.  This would enable us to try to arrive at a common vision with regard to what is our purpose.  This is a long-term project and it will not be completed within a two to five-year timeframe.  As a result, a long-term vision will be required.  If the political system in this country gives a strong direction, both at home and in Europe, to the effect that it is committed to this project, that it will build the type of interconnection and offshore infrastructure &mdash; in respect of which EirGrid is already carrying out analysis and is working on delivering &mdash; required and that it will enter into negotiations with the UK, French and other governments, it will be possible to establish an exporting industry here for the long term.</P>
        <P>We have a comparative advantage, particularly in the context of our ocean energy resource, and I am of the view that we can obtain European support.  I attended the Council of Ministers meeting in Seville last week and I argued in favour of such support being provided.  There is potential for us to attract EU support in respect of the type of project in which we are engaged.  It would serve the country well if we could come to a political agreement on the broad, long-term approach to be taken.  If such agreement is forthcoming, it will then be a matter of putting in place the necessary planning legislation.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="23"/>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>A long-term approach has certainly been adopted up to now, particularly in view of the fact that it has taken two years to transfer responsibility for this matter from one Department to another.  Does the Minister not accept that the type of goodwill to which he refers already exists?  I do not imagine that any Member would oppose the possibility of his again coming before the committee.</P>
        <P>The problem in respect of this matter relates to the difficulties involved in modernising our legislation, which is a ministerial responsibility.  Does the Minister not accept that he must set down certain timelines?  Does he further accept that this will not be easy, particularly when it is not his Department but rather the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that has responsibility in this regard?  That is the precise reason the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security produced legislation in which it is suggested that there be a one-stop shop and that the process be streamlined in order that it might deliver the goods.</P>
        <P>It is fine to refer to the long term and I am sure this goes down well at EU meetings.  However, that is not my primary concern nor, I am sure, that of Deputy Coveney.  It would be possible for the Minister to indicate now, and to everyone&rsquo;s satisfaction, what will be the timeline in respect of when the legislation will be delivered.</P>
        <P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on the ESRI report, which essentially indicates that we have enough potential in respect of producing onshore wind energy and it would not be necessary to move into the area of offshore production?  That is quite a significant conclusion for an eminent body such as the ESRI to reach.  Will the Minister comment on this matter and outline the Government&rsquo;s position in respect of it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Deputy McManus raised this issue.  I am of the view that goodwill and co-ordination at a political level are important because a consensus does not exist in certain other quarters.  In my opinion, the ESRI&rsquo;s report does not take account of the long-term opportunity that exists.  That body did not consider this industry as an exporting one.  It may have examined this matter on a purely domestic basis and failed to see the bigger picture in the context of what is happening.  If we followed such advice, we would miss the opportunity that exists.  It is for this reason we must provide a strong signal to the effect that this is the course we will take.</P>
        <P>I referred to a long-term approach but I also believe this matter to be of immediate importance.  The issue of whether the European Union should develop these grids will be one of the items on the agenda for the Heads of Government meeting to take place in the spring.  We are obliged to make our submission, as part of our renewable energy plan, by June.  It will have to be pretty much agreed and set out by that point.  If we are to obtain EU funding under the next round in 2014 &mdash; approximately the right date in the context of when construction on some of these grid networks should commence &mdash; it will be necessary to obtain European buy-in in 2011.  This means that we must present our submission this year.  To do so, we must be as confident as possible that, regardless of who is in power, we are going to pursue the approach to which I refer.</P>

        <Quest> when he plans to instruct ComReg to allow open access to all publicly and privately owed broadband infrastructure. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of ensuring access to telecommunications infrastructure is a matter for ComReg as part of its function of regulating the telecommunications markets <Col N="24"/>in accordance with the requirements of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications.  ComReg is independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions and is required by law to exercise its powers impartially and transparently.  Under the access directive of the EU regulatory framework, ComReg is required to ensure access and interconnection between telecommunications operators in order to promote efficiency and sustainable competition and provide the maximum benefit to end users.  These are legal obligations under EU and national law, which ComReg is required to enforce.</P>
        <P>There are a number of telecommunications networks owned by the State or by commercial State bodies that are available to telecommunication service providers on an open-access basis.  Some 87 metropolitan area networks, MANs &mdash; constructed by my Department, in conjunction with local and regional authorities and offering dark fibre and managed services &mdash; are available on an open-access basis to all service providers.  There are currently 35 service providers using the MANs in some of these locations.</P>
        <P>ESB Telecoms, ESBT, has built over 1,300 km of optical fibre network, which was grant-aided by my Department from Exchequer and European regional development funds.  ESBT offers dark fibre and managed bandwidth services to any service provider requiring backhaul connectivity on its network.  Aurora Telecom, a division of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, offers dark fibre on its network to service providers on an open-access basis.  The importance of open access for competition in the telecommunications market has been continually highlighted by me in policy statements governing electronic communications.  I referred to it most recently in my policy paper, Next Generation Broadband &mdash; Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister is continually highlighting the issue of open access, one must inquire as to why he is not making it happen.  The Minister has been in office for a number of years and he understands the telecommunications market quite well.  He refers to the need for open access to infrastructure but on each occasion he is asked this question he states that ComReg, in the context of its regulatory functions, is independent.  That is true.  However, ComReg is not responsible for setting policy and this is a policy issue.  A policy decision regarding whether ComReg will independently require the owners of ducting or fibre infrastructure to make such infrastructure available &mdash; in the interests of competition &mdash; to other operators for their use is going to be required.</P>
        <P>I presume the Minister is familiar with the position in France and the success that has been achieved as a result of ducting infrastructure being opened up to competition on a national basis.  What happened in France has promoted competition, brought about reduced prices and improved services.  That is the kind of model I would like to be implemented in Ireland through an independent regulator.  However, ComReg cannot make the decision to implement it.  A Minister must give a policy direction to an independent regulator to implement it.</P>
        <P>It is disingenuous for the Minister to state that there are 87 metropolitan area networks available for use in this country, particularly when he is aware that a significant percentage of these do not even have backhaul capacity.  Some of them are mere fibre rings &mdash; for which the taxpayer has footed the bill &mdash; which were laid around certain towns but which are not connected to a backhaul infrastructure.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is allowed one minute in which to pose supplementary questions and he has already spoken for three minutes.  This means that other Members will suffer.  I want to be as flexible as possible but the Deputy should show some respect for the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given a very clear policy direction to the effect that we want to move towards open access.  Yesterday, Eircom and ComReg reached an agreement in respect of this matter.  They were due in court today in respect of a ComReg decision to bring the cost of wholesale line rental down from &euro;8.41 to 77 cent per month.  This means the new rental price will be less than 10% of that which previously applied and it shows that the policy approach does work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not inquire about that matter.  Will the Minister answer my question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy did inquire about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Will he require open access to infrastructure?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy inquired about what ComReg is doing to deliver open access.  That which I have outlined represents a massive change and is a major indicator in the context of delivery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked what the Minister is doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I set the policy framework within which ComReg makes its decisions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The one-stop shop was supposed to have been established six months ago.  However, there is still no sign of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The 90% plus reduction achieved yesterday in crucial rental charges in respect of hundreds of thousands of lines throughout the country is an example of how policy can work and how open access can be provided.  That is an example of a policy working, bringing prices down and providing open access on the market, and it was achieved yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a specific question.  Will the Minister instruct the regulator to introduce an open-access policy to all ducting infrastructure in order to facilitate those private companies that want to lay fibre to increase and improve broadband speeds?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which is dying on its feet, is the lack of a high-speed broadband system in the area?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="26"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>At the forum we held on next generation broadband in Dublin Castle involving all sides in the debate, I gave a very clear consistent signal that we need to develop a co-operative model that is also still competitive.  It needs to be co-operative in terms of providing open wholesale access.  Crucially, that is now being delivered; it is starting to work and happen, in the MANs, which are being used increasingly, in the dramatic fall in line rental on a wholesale basis,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>May I ask a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in the schools broadband infrastructure, which we are providing, and in the one-stop shop that we are progressing.  In the Seanad, as we speak, a series of measures are being taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister require open access to infrastructure?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Those measures will provide open access in a plethora of different ways to bring us back up to the very top of the league in broadband.  That is happening.  It happened yesterday in the courts and will happen in the Seanad tomorrow when we push the legislation through.  I believe it will work; it is the right policy as against the alternative, which would have been a direct intervention, paying over money to the former Eircom owners which would not have worked.  I am very glad we did not pursue this as a policy unlike others who proposed it.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 147 together.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and I have stated on a number of occasions our commitment to the early provision of a legislative framework for the exploration for and development of geothermal energy.  Accordingly, in the course of 2009, I instructed my Department to prioritise the drafting of a general scheme of a Bill with a view to producing heads in early 2010, with detailed legislative drafting to follow by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  Considerable progress has been made in this regard and I understand that the drafting of the heads is on target for completion in February 2010.</P>
        <P>It is important to stress that geothermal energy is a new area of legislative endeavour in this jurisdiction and the Bill is likely to be substantial, dealing with a range of matters such as ownership of the resource, regulation and licensing of exploration and development, ancillary rights and protection of third party interests.  We have engaged closely with industry and interested parties in a series of meetings and workshops to ensure legislative proposals have the benefit of their input.  While the preparation of legislation is being expedited urgently, it is not possible at this juncture to commit to a date for publication.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike the answer to the previous question, I welcome the answer to this one.  While it is overdue, introducing legislation to facilitate geothermal technology will allow a new and renewable source of district heating systems and energy generation through <Col N="27"/>gas turbine technology.  This is quite a substantial industry in other European countries and can also provide a major source of heat and energy generation capacity here.  I encourage the Minister to bring the legislation before the House as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s comments in that regard.  It is a major Bill and needs to be drafted at the same time as we are producing the minerals development Bill, which is also very extensive.  However, I believe it will be possible to develop both Bills quickly and I look forward to introducing them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised that this question was not answered by the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan; perhaps he is away on other business.  The Minister of State has made the introduction of geothermal legislation a priority.  He certainly talked the talk when he attended a meeting of the Oireachtas committee.  There is considerable disappointment now because developers who want to engage in this kind of exploration and develop a renewable resource had felt some optimism following what the Minister of State had said.  However, it now seems it is all back to some kind of commitment that it will happen at some time in the future.  Is the Minister, Deputy Ryan, now again responsible for geothermal legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It falls under the remit and brief of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  He is absolutely right that it is being given priority.  Resources from my Department and the Office of the Attorney General are being allocated to it to get it over the line as quickly as possible.  Getting the heads of a Bill in February, in the very short time since it was proposed to take that action, is a very quick response.  When the Deputy sees the Bill she will understand its scale.  It will be in place some months after that and hopefully put into action by a range of different developers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the sensitivity and importance of the discussions taking place in Northern Ireland, which I hope can be brought to a successful conclusion.  As I have pointed out on many occasions in the past, the Government has the full support of the Fine Gael Party and I am sure all Opposition parties in reaching a successful conclusion to the matter.  I wish those involved in the talks well.</P>
        <P>Today, Standards &amp; Poor&rsquo;s has downgraded the rating of the Irish banks.  I wish to raise the issue of lending capacity and ability to extend credit to businesses.  Every business in the country now has a difficulty with the banks.  When the National Asset Management Agency legislation was passed we were told it would be the panacea for all business ills and would sort out the problem of lack of credit facilities for businesses.  The directors of banks have told the Oireachtas committee that they have no intention of lending back bonds given to them as credit for business.  Most of the valuations are now being conducted and are being transferred to NAMA and on to banks.  What is the Government&rsquo;s estimate of how much more will need to be invested into the banks in the form of recapitalisation from the taxpayer following the &euro;11 billion invested last year?  Having access to information from NAMA and from the banks, the Government should be in a position to ascertain the extent of the black hole that will need to be covered by the taxpayer in the form of extra recapitalisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the comments made on the ongoing talks in Northern Ireland between the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister and all parties.  We are all hopeful that as the discussions continue they will reach a fruitful outcome.  As the House will appreciate, it is the reason the Taoiseach is not here this afternoon to answer questions. </P>
        <P>On the issue of lending capacity and access to working capital in particular, this is subject to ongoing discussion and I am acutely aware of it as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I have been working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in this regard.  Both the first and second Mazars reports have been helpful in looking at the lending capacity of the banks and what has been happening within business.  I have had occasion to meet with the Governor of the Central Bank in order to have access to new agreed measures on how we may determine real lending.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue as to what type of real lending was being made to business was raised here in the House.  That has been agreed between Forf&aacute;s, the Department of Finance and me and we are looking at the issue of access to credit.  A credit supply clearing group has been set up by my Department, and we are working through it, between business, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, county enterprise boards and the banking and lending people to determine how we may create openness and awareness about the needs of business.  On that basis I have trans<Col N="29"/>ferred personnel from Enterprise Ireland into the two major banks, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, and this is working quite well.  We are continuing to work and address the issue of access to working capital for people within business.  In the context of the budget and NAMA a new appointment has been made to arbitrate on differences of opinion between the banking institutions and businesses who believe they are entitled to working capital.</P>
        <P>I am not completely satisfied that the amount of working capital being made available is sufficient to furnish the needs of the business community.  On that basis I am again working with the banks and the business community so that we may establish the absolute necessity for a change of attitude within the banks and move them away from their reliance heretofore on construction to an expertise on business so that they may take on board the need to take particular risks in the context of supporting people within business.</P>
        <P>On the issue of recapitalisation of the banks, the Government would be more comfortable with access to funding from the private sector, but we are not in a position to make a final determination on the needs of banks as that matter has not been finalised by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a change of attitude on the part of the banks.  I dealt with seven businesses yesterday that had been called in by the banks.  These were legitimate businesses, well run, where nobody had stepped out of line and they borrowed the money on a variable rate.  They were called in along with their accountants.  The banks make projections as to what the income of those businesses will be for 2010 and then decide how much to impose on top of the borrowing rate.  People who have run their businesses well and took the risk in borrowing at variable rates are now being screwed by the banks, as the T&aacute;naiste is aware, since some of them have been in contact with her. </P>
        <P>Is the facility for declined cases operational in the Department of Finance?  It was supposed to be, but I cannot find any trace of it.  Does the T&aacute;naiste not agree that there is a real crunch with Irish business in respect of working capital and if so, given her close relationships with the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank, can she name three initiatives the Government is taking to help small business get credit?</P>
        <P>Does the T&aacute;naiste see any relevance now in the proposal put forward by Deputy Richard Bruton for a national recovery bank which would inject a new stream of money into the Irish system, as has happened in other countries &mdash; with the chief executives coming before the Oireachtas committee and saying they will not lend any facilities they receive through NAMA back to Irish business?  I know the T&aacute;naiste is acutely aware of many businesses that are on the line because they cannot get working capital.  I asked her what extra money the taxpayer will have to provide in the context of bank recapitalisation.  Some &euro;11 billion was injected last year.  Will it be &euro;5 billion, &euro;6 billion, &euro;7 billion or &euro;10 billion since rumours are floating around about the vast sums that will have to be put up as recapitalisation?  The T&aacute;naiste is talking to the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance and the Government has to have a view on this.</P>
        <P>What is the Government&rsquo;s estimate of the figure needed for further recapitalisation of the banks that will have to be put up by the already downbeaten taxpayer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>A person has been appointed  who will adjudicate on cases that have been declined.  I have facilitated that person&rsquo;s accommodation in Enterprise Ireland, although the role is independent of that agency.  I am also providing secretarial and administrative assistance to allow that work to commence. </P>
        <P>On the issue of attitudinal change, I am aware of a number of companies that have come forward on the basis of increased rates of interest, for example, changes by which people have obtained access to overdrafts, etc.  My Department, the agencies and I have been working with <Col N="30"/>the banks to facilitate such people who have the bona fides as regards trading successfully through difficult times.  It was on that basis that I introduced the stabilisation fund which is working very well.  Some &euro;56 million has been allocated since the end of last year.  The employment subsidy scheme is supporting people to keep them in work and has been used as an enormously beneficial way in which we can support companies with trading difficulties, where there are viabilities and vulnerabilities.  These are being supported by all of the agencies.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a second tranche has been advertised and I hope we will very quickly have a final determination on those who will be supported.  That work is being done by Enterprise Ireland.  We are investing in the stabilisation of many of these concerns, supporting these companies in the context of providing new opportunities for them.  That is the work being done by the agencies under my remit and that of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  On the issue of recapitalisation or the capital supports that may be needed in the context of financial institutions, these will not be determined by picking a number off the top of one&rsquo;s head.  It will be done in an analytical way and, as I have indicated, clearly our preference is for that capital to be raised from private sources in the first instance.  There has been no final determination by the Minister for Finance or the Government as to what those capital requirements will be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of Fine Gael in expressing the hope that the talks in Belfast will reach a successful conclusion.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to say we support the efforts of the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister in trying to bring about a resolution to matters, in particular the long-awaited devolution of the policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly. </P>
        <P>I want to ask the T&aacute;naiste about pay.  By the end of this week every employee of the State will have his or her pay cut for the second time in less than a year.  Workers in the public sector earning &euro;25,000 a year will have  their pay cut by &euro;160 a month, the pay of a garda or teacher in the middle of his or her scale will have been cut by &euro;400 a month and that of a staff nurse with ten years experience will have been cut by &euro;560 a month.</P>
        <P>Does the T&aacute;naiste appreciate the level of anger among such State employees?  That anger has been compounded by the sweetheart arrangement which the Government made with senior civil servants to limit the impact of the pay cuts on those senior officers.  We are now beginning to see pay cuts in the public sector being used to drive down levels of pay in the voluntary and private sectors.  I have a circular which was issued by the HSE to agencies and charities it funds, directing them to cut the pay of their staff by the same amount as cuts in the public sector, even though there is no legislative basis for that.  In addition, those staff are not public servants and were not included in the legislation passed by the Oireachtas before Christmas.</P>
        <P>Over the weekend we saw reports of plans by the Government to provide for an inability to pay provision in respect of some categories of workers who are covered by legally enforceable minimum rates of pay.  There have been repeated reports that it is intended to cut the national minimum wage.</P>
        <P>I have three questions for the T&aacute;naiste arising from that.  First, what assurance, if any, can she give to workers who have had their pay cut not once but twice over the last year that they will not have their pay cut again?  Second, can she tell us on what legal basis the HSE, or any other public authority for that matter, is issuing directives to agencies funded by it that they have to cut pay the same as for public servants?  Third, will the T&aacute;naiste rule out cutting the national minimum wage?</P>

	<P>I acknowledge the Labour Party leader&rsquo;s comments on the talks in Northern Ireland.  We all agree on wishing those involved well.  </P><Col N="31"/>
        <P>As regards the pay reductions that have taken place within the public service, all of us who work with public servants daily are aware of the anger, disappointment and distress these have caused.  It is equally important to say that these difficult decisions had to be made on the basis of the economic difficulties the country has to grapple with currently.  Dealing with the stabilisation of our public finances is one of the parameters by which we can return to economic growth.  We are aware that notification has been given of industrial action.  If necessary, the Government will certainly be open to any opportunity to discuss those issues with the relevant representatives.  However, all of that would have to be in the context of meaningful engagement and the creation of conditions for meaningful engagement would be equally important.</P>
        <P>I note that the Deputy raised the HSE issue with the Taoiseach last week.  Unfortunately, his letter to the Deputy has not yet been signed as he has not been available to do so.  On the Taoiseach&rsquo;s behalf, however, I can say that following the matter raised by the Deputy, the HSE has advised that this circular was sent in error.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Professor Drumm has issued a clarification to those people in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is important to reiterate the absolute necessity of having clarity on the minimum wage.  Changes to the minimum wage, if any, will be done in the context of proposals that will come from the Labour Court.  They are currently with the Labour Court and I am not in a position to make any adjudication until that matter comes to my desk.  I must, therefore, be independent in making any determination on it.  However, EROs and REAs have caused a slight mix-up in the media recently.  That legislation is coming to this House today whereby an inability to pay clause will be introduced by the Government for consideration here.  As the Deputy is aware, there is already an inability to pay clause in the minimum wage legislation, but from what I can ascertain it has never been used.  This is being introduced in the context of representations that have been made by Members of this House and others, whereby an agreement has been made between employers and employees to reduce wages to keep people in work.  That is legal in the context of REAs and EROs.  On that basis, we have introduced a sensible approach to addressing issues of real concern to employers and employees so that they can remain within the parameters of the legislation and not work outside it.  We are taking a sensible approach to keeping people in their jobs.</P>

	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s statement referring to the letter that is on its way to me from the Taoiseach to the effect that the HSE circular was issued in error.  Can I take it that agencies which do not comply with the stated wishes of the HSE to cut staff pay will not, as a result, have their allocations cut correspondingly by the HSE?</P>
        <P>I note the T&aacute;naiste has hedged her bets on the national minimum wage.  As I understand it, that issue has been with the Labour Court since November 2008.  We do not seem to be any further advanced on it.  We hear every day that the Government wants to restore confidence, purchasing power and get retail activity moving again.  However, it is difficult for people, particularly those on low pay, to make purchasing commitments if they do not know what their wages are going to be next year.  It is time the Government came off the fence concerning the national minimum wage.  It should give a categorical and fair assurance that the national minimum wage will not be cut.</P>
        <P>I do not want to anticipate the debate on the Bill and the Government&rsquo;s amendment with regard to the inability to pay clause for EROs.  However, I interpret what the T&aacute;naiste is saying <Col N="32"/>to mean that it will only apply on a voluntary basis.  If that is the case, so be it, but let us see what is actually being proposed by the Government.</P>
        <P>The one question the T&aacute;naiste did not reply to was when I asked her for an assurance that workers who have taken a pay cut, and particularly those who have had their pay cut twice in the past year, would not have their pay cut again.  At the weekend, we heard the Taoiseach&rsquo;s radio interview in which he spoke of the necessity for restoring confidence to the economy, all of which we agree with.  However, if people are to have confidence in the economy and consumer confidence is to be restored, people need to have some certainty about their earnings.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give an assurance that the Government will not be going back a third time to cut the pay of employees whose pay has already been cut?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the legislation before the House, the Minister of State will take on board the views expressed by Members of the Oireachtas.  We are providing a statutory basis to allow an inability to pay clause for REAs and EROs.  It has not been made available heretofore, but is available within the minimum wage legislation.  It is a practical and pragmatic response to issues raised by Members of the Oireachtas, as well as by employers and employees in the context of keeping people in work. </P>
        <P>On the HSE issue, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s letter indicates that the HSE issued an early warning notice to its grant-aided voluntary agencies, anticipating incorrectly that the pay reductions for public servants under the financial emergency measures would automatically apply to their agencies.  In fact, grant-aided agencies funded under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 are not directly affected by pay adjustments provided for under the financial emergency measures.  Therefore, as they are not public service bodies as defined in that Act, their employees are not public servants.  That matter has been clarified for those employees.  I can forward the letter to the Deputy when it has been signed.</P>
        <P>With regard to assurances as to what will happen in the future, we have just completed the budgetary process and the Finance Bill has yet to be brought before the House.  Therefore, nobody on this side of the House is in a position to predetermine what will happen in the context of budgetary adjustments next year.  However, the Government is still very anxious to involve itself in public sector reform.  That reform will create savings and will, therefore, have a positive effect on the need for any further financial adjustments in next year&rsquo;s budget.</P>

Following that, will time be made available for a discussion on the lost at sea report?  That is already agreed in principle.  We have not had an opportunity to have a debate on Northern Ireland in the House for some time.  Will the T&aacute;naiste convey to the Whip that we should have a discussion on Northern Ireland?  I hope the talks taking place currently come to a successful conclusion.</P>
        <P>I raise with the T&aacute;naiste an issue I raised with her last Thursday.  Under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 the Government is entitled to lay before the House recommendations to set up a commission of investigation.  However, the Government has decided to have a secret inquiry into the banks where no evidence will be given in public.  The comments of a former Supreme Court judge today suggest it is very difficult for people to have any kind of trust or faith in secret hearings.  Under the Act, persons are fully entitled to give their evidence to such commissions of investigation in public if they so wish.  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, there is no constitutional impediment nor no legal obstacle in the matter of questions of policy being discussed before the commission of investigation in public.  I hope the Taoiseach and his predecessor will make a direction that their hearings be in public as they are matters of policy which, I contend, were partly responsible for the economic crash.</P><Col N="34"/>
        <P>The Taoiseach said last week that the Oireachtas would be involved at every step in the process of arriving at the terms of reference for the commission of investigation.  However, when one examines the Act, it is the Government that sets the terms of reference and the Governor of the Central Bank and the other person to be appointed will place the reports before the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas will be &ldquo;briefed&rdquo;.  As far as I can see, in the secondary legislation that is required, the Oireachtas has no function in determining the terms of reference.  There should, at the least, be discussion with the Opposition parties about the terms of reference, because the principal Act refers only to Government and to Government laying its terms of reference in report before the Oireachtas.  However, the secondary legislation that will be required to give evidence to what the Taoiseach said last week, namely, that the Oireachtas would be involved at every step, will mean that amendments must be made to allow for that to happen.  Will the Government discuss its views in respect of the appropriate terms of reference for the investigation with the Opposition parties?  Will it make amendments to allow for that to happen to give effect to the words of the Taoiseach in the House last week, so that this is not seen to be, what I believe it is, a secret inquiry held behind closed doors?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The lost at sea report will be debated in the House next week by agreement.  On the question of a debate on Northern Ireland, if there is a satisfactory outcome today or tomorrow to the ongoing talks, it would be an opportune time for the House to discuss the situation.  We will await the outcome of the deliberations and the Whips can discuss the question of a debate at their meeting this week.</P>
        <P>On the issue of Oireachtas involvement in the commission of investigation, the Taoiseach has indicated his availability for any inquiry taking place.  The Governor and the international expert, when appointed, will be available to the Oireachtas prior to the scoping study.  The scoping report will also be debated by the Oireachtas and the views and perspectives of all Members, Opposition or otherwise, can be brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance.  Therefore, in that context there will be involvement of Members of the Oireachtas.  With regard to the terms of reference, the Act does not make a clear determination of the terms of reference and that will be a matter for the Minister for Finance.  However, he gave an undertaking that he will take into consideration the views of all Members.  With regard to whether he will meet Members of the Opposition in this regard, I will put that to him.  He has never been found wanting with regard to working with Members of the Opposition or with regard to briefing them on any matter.</P>

        <P>With regard to the banking issue, will the T&aacute;naiste clarify a few points on the toothless secret investigation the Government is offering as an excuse for an inquiry?  Will the Government be making a proposal to the House on this?  It proposed an amendment to the Labour Party motion last week and had it accepted.  It set out its alternative in a very general, vague way.  Will the Government be bringing specific proposals to the House with regard to the establishment of an inquiry?  If so, when?  Will it bring its proposal to have an investigator or expert before the House for approval?  Will the terms of reference of any investigation be brought to the House for its approval?  Has the Government made any decision in respect of any aspect of the investigation it is offering as a replacement for a proper inquiry?  We debated this last week and the Government professed itself to be very anxious to get on with it.</P><Col N="35"/>
        <P>Has the Government made a decision yet on the proposal by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to have a directly elected mayor of Dublin and to have the election conducted this year?

Nobody, apart from the Minister, Deputy Gormley, knows what the office will entail and how it will relate to the rest of the local government system in Dublin.</P>

	<P>It is the intention of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to introduce the legislation establishing the role of directly elected mayor to the city of Dublin this year and to have the election this year.</P>
        <P>With regard to the inquiry and other questions that have been raised on a number of occasions, contrary to what members of the Opposition are saying about the inquiry it is being set up by the Government to ensure that findings, recommendations and facts will be established and that these will be published, considered and debated.  This is what everyone wants to see.  It will be time efficient and cost effective.  Other issues must be borne in mind.</P>
        <P>This inquiry is being set up to underpin confidence, not to undermine it.  It is on that basis that we will be working with Members of the Oireachtas in considering issues raised by them.  There are disparate views on both sides of the House as to how this will happen, the reasons the inquiry should be established and how it should be set up.</P>
        <P>The appointment of the international expert will be a matter for the Government.  The terms of reference will be set down after the scoping report is debated by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister will consider the views expressed by Members on what the terms of reference should be.  Clearly, it will be a matter for the Government, including the Minister for Finance, to make the final determination on the terms of reference.</P>

The legislative programme for the autumn session stated the forestry Bill would be available in mid-2010 but the legislative programme for this session states it is not possible to indicate at this stage when publication is expected.</P>
        <P>I am very surprised about the status of the Bill to provide for the establishment of a statutory body to manage the Curragh, with the exception of the military establishment of the Defence Forces&rsquo; training centre, and to update the existing Curragh of Kildare Act.  As far as I can remember, the legislation was on various legislative programmes for the past five years.  Before Christmas, publication was expected late in 2010 but now the Bill has disappeared altogether from the legislative programme.  What is the position?

There will also be a second Bill on financial regulatory matters.  If possible it will consolidate all Central Bank legislation into a single statute in 2010.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs indicated at a conference in the midlands today that the Government is or will be considering legislation to control head shops.  Has that issue come to Cabinet yet?  It is important to have effective legislation.  There are several proposals as to how that might be done either by licensing, amendments to planning laws or the listing of various substances.  What consideration has been given to the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State indicated some issues of concern have been brought to his attention.  It is his intention, along with the Minister for Health and Children, to deal with these.  Some action has been taken with regard to specific substances that have been banned.  The introduction of regulation is being considered by the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, and the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>

	<P>I wish to raise the education (patronage) Bill, the George Mitchell scholarship fund (Amendment) Bill and the qualification (education and training) Bill.  The Minister for Education and Science recently announced unilaterally his intention to dissolve the National University of Ireland and that some of its functions would be carried out by the proposed body in the latter Bill while others would be carried out by the Seanad.  When will the legislation for the reform of the Seanad, including a referendum to alter the Constitution, be brought before the House?  Will it be a general package or come in stages?  When will the other Bills be introduced?</P>

	<P>I am pleased the Minister for Transport is in the Chamber.  I tabled a parliamentary question asking him about the charges set by him for a driver&rsquo;s licence and a driving test.  The question was disallowed by you, a Cheann Comhairle, on the basis that the Minister has no official responsibility to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for this matter and it is one for the Road Safety Authority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>It is another example of Ministers, with the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s assistance, abdicating responsibility for their tasks.  Unfortunately, it would appear that either the Ceann Comhairle or the Minister&rsquo;s officials who advised him to disallow the question are wrong as I have identified the relevant statutory instruments.  SI No. 130/2009, Road Traffic (Licensing Of Drivers) (Amendment) Regulations sets various fees for various driver licences and was signed by the then Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Noel Ahern.  Section 45 of SI No. 203/2009, Road Traffic (Driving Instructor Licensing) (No. 2) Regulations details the charges for driving tests and was signed by the Minister for Transport, Deputy <Col N="39"/>Dempsey, on 29 May 2009.  Will the Ceann Comhairle explain to me why these questions were disallowed when they deal directly with Minister&rsquo;s responsibility?  Are Ministers advising the Ceann Comhairle to refuse questions or is it that his office is not aware for what Ministers are responsible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not advise on these matters.  If we get some notice about this, we can deal with the query.  There are various ways the Deputy can raise it.  He can make contact with the office and we can discuss it.  We can deal with it that way.</P>

	<P>The Ceann Comhairle has refused this question on the basis that the Minister is not responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the matter.  However, there are two statutory instruments, signed under the official seal of the Minister for Transport, which show he has responsibility but the Ceann Comhairle has disallowed them.  He may have done so because of an error on his part or bogus advice from the Minister.  I believe we have a right to an answer in this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>I did give you notice, a Cheann Comhairle.  I will write to you specifically about it and I will raise it again if I do not get satisfaction.</P>
        <P>I also want to raise the matter of S.I. No. 590/2009, Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 (Commencement) Order 2009, which is listed in today&rsquo;s Order Paper.  Will the T&aacute;naiste advise us if this will be applied retrospectively?  While it appears on the Order Paper today it came into force on 21 January 2010, as appears to be the case in respect of public sector pay cuts.  Does the statutory instrument include a mechanism which allowed the Minister for Finance to exempt assistant secretaries from the full force of the pay cuts and, if so, under which mechanism may we challenge it?</P>

We first heard three Bills would be introduced and were then told two or one would be introduced.  The issue has now returned to the melting pot.

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am pleased to introduce the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009 for the consideration of the D&aacute;il and I wish to acknowledge the input of the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann who discussed this Bill in the autumn session.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the existing system for the making of both employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements and to provide for their continued effective operation.  In the context of the Towards 2016 review and transitional agreement, the Government and the social partners had agreed to the implementation of a series of measures on aspects of employment rights and compliance.  These included, in particular, the introduction of legislation to strengthen the arrangements for the making of the employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements that have been features of our legal system for over 60 years and to provide for their continued effective operation.  I am pleased to say that, notwithstanding the current difficulties regarding national level social dialogue, this commitment is being met within the framework of this Bill.</P>
        <P>The joint labour committee, JLC, and registered employment agreement, REA, systems have been the subject of a number of recent legal challenges that have come before the High Court.  As well as raising issues specific to particular EROs or REAs, these challenges also related to the constitutional propriety of the legislative provisions under which they were made.  This Bill will provide for a number of amendments to the existing legislative framework surrounding the JLC and REA systems, including improved procedures, and clear principles and policies to be taken into account by JLCs when formulating proposals for EROs.  The Bill also provides that EROs and REAs will be given legal effect in future by ministerial order and that a perceived gap in the scope of parliamentary supervision will be filled by providing for Oireachtas scrutiny of these instruments.</P>
        <P>Joint labour committees are independent bodies composed of representatives of employers and workers in a particular sector with a chairman who is appointed by the Minister.  There are currently 13 JLCs in existence.  The committees meet periodically to discuss and agree rates of pay and conditions of employment to apply to workers in a particular sector.  JLCs operate <Col N="46"/>in areas where collective bargaining is not well established and wages tend to be low, for example, in the hospitality sector, hairdressing, retail groceries and contract cleaning.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the difficulties that many firms operating in sectors covered by EROs are experiencing.  I appreciate that these issues, along with the impact of strengthened arrangements for inspection and enforcement, have also been of concern to Members of this House.  These difficulties have been to the fore throughout a series of meetings that I have had, since I took office as Minister of State in this Department, where I have met with the representatives of employer organisations and of those employed in these sectors, and I am aware that Deputy Penrose facilitated a meeting of the joint committee on these issues before Christmas.</P>
        <P>In my view the parties represented on a JLC are best placed to address the impact of the economic crisis on employment levels and the viability of services in their sectors.  They are the ones who must discuss and reflect on the new realities in the context of the downturn in the economy.</P>
        <P>At national level the social partners co-operated in recent years in developing a range of improvements designed to modernise the JLC system as envisaged under previous social partnership agreements.  These reforms have facilitated the amalgamation and abolition by agreement of a number of JLCs, the strengthening of their operational arrangements through the standardisation of the content of EROs and have facilitated a closer alignment of the variation of EROs with the cycle of adjustments of the national minimum wage.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to say that the representatives who comprise the membership of particular JLCs have also demonstrated this shared capacity for co-operation.  This is reflected in the agreements reached on the adjustment of the Sunday premium rate from double time to time plus one third that have already taken effect in hotels and catering establishments over recent months.  That same realism has informed the successful efforts made by both sides within the agriculture and retail sectors to reach agreement on the deferral of increases in minimum rates that otherwise would have fallen due.</P>
        <P>The recent adjustments to the minimum pay and conditions in these key sectors were all jointly agreed between the employers&rsquo; and workers&rsquo; representatives within the respective joint labour committees.  In each instance, a consensus position supporting modifications to the statutory pay and conditions was reflected in the proposals presented by the committee to the Labour Court.  The submission of these proposals followed a process of open consultation in which any member of the public could make representations to the joint labour committees concerning their published proposals.  While the Labour Court considers these proposals and may refer them back to the committee for further consideration, it has no power to impose provisions that are at variance with those submitted to it by a joint labour committee.  The significant variations in existing rates that were recently secured by agreement between the employers&rsquo; and workers&rsquo; representatives on the catering and retail joint labour committees were all arrived at by consensus and without any need to rely on the exercise of a casting vote by the independent chairman appointed to facilitate the work of these committees.</P>
        <P>It is exactly 100 years since bodies empowered to set minimum wages were first established in Britain and Ireland under the Trade Boards Act 1909.  As part of the major reform of the Irish industrial relations pioneered by the late Se&aacute;n Lemass in 1946, these bodies were given the new title of joint labour committees and their competence was expanded beyond the fixing of minimum wages only so as to cover the regulation of conditions of employment as well.  Se&aacute;n Lemass decided to amend the powers of the original trade boards and to transfer the supervisory and order making functions that had been exercised by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce in the years after the foundation of the State to the new, independent <Col N="47"/>Labour Court.  Under the provisions of the 1946 Act, when a JLC agrees terms and conditions, it makes proposals to the Labour Court on foot of which the court can make employment regulation orders, ERO.</P>
        <P>I am proposing a change that will restore the position whereby the Minister makes the order giving effect to these proposals.  At the same time, I am proposing to strengthen the manner in which the functions delegated to JLCs are supervised by the Labour Court and to ensure that the statute sets out a clear set of procedures and principles within which the delegated functions are to be discharged.  I am also proposing that the standard legislative provision dealing with the laying of statutory instruments before the Oireachtas will apply henceforth to these orders.</P>
        <P>The Irish system of registered employment agreements has been in force since 1946 and reflects the European tradition of labour law support for autonomous collective bargaining.  In most other EU countries similar provisions apply in employment law facilitating the general enforceability of certain collective agreements, either through legislation or other administrative measures.</P>
        <P>Collective agreements can be presented to the Labour Court for registration.  Where the Labour Court is satisfied that the agreement presented satisfies the statutory requirements, it registers that agreement.  The effect of this is to make the provisions of the agreement legally enforceable in respect of every worker of the class, type or group to which it is expressed to apply and to his or her employer, even if such worker or employer is not a party to the agreement.</P>
        <P>In line with the arrangements I have already mentioned in the case of employment regulations orders, I am proposing an amendment that will ensure that henceforth such orders confirming the terms of a new or varied agreement will be made by the Minister rather than simply under the authority of the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides for the amendment of the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; under section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  Access to the dispute settling agencies &mdash; Labour Relations Commission, Labour Court and Rights Commissioner Service &mdash; is governed by the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in section 23.  At present, vocational education committee, VEC, officers do not have access to these agencies, as they are specifically excluded from the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo;. Up to now these officers have been served by a scheme of conciliation and arbitration, but now they wish to be able to access the dispute settling agencies available to workers generally.  This amendment would allow officers of vocational education committees, VECs, other than teachers access to the dispute settling agencies.  Teachers in VECs would continue to be served by a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  I intend also to follow the evolving best practice in parliamentary procedure with regard to the use of delegated powers by deleting the provision that had enabled the Government to amend the definition of worker simply by order.  This will ensure future changes in the definition of worker will be made only by means of primary legislation.  To avoid any doubt in this regard, a ministerial order of 1998, giving local authority staff access to the dispute settling agencies, is also being confirmed by a proposed amendment of the statute.</P>
        <P>During the debate in the Seanad, the Bill received a general welcome and most contributions emphasised the need to maintain protection for the most vulnerable workers and to ensure that the existing mechanisms for making sure employment regulation orders, EROs, and registered employment agreements, REAs, are operating effectively and are generally fit for purpose.  It was acknowledged that the Bill is part of a suite of measures intended to strengthen and uphold the protection of the rights of employees and to secure greatly increased public confidence in the system of compliance.  The proposed arrangements for Oireachtas scrutiny of both EROs and REAs were also generally welcomed.</P><Col N="48"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce an inability to pay provision that could be adapted to the specific context of EROs and REAs respectively was also welcomed by most contributors to the debate in the Seanad as a means of introducing some flexibility into the existing mechanisms, while also helping to shore up such mechanisms against the risk of legal challenge.</P>
        <P>Deputies may recall that I had originally outlined my intentions in this regard when I addressed the McGill Summer School last year, at the time of publication of the Bill.  Subsequently, the issue has been pursued through direct discussions and in subsequent exchanges with the main employer and trade union organisations.  It was also aired in general terms during the debate in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Inability to pay mechanisms, or &ldquo;hardship clauses&rdquo; as they are known in the context of sectoral collective agreements on the European continent, are not new developments.  When I spoke on this topic last year, I suggested that it might be timely to consider bringing the joint labour committee and registered employment agreements systems into line with the procedures already established under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  These procedures allow individual employers to submit inability to pay claims to the Labour Court for adjudication.  Similarly, successive national pay agreements have included inability to pay clauses, enabling firms experiencing difficult economic conditions to plead inability to pay the centrally agreed terms and to seek to have a dispute over the matter resolved through formal procedures.</P>
        <P>I wish to provide this same flexibility and responsiveness within our sectoral-level wage setting mechanisms and to ensure that the necessary procedures and safeguards are in place to protect the rights of the workers affected.  The use of inability to pay or hardship clauses is already a feature of sectoral collective agreements within several continental European countries.  As in the case of the evolution of the provisions under national agreements in Ireland, inability to pay clauses in these continental collective agreements may be triggered only by a real and measurable crisis of the firm and they include procedures for a third party adjudication on the firm&rsquo;s financial situation.  It makes no sense to dismiss such inability to pay mechanisms as symptomatic of a retrograde race to the bottom.  On the contrary, they are a response to the situation of employers in temporary difficulty and incorporate built-in safeguards to ensure the interests of employees are sufficiently protected.  I intend to have the proposed measure ready for consideration by the House when we take the Bill on Committee Stage and I look forward to the input of the House on this measure this evening and tomorrow.</P>
        <P>I outline to the House the general provisions.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title, citation, construction and commencement provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the definitions associated with the Bill.  Section 3 provides for a new definition of a registered employment agreement to differentiate those made before the commencement of this legislation, that is, registered by the Labour Court and those made afterwards, that is, those registered agreements that have been confirmed by ministerial order.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides for the confirmation by order of a registered employment agreement by the Minister.  Following receipt of a copy of an agreement, the Minister shall make an order confirming the terms of the agreement.  The standard legislative provision dealing with the laying of the order before the Oireachtas by the Minister will apply.  Section 4 also provides that the introduction of the new procedure will not detract from the validity of an existing REA made before the commencement of the Act.</P>
        <P>Sections 5 and 6 provide for the same procedure as under section 4 in respect of an order to vary an agreement or to cancel an agreement respectively.  Section 7 provides for a new definition of an employment regulation order to differentiate those made before the commencement of the legislation.  Section 8 provides for the principles and policies to which a joint labour <Col N="49"/>committee, JLC, must have regard when formulating proposals to submit to the Labour Court for employment regulation orders.  In this context, a JLC must have regard to the legitimate interests of the workers, the legitimate interests of the employers, the prevailing economic circumstances, the prevailing employment circumstances of the workers, the prevailing commercial circumstances of the employers and the terms of any national agreement relating to pay and conditions for the time being in force.</P>
        <P>Section 8 also provides that where an employment regulation order has been in force for less than six months, a joint labour committee may submit proposals for revoking or amending the order where it is satisfied that the order contains an error, or where exceptional circumstances exist that warrant the revocation or amendment.  Section 9 provides for the making of an ERO by the Minister.  Following adoption of a proposal for an ERO by the Labour Court, the proposals will be forwarded to the Minister who shall make an order giving effect to the proposals.  The standard legislative provision dealing with the laying of the order before the Oireachtas by the Minister will apply.  Section 9 also provides that the introduction of the new procedure will not detract from the validity of an existing ERO made before the commencement of the legislation.</P>
        <P>Section 10 provides for the amendment of the definition of a worker under section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to allow officers of VECs, other than teachers, access to the dispute settling agencies.  Section 10 also provides for the deletion of sections 23(2), 23(5) and 23(6) of the 1990 Act.  Section 23(5) provides that the Government may by order amend the definition of a worker in section 23(1) and may by order revoke or amend any such order.  Section 23(6) deals with the laying of such orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The effect of these amendments is to remove the power to make changes in the definition of worker by ministerial order and to ensure, in line with the decision in the case of Mulcreevy <i>v.</i> the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, that future changes in the definition of a worker will be made by primary legislation.  The Industrial Relations Act of 1990 (Definition of &ldquo;Worker&rdquo;) Order of 1998, S.I. No. 264 of 1998, amended the definition of a worker in section 23(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to give officers of local authorities, including health boards, access to the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and Rights Commissioners.  Since it is considered unsafe to rely on changes made to statute by secondary legislation, it is now proposed to make the amendment in primary legislation.  The definition of a local authority contained in section 23(2) of the 1990 Act should be deleted as a consequence.</P>
        <P>Section 11 provides for improved procedures to be followed when formulating proposals for an ERO.  The current legislation merely requires that, when proposals for the making of an ERO are being forwarded to the Labour Court, the JLC chairman must submit a report to the court on the circumstances surrounding their adoption by the JLC.  The Bill provides that, in future, the chairman of the JLC shall forward to the Labour Court copies of all written submissions and any other documentation considered by the JLC in formulating its proposals, in addition to a report on the circumstances surrounding their adoption.  The Labour Court will examine the material forwarded to it in considering the JLC&rsquo;s proposals and may hold a hearing where there are objections to the proposals.</P>
        <P>Section 12 provides that the term of office of a chairman of a JLC shall not exceed five years and shall cease to hold office on attaining the age of 65 years.  An existing JLC chairman shall hold office for no longer than three years following the enactment of the legislation.  Section 13 provides for consequential amendments to the Employment Permits Act 2006 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.</P><Col N="50"/>
        <P>I wish to highlight several matters in respect of which I intend to bring forward particular amendments on Committee Stage.  In addition to proceeding with legislative proposals to strengthen the existing JLC system and the operation of REAs as outlined in the Bill, I propose to introduce amendments to provide for a mechanism to enable employers to seek a temporary exemption from the strict application of EROs and REAs under certain conditions.  This should go some way towards balancing the current demands of both trade unions and employers by continuing to modernise and streamline the JLC system and to strengthen the legal status of REAs, while also alleviating the pressures that employers in these sectors currently experience under both systems as a consequence of the absence of a mechanism for processing claims for &ldquo;inability to pay&rdquo;.  In the course of the debate in the Seanad, I gave an assurance that the proposed provision would not be a <i>carte blanche </i>for derogation from the minimum wages and conditions prescribed in employment regulation orders.  The appropriate safeguards and procedures will be put in place to protect the rights of the workers affected.</P>
        <P>Second, I propose to introduce a further amendment to give the Labour Court the power to decide any questions arising as to the interpretation of the provisions of an employment regulation order or registered employment agreement or the application of such instruments to any particular person or business.  This new provision will subsume some existing provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, with coverage extended to enable the Labour Court to provide for the first time an authoritative interpretation of the scope of employment regulation orders.  The purpose of this provision will be to secure clarity as to the entitlements of the employees concerned under employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.  Such orders and agreements affect significant numbers of employees and a lack of clarity about the entitlements of employees and the responsibility of their employers can pose problems for businesses, employee representatives and the authorities.  The Labour Court has the necessary expertise to provide the required clarity.</P>
        <P>Third, concerns have been raised that workers who have retired from employment can find themselves excluded from access to the employment rights redress machinery in respect of matters that arose while they were in employment.  When this matter was raised on Committee Stage in the Seanad, I indicated that I was sympathetic to the view that the requirements of good employment practice would dictate that retired people should have a facility whereby grievances arising from their former employment relationship might be examined on their merits.  I have, accordingly, raised this matter with the Attorney General and I am exploring how such a proposal might best be facilitated.  In my view it is only reasonable that there should be some practical limitation on the scope for bringing claims relating to past events or understandings in the form of a time limit on the bringing of such claims.  I am hopeful that we can find a satisfactory solution to this problem in the course of the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the D&aacute;il, and I look forward to the input of Deputies on the issue.</P>
        <P>The overall purpose of this Bill, together with the Employment Law Compliance Bill, which has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and is awaiting further consideration on Committee Stage, is to secure greatly increased public confidence in the system of compliance and to strengthen and uphold the established employment rights bodies against legal challenge.  With this Bill, the Government is continuing to meet its commitment to advance a range of employment rights measures and to update our industrial relations legislative code to ensure the responsiveness of our industrial relations machinery to changes in the labour market, and to the immediate challenges facing the economy.</P>
        <P>I thank Members for their patience with the industrial relations alphabet that governs Bills such as this.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure if that is enough time but I will do my best.  I have a great deal to say about this Bill.  Perhaps the Chair will advise me when I reach 29 minutes.</P>
        <P>The Bill deals principally with the procedures used to enact employment regulation orders, EROs, and registered employment agreements, REAs, into law and make them legally binding.  There are some miscellaneous provisions in the Bill which give HSE workers, local authority staff and non-teaching staff of VECs access to the rights commissioner, Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and the Labour Court.  I have no objection to that aspect of the Bill and do not propose to comment on it in detail.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has given an indication that he might accept the amendment proposed by Senator Ryan in the Seanad relating to retired and former workers.  I would support that amendment and hope the advice from the Attorney General is favourable in that regard.</P>
        <P>Providing for HSE workers, local authority staff and non-teaching VEC staff to have access to rights commissioners shows how disjointed and disorganised our entire labour rights system is.  It is an alphabet jungle.  I do not understand why some workers can go to a rights commissioner and others cannot.  If one was setting up this system from scratch, one would have just one body to enforce labour law, although it might be necessary to have separate entities for the equality aspects.  That same body would deal with workers&rsquo; complaints.  Above that one would establish some type of quasi-judicial system which would hear appeals.  This Bill does not change the fact that some people can access the rights commissioner service and others cannot.  Teaching staff in VECs still cannot access that service.  One might say that the unions do not want them to, but that does not matter.  Why should there be different laws for the same people?</P>
        <P>In our system we have the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for labour in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the National Employment Rights Authority which enforces the EROs, REAs and the minimum wage.  We have the rights commissioner service, which is part of the Labour Relations Commission and which hears complaints relating to fixed term issues, working time issues, unfair dismissal, minimum wage, payment of wages and transfer of undertakings.  We then have the LRC, which has a slightly different job, and the Labour Court, which has a different job again.  Its job is sometimes judicial and sometimes not.  Sometimes it gives determinations and at other times it gives advisories.  It also runs the JLC system.  On top of that there is the National Implementation Body, which has various roles, and an Employment Appeals Tribunal, which has another set of roles.  One can take unfair dismissal and redundancy cases to the tribunal, if one has not taken them to one of the other bodies already.</P>
        <P>The entire system needs to be cleaned up, and I know the Minister long enough to believe that he probably agrees with me.  I hope that as Minister of State with responsibility for labour he will clean up that alphabet jungle.  I will not even mention the Equality Tribunal.  The system is confusing for workers and exposes employers, often unfairly, to multiple claims.  Deputy Fahey has drawn attention to the extent of claim shopping by people.  The entire area requires a total overhaul and the miscellaneous amendments in this Bill demonstrate that.  The Bill might be extending the rights commissioner service to some workers but it is still barred to others.  There are some recommendations on this issue in the McCarthy report but I do not agree with them.  However, the issue must be addressed and this Bill is a lost opportunity to do so.  I will come back to this on another occasion.</P>
        <P>I will now focus on issues relating to employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.  It is interesting that the constitutionality of the current system was first questioned by Mr. Justice Henchy in 1979, the year I was born.  I believe the Minister is only <Col N="52"/>a little older than me.  This issue has been floating around for a long time; it has taken 30 years to bring this legislation to the Oireachtas.  Of course, it follows a case taken by the Irish Hotels Federation and an ongoing case in the courts involving the Quick Service Food Alliance.  It should not be a surprise to anybody that what has been happening for the last 30, or even 50, years with employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements has been unconstitutional and therefore unlawful, although I do not know why it has taken so long to introduce legislation to clear up the matter.  However, this Bill does not do that.  Unfortunately, it is a reaction to the cases now before the courts.  It is also minimalist, and a lost opportunity to overhaul the system.</P>
        <P>The JLC, ERO and REA system needs to be totally overhauled.  It is laden with anomalies, inconsistencies and absurdities.  Take the example of the hotel employment regulation order.  I am aware that the two JLCs have been merged.  That aside, the employment regulation order for the hotel sector applies to County Dublin but not to Dublin city, for example, it applies to a hotel in Fingal in my constituency or to a hotel in the airport but it does not apply to a hotel in Tallaght.  The Acting Chairman will note that I have mentioned Tallaght in this debate.  It does not apply to a hotel in town, a hotel in Killiney and a hotel in Dundrum, if it is in the old borough of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  This order does not apply to Dublin city, the old borough of D&uacute;n Laoghaire or the city of Cork but it does apply to County Cork, County Kerry and County Dublin.  That is ridiculous, and it should be addressed in the Bill.</P>
        <P>If one examines contract cleaning for example, the order applies differently in Dublin city than in Dublin county.  In fact, Dublin county does not exist any more, in legal terms, except for the purposes of the Labour Court and the VEC.  That does not make any sense either because I live in Dublin and know that contract cleaners go to different parts of the greater Dublin area all the time.  It is absurd that a different set of employment regulation orders applies to cleaners when they are in Blanchardstown as opposed to Chapelizod, which is in the city but is only three miles away.  I am not sure if it applies to where they do the work or where their workplace is based.  It is a very bizarre system.</P>
        <P>If one looks at catering, there is something similar.  There is one set of catering rules for Dublin city and D&uacute;n Laoghaire; for the rest of the county, including Fingal and south Dublin there is a different set.  For hairdressing, there is one set of rules for Cork city.  There is also a different set for Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Bray, but in the rest of the country there is no hairdressing employment regulation order at all.  For example, one set of rules applies in Bray, which are the same as apply in Killiney, but they do not apply in Arklow.  I do not understand that; it is absurd.  If it took the Government 30 years to write this Bill, it could have done a better job and included some measures to deal with those issues.</P>
        <P>If the Minister of State does not know what hairdressing is, in this Schedule &ldquo;hairdressing&rdquo; includes the following operations performed on hair growing on the head, face or neck of a male or female person, that is to say, lathering, shaving, cutting, singeing, shampooing, waving, setting, dressing, tinting, dyeing, bleaching or similar operations &mdash; I am not sure what similar operations are.</P>

	<P>I am glad I was here for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>When it comes to hairdressing it is even more complicated because the minimum rate which a hairdresser gets is &euro;0.06 an hour more if he or she is cutting a woman&rsquo;s hair than if he or she is cutting a man&rsquo;s hair, but if he or she cuts unisex hair he or she is paid the male rate.  I do not know what unisex hair is or whether there has to be a particular balance in terms of how many men or women one sees in a salon or barbershop, but <Col N="53"/>that is the law.  The Minister of States wants such a law to be made by this House.  Whatever about the Labour Court making stupid laws, I hope this House does not make a law like that.</P>
        <P>As I said, it only applies in some parts of the country and not in others.  It gets even stranger.  There is also the retail and grocery employment regulation order which applies to the retail, grocery and allied trades.  What is retail?  It does not include a lamp shop or a clothes shop.  It only includes shops where food is sold, but not all types of food.  If the only food one sells is bread or confectionery made only from bread, then the order does not apply.  If one sells beef it does not count.  If one is a beef butcher, one is not covered by the regulation, unless one sells pressed beef.  If one does not sell beef but sells pork, fish and venison it does not apply.  After 30 years the Government might have come up with a Bill which might address something like that.  It applies to tobacconists, cigar, cigarette and cigarillo sellers, snuff sellers and sellers of smokers&rsquo; requisites, but not to independent off-licences.</P>
        <P>Needless to say, there are some strange regional variations and some very strange rules as to where it does apply.  In the case of Butlers Cafe it did not apply when it was selling chocolate because apparently that is not food, but when it had chairs to allow people to attend the cafe it then became a cafe and fell under the catering order.  It does not apply to pubs which do not sell food but it does apply to pubs which do sell food, unless it is a sandwich which one eats at the bar, in which case it does not apply.</P>
        <P>There are similar issues regarding petrol stations.  If it starts serving food and allows people to sit down it becomes a catering establishment, and that also applies to people who only sell petrol.  There are other examples.  There are different rates for tailors and dressmakers compared to shirtmakers.  I will not talk about the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker because the butcher and baker do not come under this system unless they sell beef &mdash; I do not know where the candlestick maker falls but I do not think he or she is involved.</P>
        <P>The system does not deal just with minimum pay rates.  There has been a focus on pay rates in this matter, which is not the issue at all.  By and large the minimum rates are not much above the existing minimum wage with, perhaps, the exception of the security industry.  They apply to various areas involving terms and conditions, which is where things get quite complicated.  It is not clear to me &mdash; the Minister of State might explain this at some point &mdash; if the ability to pay clause will apply to the minimum rates or if it will also apply to premium pay, overtime and the fact one can only work every second Sunday after St. Swithin&rsquo;s Day and before Christmas Day.  Those aspects of the EROs and REAs are what really cause the problems, with the exception of some employers who do not want to pay their workers anything at all &mdash; I have no sympathy with them.  I am interested in knowing whether the inability to pay clause or the hardship clause, as the Minister of State is now calling it, will apply to that.</P>
        <P>It also applies to other issues such as representation.  Some EROs give workers the right to be represented by their union, as they should be allowed to do, and is the case for that covering agricultural workers.  Others do not say anything about representation.  The case of electricians is the most bizarre.  I appreciate it is an REA and not an ERO, but the REA for electricians requires that they must be members of the TEU and that the employer must collect their dues.  It is one thing to prevent people from being a member of a union but it is another to say they cannot work unless they are a member.  That issue needs to be addressed in this Bill.</P>
        <P>Some EROs and REAs give people the right to compassionate pay, others do not.  Some allow sick pay, others do not.  In the case of sick pay in the retail sector, one has to give notice of an hour and a half, but in hairdressing one has to give notice before noon.  Some deal with breaks, others do not.  Some ensure that workers have pensions, others do not.  Some deal with the issue of premium pay.  For example, the retail sector gives anything between time and a third and time and a half but hotels give only time and a third.</P><Col N="54"/>
        <P>Others deal with working times.  For example, the hotel regulations prevent anyone from working more than 12 hours in one day even though he or she may wish to.  Many of us have done it.  It might suit one to work a 14 hour day one day and nothing the next day, but that is illegal.  This Bill does not change that.  It also requires that hotel workers get every second Sunday off during the off season.  It might suit somebody to be a hotel worker who only works Sundays and does so during the off season, yet we are saying that should be a crime in this State.  I do not see why we would ever want to enforce a system like that.  Others deal with annual leave and facilities.  For example, the security ERO requires that the employer provide access to a canteen, stove or the means of heating food, which is a very good thing but I am not sure if employers who do not provide it should be prosecuted.  However, they should be under the existing law.</P>
        <P>After 30 years of court cases and a period of time in which the Government could have addressed this issue we should not be discussing a minimalist Bill which will just about get the Government around some court cases which are currently taking place.  There should be a total overhaul of the ERO and REA system.  If it did not happen 30 years ago it should at least have happened in 1997 when the National Minimum Wage Act was passed.  Let us not have people in five years time saying a Bill went through the D&aacute;il five years ago and it did not deal with it.  Why do we not deal with this Bill now?</P>
        <P>If I had been asked a question on EROs and REAs two years ago I would have had a different opinion.  I probably would have said JLCs should be abolished, there should be no system and we should just have a national minimum wage and various other protections, and leave it at that.  I no longer take that view because, with the exception of REAs which, by and large, cover very well-paid workers, the EROs cover workers who are generally poor, uneducated and unorganised, and many of whom are foreign nationals.  There is a necessity to have a supplementary means of protection for such workers to ensure they are not exploited, as they would be if we reduced them to the bare minimum rights allowable by law.</P>
        <P>The system does not work and needs to be radically overhauled.  First of all, it should be genuinely representative.  With all due respect to the officials who sit on JLCs, they are officials, and very often they are union officials who represent workers who are not unionised and who were not elected by them.  There are officials from the employer organisations who have never run a hotel or restaurant in their lives but who are just officials.  JLCs should be properly representative. </P>
        <P>The chairman should not have voting rights.  I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement that he has made the point that on many occasions in recent times the chairman&rsquo;s casting vote was not used, but there is a dynamic in all of this.  This is not my view, rather, it is that of the people who have researched this area, namely, O&rsquo;Sullivan <i>et al</i>.  There is a perception that many of the chairmen tend to favour one side rather than the other and that, of course, changes behaviour because people will not push their case if they think the chairman will come down against them.  If one had an independent chairman who was a conciliator, rather than a judge, one would have genuine agreements rather than ones that are imposed, sometimes because one side fears the potential bias of a chairman.</P>
        <P>We should require that the chairman be professional and qualified.  That is not provided for in the legislation.  Essentially it is an appointment that is in the Minister&rsquo;s gift.  That should not be the case.  There should be criteria requiring that they have some qualifications, possibly a former rights commissioner, but that is not in the legislation.  They should have a national application.  As I mentioned earlier I do not understand why they apply to some parts of the country and not to others, sometimes to parts of counties and not to others.  I think they should <Col N="55"/>be limited in their remit.  In some cases they cover areas that should not be legally enforced.  It may be well to say that things should be done by agreement but making it legally mandatory that somebody has certain things in their toolbox should not be the law.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">This legislation should be amended to define more tightly the areas to which an ERO or an REA may or may not apply.  All of this should form part of an overall modernisation of our labour law.  We should have a consolidated employment law Bill which would be much easier to compile than the consolidated company law Bill.  The Minister of State can take as long as he wishes to do that so far as I am concerned.  The employment law Bill could be done quite quickly.  That consolidated Bill should enhance the existing body of rights that are currently applied to all employees.  For example, everyone should have sick pay; everyone should have access to a pension; everyone should have some form of break system.  Arguably, everyone should receive some form of premium pay on Sundays.  New legislation should be introduced to provide those rights that are currently enjoyed by some people, covered by EROs but not others, to everyone.  We need to consolidate all those different structures to which I have referred, the alphabet of agencies rather than the alphabet of orders and agreements as there are too many of them.  It is not in anyone&rsquo;s interest, other than the people who are on them, to have so many.  There should be major consolidation in that area.  The Minister of State is probably looking at the UK model as an example of how to do it more efficiently.  Above all, we need to fit this into a new social contract, one that says to everyone in society that they will have access to health insurance and to a defined benefit pension.  That is the kind of reform, if one goes back to 1946, that after 64 years, we should be introducing today.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P Just="Left">In regard to the inability to pay clause, I support it but I have concerns about it.  As I mentioned, it is not clear whether it will apply just to rates or to all those other aspects such as premium pay, overtime, how many Sundays one can work in a row, whether one has to be a member of a union whether one wishes or not.  I would like to know if the inability to pay clause or the hardship clause will apply to those issues as well as to the minimum rates.  I am concerned that the Labour Court will find itself inundated by cafes, restaurants, hotels who will come to it with their books stating they are making a loss and cannot afford to pay.  That would put the Labour Court in a position where it would have to grant them a hardship clause which will then create an unfair competitive disadvantage for those who are just getting by or turning a small profit.  In many ways that has the potential to undermine the whole system.  Perhaps it is the intention of the Government that this vision is a Trojan horse through which it will bring down the whole system but it will do it by stealth.  If that is the Government&rsquo;s intention why not withdraw this Bill, start again and address not just this one issue that is before the House because of what is going on in the courts but all the issues I have mentioned in my contribution and overhaul these industrial relations Acts?  I think we have some time at least to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity on behalf of the Labour Party to contribute to the debate on the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009.  While we broadly welcome the thrust of some of the legislation we have grave concerns, some of which I will articulate on behalf of our party.  What one would expect is that we would examine this legislation very carefully.  We must have support on a number of issues regarding the imposition of a constitutional floor.  In asserting the primacy of the Oireachtas there is too much delegation of powers taking place.  Such power is being hived off to everyone except the Oireachtas.  Deputy Varadkar is correct in saying that in 1979 Mr. Justice Henchy referred to this in a court case.  It is mind boggling that it has taken in excess of 30 years for this to take place.</P>
        <P>The Bill makes provision for the promotion of a harmonious environment from the industrial relations viewpoint that prevails between workers and their employees and amends and extends <Col N="56"/>the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004 and makes amendments to the Employment Permits Act 2006 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  As the Minister and Deputy Varadkar have said the Bill is one of a number of such legislative proposals that has its origin in the context of the Towards 2016 review and the transitional arrangements covered in the period 2008-9 which come into being as a result of arrangements between the Government and the social partners which dealt with issues pertaining to employment rights and compliance chapters of their agreements.  The Bill also focuses on the need to strengthen the arrangement for the making of the employment regulation orders and the registered employment agreements that has been a familiar part of the industrial landscape for more than six decades.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P Just="Left">In recent times a number of cases taken at High Court level have sought to challenge the constitutional standing of the legislative provisions which underpin the legal framework for the making of EROs and REAs.  It is incumbent on us to avail of this opportunity to update and modernise the procedures, principles and policies which joint labour committees must have regard to in formulating these legislative tools and which are extremely important for sectors where wages were clearly low.  I am glad to hear Deputy Varadkar say this.  I salute him even though, two years ago, he started off with the opposite view; such an admission is a sign of a good politician.  My own view has not changed.  As a member of a party which can stretch its lineage back to 1913, we should never cede, without a fight, some of those rights which were hard won on the backs of those great workers in 1913.   I salute the then Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, for the work he did in 1966.  One can applaud what he did.  There is the issue of dismantling the low paid wage structure, whether the minimum wage of &euro;8.65 or the JLCs, the EROs or whatever, the people who are already poorly paid by definition.  This was put in place to insure against expectation, to put in place a floor for people who worked hard by the sweat of their brow, often in labour intensive areas.  One has to be vigilant.  Putting in place the inability to pay clause, the exemption clause or whatever, could be the start of a slippery slope, against which I caution.  Indeed, the party of which I am a member wants to caution the Government against embarking on this area.</P>
         <P Just="Left">I note the recent Government discussions in respect of the work to rule being embarked on by the workers who feel strongly about the recent impositions in respect of pension levies, wages cuts and so, particularly in the public service.  I caution the Government not to engage in infantile responses and not to threaten the stoppage of union contributions at source.  We do not want a reversal to 1913 tactics.  The sweat of the labourer won hard battles.  Union contributions are important.  Trade unions have been subject to much adverse criticism recently.  Is the Minister of State trying to tell me that had they not been in place over the past 15 or 20 years there would not have been widespread and untramelled exploitation?  Is the Minister of State trying to tell me the unions did not make a very positive contribution to the growth and recovery of this economy since the mid-1980s?  Let nobody tell me they did not.  It is easy to lie at this point but we will not join that chorus.</P>
        <P>What I am worried about &mdash; Deputy Varadkar referred to it in a very important way &mdash; is that if we tackle the minimum pay issue, the JLCs and the EROs it is clear this will have implication for social welfare payment.  People talk about poverty traps and every other kind of situation.  That is the point.  People are struggling to survive and to make ends meet on their low pay and the present social welfare rates.  Are we to depress that floor further and leave those people virtually impoverished?  Neither I nor my Labour Party colleagues will join the chorus or be part of the drive to lower wages to close to unsustainable levels.</P>
       <P>I watched with interest the &ldquo;Frontline&rdquo; programme on which people outlined their views very clearly.  Some articulated the view that the minimum wage had to be driven down.  If, for example, the wages of a person aged 65, and close to the exit door, is driven down it would <Col N="57"/>save 65 cents per hour, or &euro;5.20 per day.  I know what goes on in business.  It is difficult and I appreciate the context.  Competitiveness is difficult.  However, if things are that close we will start a vicious cycle because that money is paid out by people who hope to get a return from it.  According to the circular theory of money, it will return to their tills.  If that is taken away we will have further deflation.</P>
        <P>I appreciate there must be some flexibility.  As Deputy Varadkar said, perhaps people might agree to work on Sundays, or if there is an obstacle to that taking place, it might be removed. I would be extremely concerned, as would my party, to join in this mad rush to try to dismantle the wage structure, particularly at minimum wage level and at the JLC or ERO levels.</P>
        <P>The system of employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements has been in force since 1946 and most EU countries have this type of system.  It is peculiar that in Britain the TUC is currently working with the Labour Party to have a similar system put in place.  The purpose of bringing in the legislation is to secure the operation of a system from attack, not to undermine it.  That is a very strong view as held by the Labour Party.  We must not undermine the system, we must protect it.  The relevance of these agreements is even more pronounced in today&rsquo;s financial crisis.  Their terms and conditions are automatically applicable to, and can be enforced against, contractors and service providers based outside the State but operating here.  As such these instruments ensure against unfair cross-Border competition, to which Deputy Varadkar alluded.  Without these agreements, what we will have is a free for all in which decent employers will be undermined.  That, of course, is what less than compliant employers would try to achieve.  The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, is a person in whom I have a great deal of faith and he would understand that well.</P>
        <P>Engaging in a wage competition, particularly a cross-Border one, would be devastating.  On the surface it might sound like a good strategy for an individual employer to seek competitive advantage by cutting workers&rsquo; wages but soon every employer would join in, all workers would have lower wages and be unable to afford to buy anything.  It is a zero sum game.  That is clear.  With a handful of honourable exceptions, if that were to start it would become a cascade and every employer would have to join.  If we learned nothing else in the recent crisis we learned that the market will always act for short-term gain at the expense of long-term sustainability.  My party wants to make that point very strongly.</P>
        <P>I shall refer to exemptions and the inability to pay clause and wish to refer to features of the Bill.  The Bill focuses on the need to strengthen the arrangement for making EROs and the registered employment agreements, REAs.  That is very important.  One notes that the Bill provides that the EROs and REAs will be given legal effect in future by way of ministerial order.  These instruments will be now subject to Oireachtas scrutiny.  In my view, they should be subject to input and amendment as proposed on the floor of the D&aacute;il, giving the House an effective form of oversight.  Input is vital to widen the democratic underpinning of the process.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that the JLCs are made up of representative employers and workers from particular sectors, with a chairperson appointed by the Minister.  There are 13 JLCs which meet and are required to discuss and agree the rates and conditions of employment to apply to workers in the different sectors.  They predated the concept of collective bargaining by some decades and therefore play an important role in putting in place a wages floor in certain sectors of the economy where wages tend to be lower than in others.  As the Minister of State pointed out, these are generally in the hospitality and retail sectors, contract cleaning and hairdressing.  I was enthused to learn from Deputy Varadkar the various strands in hairdressing.  I have a sister in law who is a hairdresser so it will be her weekend task to explain some of these points to me.</P><Col N="58"/>
        <P>As the Minister of State noted, there have been complaints by some firms operating certain EROs.  They signified they are experiencing difficulties in particular sectors.  One would hope the representative employers and employees who are participants on a JLC will take cognisance of any issues troubling that particular sector, especially at this time; that they will address and reflect upon these issues and the importance of employment maintaining reasonable wage rates which reflect the reality of the current economic environment.  That is the kind of consensus arrangement I would like to see.  I believe it has been achieved.</P>
        <P>There has been useful and very positive engagement of late in this regard, especially last autumn with the agreement reached at JLC level that dealt with the hotel and catering areas.  It specifically adjusted the premium rate payable from double the rate to one and one-third the rate.  That was very important in the area in question.  I know the Minister of State took this on board.  He heard about it when he was a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I was glad he consulted the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.  This pragmatism and reflection of the new realities was likewise reflected in the agricultural and retail sectors late last year &mdash;  in November and December &mdash; which facilitated the deferral of increases in minimum rates that would have been due in each of the sectors.  This proves there is no need to put in place a statutory exemption or inability to pay process.  The system is in place, is and has been extremely responsive and has shown itself to be so.  All it needs to work is for people to point out they are not able to pay and then work within the system.  Trade unions are well aware of this and have stated to the joint committee that they are very cognisant of the significant downturn and the difficulties presented.  They want to play a positive role in sustaining and retaining employment.</P>
        <P>Regarding the JLCs established in 1946, I want to pay tribute to the then Minister, Se&aacute;n Lemass, subsequently Taoiseach, who ensured their competence expanded beyond the fixing of minimum rate levels to allow them also to deal with the regulation of conditions of employment.  Likewise in 1946 the Labour Court assumed functions previously exercised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Therefore, when a JLC reached agreement on terms and conditions relevant to a particular sector it made proposals to the Labour Court which then made employment regulations orders.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Henchy referred to this in 1979, alluding to the position of the 1946 Act.  He basically established that this was constitutionally suspect, as it were.  He was important in asserting the primacy of the Oireachtas and I salute that.  It is very important that the Oireachtas is the decision-making body in respect of legislation, both primary and secondary.  The position that existed patently was legally suspect as evidenced when one examines the constitutional jurisprudence of similar delegations when they were challenged.  One notes that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is reassuming the power whereby he or she will make the relevant order on foot of the agreed proposals received from the JLCs through the Labour Court.  Under the legislative proposals we are debating, the Labour Court will have a more focused and supervisory role in regard to the functions delegated to the JLCs.</P>
        <P>The laying of a statutory instrument before the Houses of the Oireachtas is of paramount importance.  I have argued at every opportunity the importance of a statutory instrument coming before the Oireachtas in order for Members to have the opportunity to debate it, as they should.  I call for a debate to be held on every statutory instrument laid before the House, if only for 15 or 20 minutes.  This could happen in committee.  A statutory instrument might be laid before the Oireachtas and then formally transferred to a committee for debate.  That is important because it will allow Members to have an input.</P><Col N="59"/>
        <P>There is no point referring to European legislation, etc.  We have brought forward domestic legislation and people have sometimes known less about it than they did about the original European directives which gave rise to its introduction.  That is because they did not have the opportunity to participate and make positive suggestions with regard to improvements which might be made.</P>
        <P>REAs have been in force since 1946.  They are the outcome of a process of collective bargaining, which culminates in an agreement that can be presented to the Labour Court.  If satisfied with the contents and thrust of the proposals made in an REA, the court will duly register them.  This has the consequence of making an agreement legally enforceable in respect of the class, type or group of workers to which it applies.  Of course, an REA applies to everyone in a particular sector, irrespective of whether a worker or employer is party to it.  This gives rise to difficulties and may make these agreements subject to challenge in the future.  As a result of the far-reaching consequences of these agreements, the Minister is again assuming authority to make or vary agreements rather than allowing the Labour Court to act.</P>
        <P>Section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 contains a definition with regard to what constitutes a &ldquo;worker&rdquo;.  This is being amended in the Bill before the House, which allows workers other than teachers to have access to the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and the rights commissioner.  That widens the definition to which I refer and it is only, as Deputy Varadkar stated, achieving what should have been done in the past.  Henceforth, it will only be possible to change the definition further by means of primary legislation.  That is both important and correct.  It will get rid of the anachronism which permitted amendments and definitional changes to be affected simply by order.</P>
        <P>I recall that when I was a law student I was often bamboozled by the plethora of mechanisms that were available in respect of obtaining resolutions to disputes of various kinds and also by the archaic and arcane language that was used in legislation.  It is time we consolidated or codified the law as it relates to employment.  Such law is an absolute nightmare for a practitioner but for a student it is doubly so.  It would be to the benefit of everyone &mdash; students, practitioners, employers and employees &mdash; if the law was consolidated.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State proposes the introduction of the inability to pay mechanism in order to put in place a counterbalance to existing statutory wage fixing procedures.  During one of his first public outings &mdash; I seem to recall it was on home territory at the MacGill summer school &mdash; the Minister of State made a foray into the realm of industrial relations and promised this amendment to take cognisance of the serious difficulties employers have indicated they are experiencing under REAs and EROs.</P>
        <P>I accept that difficulties exist but it appears to be one-way traffic in this regard.  I do not live in an ivory tower and I am aware that such difficulties &mdash; which were outlined to the committee of which I am Chairman &mdash; can arise.  However, there does not appear to have been any trade union input into the legislation.  During his contribution, the Minister of State undermined his own arguments when he illustrated vividly, clearly and concisely how consensus and agreement came about in respect of particular sectors and when he indicated that certain employers were not obliged to pay the required amounts laid down under the terms of EROs, in particular.</P>
        <P>The inability to pay amendment provides that an employer can apply to the Labour Court for an exemption from the requirements of an ERO or REA in line with section 41 of the National Minimum Wage Act.  As I understand it, trade unions have not been involved in any discussions in respect of this matter and they would not be happy with any proposal to agree the inability to pay exemption.  The unions are concerned with regard to the proposal and believe it to be misguided in its conception.  They note that allowing exemptions will encourage and reward unfair cost competition because companies will tender &mdash; even in respect of public <Col N="60"/>procurement &mdash; on the basis of those exemptions.  This will have the effect of increasing every company&rsquo;s inability to pay because if a company factors into its tender the full rate relating to an REA or ERO, it will be placed at a disadvantage when compared to a company which has an exemption.  I refer in this regard to security, catering and cleaning companies in particular.</P>
        <P>This is a matter of grave importance.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State is trying to deal with a problem at one end of the scale.  However &mdash; and I do not intend to be a smart aleck in saying this &mdash; in doing so he may create a major imbalance at the other end.  Ultimately, this could lead to huge problems arising.  While he is trying to save jobs at one end, he may create a cascade of unemployment at the other.</P>
        <P>The safeguard that an employer will only be granted an exemption once can be avoided by recasting a company and thus easily disguising repeat applications for exemptions.  This is a matter of concern, particularly in view of the position relating to contracting and subcontracting practices and the &ldquo;phoenix&rdquo; syndrome &mdash; which was discussed by members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Mr. Paul Appleby, the Director of Corporate Enforcement last week &mdash; that apply in respect of the construction sector.</P>
        <P>The likely method to be proposed in respect of establishing an inability to pay will be that the Labour Court must be satisfied that an employer is unable to pay and would be likely to lay off workers or terminate their contracts.  As a result, it will be much easier for contractors in poorer EU member states to establish an inability to pay and this could give rise to unfair and inappropriate cross-border competition.  A great deal of consideration must be given to this aspect of the matter.</P>
        <P>Any safeguards which might be put in place would be a sham and could be easily avoided.  If the proposal is to provide that the majority of workers will be obliged to agree to the exemption, it will offer little protection in employments where there is no trade union representation.  What will happen in such circumstances?  It is easy to imagine the type of pressure that could be exerted on workers to agree to their employers being given exemptions.  For example, in a firm with 20 employees, 12 may be in agreement with seeking an exemption while the other eight may not.  What will happen then?  The answer is that those who oppose the exemption would still be obliged to agree with its being sought or else they could become isolated.</P>
        <P>The Minister may or may not include a limit on the amount below that contained in an ERO or REA which the Labour Court will exempt an employer from paying or providing.  There are particular concerns with regard to how reductions or outright exemptions will interact with pension obligations and other entitlements set down in agreements.  What will inform an inability to pay exemption application?  What will such an application cover?  Will it be premium rates, overtime rates or other rates?</P>
        <P>It is worth making the point that REAs are collective agreements for the purposes of international law and, as such, are protected by International Labour Organisation, ILO, conventions.  Governments must refrain from undercutting or undermining the activity of workers joining together to pursue the common goals of negotiating conditions and terms of employment.  The ILO has found that interventions by the legislative and administrative authorities which have the effect of annulling or modifying the content of freely concluded collective agreement, including wage clauses, are contrary to the principles of voluntary collective bargaining.  It would be better if the Government promoted collective bargaining &mdash; as it is required to do by the ILO &mdash; rather than undermining it.</P>
        <P>As already stated, there has been negative commentary in respect of trade unions only looking after themselves, etc.  However, I am of the view that they are correct to highlight the issues <Col N="61"/>to which I refer.  Under the agreements in question, all workers &mdash; even those who are afraid to join trade unions &mdash; benefit.  That is why employers are sometimes so opposed to them.</P>
        <P>There are many elements which must be taken into account in respect of this matter.  I am aware, for example, of the principles that will come into play in respect of section 8 and of which JLCs will be obliged to have cognisance.  I applaud the developments that are proposed in this regard because it is about time that transparency was introduced.  It is good that these principles are being outlined in statutory form.  Everyone&rsquo;s cards will be on the table in the future and this will make matters so much easier.  I congratulate the Minister of State on what is being done in this regard.</P>
        <P>I have a number of concerns in respect of the legislation.  However, one of these has been laid to rest as a result of the judgment in the case of Mulcreevy <i>v</i>. the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which states that all future changes in the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; will, as I previously pointed out, have to be made by means of primary legislation.</P>
        <P>Section 11 sets out the improved procedures to be followed when formulating proposals for an ERO.  Henceforth, the chairman of a JLC shall forward to the Labour Court, in addition to a report on the circumstances surrounding the adoption of such proposals, copies of all written submissions and all or any other documentation considered by that JLC in formulating its proposals.  In the future, the Labour Court will be obliged to consider the material forwarded to it when it is considering JLC proposals and may hold hearings at which objections to such proposals may be raised.  That is an important development.</P>
        <P>Section 12 indicates that the term of office of the chairman shall be five years and that he or she shall be obliged to retire at 65.  That is as it should be.</P>
        <P>It should always be remembered that EROs and REAs are enshrined in domestic law and that our laws governing the application of the minimum wage are in accordance with the principles of the Lisbon treaty.  These agreements are basic and fundamental employment standards under the relevant EU directive. They are therefore directly applicable to and are capable of being enforced against contractors outside the State.  It is important that we do not now take a step that would undermine the basis of what has been achieved and which was very important in terms of what was set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>Why is there a differentiation in the applicability of JLCs across the country in determining the appropriate redress in a particular sector so that the same rate in that sector would apply in Mayo, Westmeath and Cork as applies in Dublin?  This is one of the great mysteries.  Everything that adds complexity gives an opportunity for it to be undermined or attacked.  The more we simplify matters such as this the more progress will be made and the more acceptable it will be.  While I know the Minister of State has much work to do, I urge him to review the matter sometime.  As Deputy Varadkar said, this might have been an opportunity to adopt a uniform mechanism across the country.  Arguments have been made over the years that it costs more to live in a city.  From my knowledge of people coming up from my area, I can understand where that comes from.  It is a matter that needs to be reviewed.</P>
        <P>I believe some 67 registered employment agreements, REAs, are maintained by the Labour Court.  I would love to know how many of these have ever been examined or reviewed in the past five or six years.  We know that the JLCs predated the introduction of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  I would like to see a survey of the JLC rates that govern EROs and compare and contrast them with the current minimum wage of &euro;8.65.  That would be an interesting exercise.  The vast majority of them are slightly above 60 cent and may be &euro;1 at most.</P>
        <P>I referred to Article 27 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Lisbon treaty which enshrined the right to collective bargaining.  I would be very wary and cautious about taking any steps that would undermine that provision.</P><Col N="62"/>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar mentioned the separate JLCs in the catering sector, one for the greater Dublin area and one for elsewhere.  I know they are to be merged.  However, last Sunday in the course of a wide-ranging review the Taoiseach indicated that labour unit costs had reduced by 7%.  I am sure I heard him rightly.  That is the prediction and it is important for competitiveness for the small and medium-sized industries whose cause we have always supported.  Many small businesses and shops providing two or three jobs are vital to those areas.  Two or three jobs in a small rural village is like a factory employing 30, 40 or 50 people; they represent the lifeblood of those areas.  Keeping people in those areas is vital and ensures the viability and sustainability of the churches, schools, the football, soccer, rugby and hockey teams, and all the things that go to sustain rural infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Given that there has already been a significant reduction, which is very important for international competitiveness, the country needs to get back exporting.  We have had the Forf&aacute;s report which the Minister of State has studied.  We are now going the right way.  We need to ask whether this is a race to the bottom.  Will it be a zero-sum gain with all the pain carried by workers who have very little more to give and have given much already?  It must be recognised that they paid a pivotal and constructive role in economic recovery from 1987 onwards.  Many of them are still playing a constructive role in that they are paying whatever is left of their wages in exorbitant mortgages they secured to pay the outlandish prices for houses.  Having done that we are now asking them to consider taking off another 50 cent, 60 cent or &euro;1 per hour.  This is an area in which we must tread very warily.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill, which represents an important and quite speedy resolution of issues regarding registered employment agreements and employment regulation orders, and the High Court.  It is better for the Government to pre-empt any possible challenges to the work and remit of the High Court rather than face the possibility of the system being jeopardised in a sudden manner.</P>
        <P>Other speakers have spoken about the two mechanisms with which this Bill is concerned, the employment regulation orders, EROs, and registered employment agreements, REAs.  They remain very important in our overall industrial relations landscape although they are somewhat anachronistic.  In 1909 Winston Churchill said &ldquo;where... you have no organisation, no parity of bargaining, the good employer is undercut by the bad and the bad employer is undercut by the worst&rdquo;.  They are important mechanisms for those in the services sector, particularly those on low pay and many who are without union representation.  The joint labour committees, for example, are important in providing a forum in which employers and worker representatives can hammer out difficulties of worker conditions in a way that prevents a race to the bottom but also takes account of the difficulties in particular sectors.  The hotel sector is a good case in point.  That sector saw a dramatic loss in business owing to the global downturn, but had very specific rates of pay for people working on Sundays and bank holidays.</P>
        <P Just="Left">They are also important because many of the non-Irish workers in our labour market are in the services sector.  The impact of REAs and EROs is such that it can help prevent our foreign nationals from being exploited by employers here.  The work of NERA in enforcing the conditions laid down by these mechanisms is vital.  I commend NERA, which is based in my constituency, and Ger Deering its director on its ongoing work to protect people in employment.</P><Col N="63"/>
        <P>The main proposals in the Bill are necessary and welcome, particularly the sections dealing with ways to strengthen the legitimacy of REAs and EROs through Oireachtas supervision.  Specification of the principles and policies that must be considered by the JLCs in regard to their work is also welcome, as is the proposal for the process of JLC consideration of all submissions, which should ensure that the Labour Court takes all objections and points into consideration before approving any JLC recommendations.</P>
        <P>During the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas the Minister of State might consider amending the age limit at which chairpersons of JLCs must retire.  The legislation proposes that the independent chairperson will cease to hold office at 65 years of age.  There is no reason a chair should not continue until the age of 70.  As a society we are trying to avoid ageism.  I know the county is facing aging demographics.  If someone is fit and well why should 70 not be the cut-off point?  The Minister for Finance recently stated that he envisages the retirement age being increased.  As many people now work until 70, the age limit could be re-examined.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the proposal to ensure any amendment to the definition of worker is not the sole preserve of the Minister.  Amendments to the definition should be done through primary legislation.</P>
        <P>I shall conclude by reiterating a point I made in the debate in this House on the Employment Law and Compliance Bill about the need for a wider reform of the State&rsquo;s architecture for dealing with workers&rsquo; avenues for redress.  We have the Labour Court, NERA, the Rights Commissioner, the Health and Safety Authority, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Equality Authority as well as the various Departments.  At a time when Government is looking to streamline and do its business in a lean, mean way, an important step would be a meaningful review of these processes to see if a simpler avenue for appeal and redress can be found for workers.  I welcome and support this Bill and look forward to watching it wend its way through the House.  I commend it to the House this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to this Bill.  I compliment the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, on their work with the Bill to date.  The new Minister of State has been only a short time in the job, but he has read himself into the position well and is making an impact as he facilitates all sides of the debate. </P>
        <P>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009 is part of a suite of measures, one of which, the Employment Law Compliance Act, is in place.  The proposed inability to pay clause has garnered more headlines than any of the Bill&rsquo;s other provision.  It has been widely misrepresented and misread.  Contrary to popular belief, inability to pay clauses are not new.  They already exist, as instanced by the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, and have always featured in national pay agreements.  However, they have never been invoked.</P>
        <P>The mechanism is now being considered as regards joint labour committees, JLCs, and registered employment agreements, REAs, in response to difficulties in certain sectors.  We are well aware of such difficulties in the past 18 months.  They have arisen as regards the various working directives and orders for the city of Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and the rest of the country.  That clearly was unfair and something of an anomaly for people in business.  It was very difficult for them to understand why this should be so.  Again, I compliment all concerned, including the Minister of State, in having that anomaly sorted out.</P>
        <P>To depart somewhat from the Bill, there are many other areas that affect business, which is the spice of life.  We have to promote and support our businesses as best we can in all areas in addition to the legislation before us.  Costs, such as electricity, rates charged by county councils, fuel bills, water charges both in and outside business, present major impediments and are <Col N="64"/>forcing people out of business.  Wages are only a small part of the overall picture.  Health and safety aspects are another consideration.</P>
        <P>Another major issue is the unfair dismissals claims being taken against many companies by the &ldquo;newcomers&rdquo; from abroad who played an important role in many Irish businesses, not least in the rural economy, in horticulture, construction and catering.  These sectors would not have survived in the Celtic tiger interlude without the services provided by these people.  However, in too many cases, there have been claims of unfair dismissal and this is a major burden for businesses, large or small.  Then there is the whole area of bank charges.</P>
        <P>We saw the serious action last week of the air traffic controllers.  Serious legislation is needed to prohibit and prevent small groups like this from causing such havoc.  Mechanisms and channels are in place to negotiate all such grievances but no group should have the power to literally bring the country to a standstill.  Ireland is an island enormously dependent on its airports in particular, as well as its sea ports. Some 20,000 people were inconvenienced and this is not acceptable in these modern times.  I appeal to the Government to bring forward legislation to deal with this type of situation.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to protect the most vulnerable workers in particular, by ensuring that existing mechanisms for making employment regulation orders, EROs, and REAs are fit for purpose and operate effectively.  This is particularly important, given the current economic climate.  The JLC and REA systems have been the subject of a number of legal challenges recently, which have gone to the High Court.  The Bill will strengthen them and make them more effective.  It will provide for a number of amendments to the existing legislative framework surrounding the JLC and REA systems, including improved procedures and clear principles and policies to be taken into account by JLCs when formulating proposals for the EROs.  It also provides that EROs and REAs in future will be given legal effect by ministerial order and that the perceived gap in the scope for parliamentary supervision will be filled by providing for Oireachtas scrutiny of these instruments.</P>
        <P>I welcome the recent co-operation within JLCs which has facilitated reform, for example, the agreement reached on the adjustment of the Sunday premium rate, from double time to time and a third, that has already taken effect in hotels and catering establishments in recent times.  This is a very positive and realistic approach.  The Bill changes the definition of a worker to allow the offices of the VECs to access the dispute settling agencies &mdash; other than teachers.  It provides for improved procedures to be followed when formulating proposals for EROs.</P>
        <P>Unlike my rural colleague, Deputy White, I admire the work of NERA and I welcome its decentralisation to the south-east.  However, I have many issues with its behaviour in the current economic climate.  All workers must be protected, whether they are vulnerable or otherwise, but we cannot crucify employers, and that is happening in certain cases.  I have had a meeting with Mr. Ger Deering and his senior officials and none of them was ever self-employed.  I would suggest that all such officials, especially those engaged in visiting businesses and companies, should have some understanding of the other side of the story.  It is not all one way traffic.  They come with their high-powered cars and they are intimidating to businesses, small enterprises especially, arriving in the dead of night in some cases, to restaurants looking for the books when people are busy.  These officials will have to be reined in and I believe NERA&rsquo;s entire <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> must be questioned and changed.</P>
        <P>I would seek to make it relevant to today&rsquo;s economic realities.  While we must protect workers&rsquo; rights we must also try to protect the rights of the self-employed, the business people who are the shapers and movers trying to stimulate the economy.  If anything is to lead us out of the present morass, they will, but not while they have all these shackles on their backs. <Col N="65"/> NERA is one shackle too much.  I have spoken to the Minister of State about this on numerous occasions.  I am not criticising any individuals in NERA but rather its whole policy in the present economic climate.  I should prefer to see it as an employment-support agency, helping business, and showing better balance.  Its officials come in, literally touting for business.  I asked Mr. Deering whether they give their business cards to every employee and he said they did, where possible.  I believe that is touting for business and asking for trouble.  It is tantamount to politicians going around interfering in different businesses, offering their cards and inviting employees to give them a call if the boss is not treating them right.</P>
        <P>The fundamental structure of NERA has to change.  I have been a small business employer since 1982 and I understand the situation from that perspective.  There has to be balance and I honestly believe we are going to have to examine that whole set-up and the costs associated with it.  I believe there are four or five regional offices, and that is something the economy cannot afford.  It is flamboyant, with the headquarters in Carlow.  This is a relatively new institution.  I do not believe it is even underpinned statutorily, since legislation is still going through the Oireachtas in this regard.  It has to be reined in.  We cannot afford it, there are too many staff and they have too little to do because the businesses they are visiting are disappearing just like the snow in recent weeks.  I have mentioned many of the reasons, but basically the costs of doing business are too high.</P>
        <P>If we do not take action, the NERA will not have a role to play because there will be very few, if any, businesses to call to, especially small to medium-sized enterprises.  We know the footfall has diminished in terms of the purchasing power of ordinary consumers.  We accept that and we are trying to drive down costs, while NERA and other bodies such as those responsible for health and safety legislation are driving them upwards.  The situation is totally over the top and I make no apologies for saying this.  The approach is not measured and the people charged with administering those issues on behalf of NERA should have an understanding of how difficult it is to create even one job, and to grow that into ten or 50, especially in the present economic downturn.  Even before the recession it was difficult to maintain profitability.  Ultimately, there must be profits if businesses are to survive and reinvest in further and continued employment. They must have some understanding of what it is like to have sleepless nights about paying wages, rates, ESB bills, the Revenue and water charges.  We have lost the run of ourselves and people cannot afford such costs.  In addition, the banks are treating many of their customers outrageously over charges.  Meanwhile, the Revenue Commissioners go to court as fast as lightning and pass the matter on to sheriffs.  I have likened the behaviour of these people to the activities of the Black and Tans in the past.  A recent television programme exposed the carefree and flamboyant attitude of a sheriff, asking whether there was anything worth taking in a house.  It is outrageous.  We are giving these powers too easily and there is too much money, commission and perks involved for these people.  The legislation is outdated and must be changed.  We must examine the matter holistically and treat our workers properly if we are to get back to a viable position of economic growth.  I accept that we have come a long way in that respect, but there will always be cases of abuse concerning workers, which is unacceptable.  We must also have balance, however, in supporting employers and other business drivers.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the chance to say a few words on this Bill.  Although time is limited, I wish to deal with a couple of aspects that should be discussed as part of employment legislation.  I accept that the inability to pay element is being introduced as an amendment, but it is a pity that the Minister is not here to discuss the matter.  I understand the Minister is under pressure to increase the minimum wage, but it is a dodgy road to go down <Col N="66"/>and will lead to a clamour of businesses arriving at the Labour Court with their accounts.  They are under immense pressure and in certain sectors businesses will be competing with each other in the same town.  How will they win their inability to pay cases at the Labour Court?  Why will one case succeed, while another will not?  The situation will be murky and while I am sure it is all above board, it is a complicated area due to the nature of the businesses involved.  I hope it does not come down purely to profit.  Many businesses can survive but they will need some help.  There are many other costs that we can reduce for them, apart from an inability to pay the minimum wage or some agreements which are not much more than the minimum wage.</P>
        <P>The Department should also consider the inability of certain businesses to pay rents.  The law needs to be changed in that respect to allow for inability to pay rental agreements that have already been signed.  It is crazy for landlords to demand rents from people who cannot pay them.  A 10% or 20% reduction will not be enough.  They will need 50% reductions because rent levels are mad in places.</P>
        <P>In certain situations we will have landlords who have some of their businesses in NAMA, while on the other hand they are forcing their tenants to pay exorbitant rents.  Four or five businesses in my own town have been threatened that they will be pursued for their homes if they do not honour rental agreements.  The landlords in question are delighted to jump into NAMA, but they are not showing any leniency to their commercial tenants.  The Minister should examine the question of tenants&rsquo; inability to pay.  It is an important issue, but it is relative.  If we can drive down the cost of doing business in other sectors, we will not have to touch the minimum wage.  If businesses can survive due to a reduction in rent and rates, they will not have to plead inability to pay the minimum wage.  Many of the high costs of doing business are Government-regulated, including water charges, council rates, insurance and energy.  I accept that energy costs have come down a bit, but we are still above the European average so they are too high.  Irish banking charges are among the highest in Europe.  The Minister of State sat at the committee meeting where we heard about this.  Now that the Government owns a fair stake of the banks, maybe something can be done in that regard.  However, the Government probably has an incentive to raise banking charges because it can make a profit from them.  Nonetheless, we should examine the matter.</P>
        <P>It is a shame that the whole debate on the survival of businesses is coming down to the minimum wage.  That is wrong.  The Minister of State should not say that anybody on the minimum wage is being paid too much.  On 40 hours a week, one would be lucky to bring home &euro;330, or &euro;300 for a 35-hour week.  Many workers have to pay for a car, clothes and other costs associated with having a job.  Some people would be better off on social welfare.  On its discussions with businesses, the Government should avoid being drawn into a debate on the minimum wage.  It should clarify the situation soon because that is not where the problem lies.  I am pro-business.  Some business groups are not afraid of the minimum wage but of the argument that the next pay level must be the minimum wage plus.  Therefore, the minimum would be the bottom line and everyone else is demanding more than that.  That is probably why some people want the minimum wage reduced &mdash; so that they can bring other wages down, but that is unfair to people on the minimum wage who work in industries covered by such agreements.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is right to say that in some sectors those earning the minimum wage may not have a strong voice or a good educational background and are not unionised.  They do need extra help and protection, and not just in respect of pay.  We always discuss the pay element, but many such people are not always treated that well.  The legislation looks good on paper, but there can be abuse in rosters and shift systems.  Such workers can be abused in other ways, too, because people think they can take advantage of them, which is unfair.  We have a duty to watch that, not just to the letter of the law but by applying some common sense.  The <Col N="67"/>previous speaker referred to representatives of various agencies, of which there are many, popping into such places to ask simple questions.  It is not about reading up on legal books, but just about watching what is going on because we are all aware that some people are not treated well at work.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Various agreements cause difficulties and some stupid cases have arisen whereby geography or a particular type of business can dictate an agreement.  New legislation is required to make all the necessary changes.  That would be a chance to have a good debate on employment legislation.  Businesses need such legislation because they are swamped with red tape and it can be a major hassle to understand regulations.  Some businesses make mistakes and end up being punished badly.  Proper legislation would help to clarify their rights as well as changing stupid legislative provisions.  As a country that no longer has full employment, we should re-examine maternity and parental leave arrangements.  I raised this matter a few years ago with the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, but he was not prepared to change things outside pay agreements, which are now in question.  It is time that Ministers started making decisions.  Now is the time to do something for children by examining what is done in other countries, such as France and Sweden, where families have better entitlements.  It could be time to reverse some of Charlie McCreevy&rsquo;s stunts on tax, which do not help families.  There is a chance to have more job sharing, both in the public and private sectors, for the benefit of children who missed out in the Celtic tiger era when everyone was rushing around.  We will see the consequences of that in years to come.  Now is the time to re-examine the matter through a proper discussion on employment laws, the minimum wage and wages generally.  The piecemeal Bill before us deals only with a small sector, so it is time for an all-encompassing Bill to deal with employment legislation generally.  A solid debate is required to ascertain where we are going over the next five or six years.  The employment market has changed utterly in the past two years, so we need to take a good look at all the relevant agreements.  We need to tackle wage agreements, but not the minimum wage.  There is plenty of work to do and the Minister of State is willing to engage in such matters by making the right decisions.  I note that the Bill restores some powers to the Minister in order to take action in this regard.  I welcome that because we are meant to have a say and take decisions here.  We should not leave everything to bodies outside this House because people are fed up with that.  They want more decisions to be made here.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have this opportunity on behalf of Fine Gael to move this motion which provides that we will carry out certain actions that will ensure we have a better response in future to crises, such as the recent flooding, frost and snow crises, than we have seen in recent weeks from the Government.  We should learn from the experience of the past few months and put in place the necessary measures to ensure we are better prepared to respond on behalf of our people.  Politics is about people.  In recent months people suffered tremendous hardship as a result of the severe weather; houses had to be vacated and stock and property were badly damaged during the recent flooding.  People suffered great inconvenience and the response was haphazard throughout the country, despite the best efforts of the front line services.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment to this motion is a reiteration of what the Minister cynically announced yesterday on account of the Fine Gael motion.  He said he would reallocate some moneys for the purpose of water conservation.  He had no answer last week, but over the weekend an answer developed.  In my view it was a cynical exercise to make that announcement rather than address the issue of what he intended to do in the House tonight.  The Minister and <Col N="69"/>the Government continue to operate on the basis that in the short term they cannot provide additional funds for local authorities and front line services to deal effectively with the crisis.  Nor are they planning for the future to ensure that in the years ahead we will be better able to cope with the problems, particularly those relating to water.  The Government cannot continue to bail out financial institutions but have no money for anything else.  Last November, for example, when we discussed the flooding crisis, an indication was given that we would have an early warning system in various places similar to what is in place in the United Kingdom.  We were to have a better website and better information with regard to flood warnings.  I have seen no developments or initiatives taken since that indicate any urgency about these matters.</P>
        <P>The difficulties experienced by the country following the floods last November, the severe weather in December and January and the water shortage crisis ongoing today have been compounded by a Government that has lost all capacity to plan and act quickly in an emergency.  The ministerial decisions of this Government have been reduced to a bookkeeping exercise, as Ministers have been reduced to just signing off on funding or cuts in expenditure.  The Government has lost the ability to see a problem with its own structures, let alone identify a solution.  This is a symptom of a Government that has become tired and lazy in its term of office and it is unlikely to solve the problem in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The Government never prepared a national plan to deal with severe weather.  This is why its initial response to the severe weather took so long to organise.  Despite numerous attempts by Fine Gael to obtain a copy of the national plan to deal specifically with severe weather, which was committed to by the Office of Emergency Planning several years ago, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government confirmed that the Government did not have such a plan.  This explains the Government&rsquo;s initial slow response to the weather crisis and its initial confusion when it finally met.  The Office of Emergency Planning&rsquo;s website clearly states, &ldquo;A national framework for response to severe weather emergencies is being developed to ensure that all existing local severe weather plans are appropriately coordinated and linked.&rdquo;  A national crisis requires a national response.  It is now evident that no severe weather crisis plan was drafted and that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government attempted to cobble together a response three weeks into the freeze when people were already suffering.</P>
        <P>The three lead agencies, the Garda, the HSE and local authorities operate within an inherently flawed system.  There is a framework which provides guidance to local authorities, the HSE and the Garda on responding to major emergencies.  However, that in no way constitutes a national plan.  There are not 34 micro climates across Ireland.  The same problems were experienced widely across the country during the flooding and big freeze.  Logically, this requires a national response and national co-ordination.  It is wrong to suggest there are just three lead agencies.  If the local authorities are the lead authorities, then there is a total of 36 lead agencies, including the HSE and the Garda.  That is a recipe for disaster.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must be always the lead agency into which the local authorities can feed information.  Allowing local authorities call a national emergency means the reaction around the country to a crisis will be always fragmented.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael wishes to express its admiration for the valiant efforts of local authorities and their staff who, despite cutbacks of 12% in their budgets last year and the termination of the contracts and employment of many people, dealt with the weather crisis during the holiday period despite the lack of leadership at national level.  What should be in place is a plan that specifically outlines how the Government co-ordinates a national response.   A national plan should clearly identify the following: specific named routes to be cleared and gritted as a first priority; access to airports to be cleared; ports to be kept accessible in their order of priority; major hospitals to remain accessible; ambulance and medical evacuation contingencies; identify specific public <Col N="70"/>transport routes to be serviced as a priority if bus and rail services fail; the use of military transport to move people if public transport fails;  and identify regions where the population is isolated and vulnerable and assign military helicopters and trucks accordingly.  This is a real plan, but none of these measures was instigated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government during the recent crisis because it did not realise there was a national crisis.  The Minister for Transport abandoned ship when the country needed action and leadership over the Christmas period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the time remaining to me I would like to deal with the issue of water problems.  My colleagues, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, Fine Gael spokesman on transport, and Deputy McEntee will deal in their contributions with the problems concerning roads and other problems.  It is appropriate to examine why, in 2010, Ireland can suffer from such massive systems failures that have resulted in prolonged water shortages when the country is still recovering from record levels of flooding.  The answer is simple, a lack of  reform.  The policy of Fianna F&aacute;il led Governments of simply throwing money at a problem, instead of analysing what has gone wrong with a system and how it can be fixed, can be blamed for our inefficient, outdated and fragmented water supply system.  Fianna F&aacute;il has stood over a system that saw 43% of all drinking water lost through leakage, before the recent cold weather caused the problems affecting supplies today.  What Fine Gael proposes is to radically shake up the entire system to ensure a dependable, clean and cost effective water supply for everyone.</P>
        <P>Radical change on how we provide water is urgently needed.  There is a way to do this.  Currently, Ireland&rsquo;s 29 county councils and five city councils are responsible for the management of water infrastructure in their areas.  They all apply for funding to Government for a slice of the &euro;4.75 billion for capital works promised under the latest national development plan.  These 34 water authorities then all work away on their own projects within their localities, with very little interaction or co-ordination between authorities.  The recent flooding crisis in Cork, which caused severe damage to Cork City Council&rsquo;s main pumping station, demonstrated why better integration with neighbouring water infrastructure is necessary.  Fine Gael proposes, in its document NewERA which was compiled by my colleague Deputy Coveney, a new State utility company called Irish Water.  The Minister stated recently that the Fine Gael proposals were not costed, but they are costed.  We can get further enlightenment on how to draw greater resources to resolving our water problem by taking the opportunity to examine that document.  Many of the problems associated with the current system, which is fragmented on a county by county basis, would be overcome by having a central utility company responsible for water provision.  The Fine Gael plan is progressive and seeks to fix the current system and to provide a better quality of service to homeowners and businesses alike.  In addition, a single company could achieve significant economies of scale by planning for water investments across the country.  Water quality is a separate issue, but I will not go into that now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current national development plan commits &euro;4.75 billion to water infrastructural investment over the period 2007-13.  However, the current financial crisis is having an impact on water investment.  Last year the capital provision for water services infrastructure was cut by &euro;60 million to &euro;500 million from what was envisaged in the 2009 Estimates.  New investment in water infrastructure in the future is unlikely to come from Government sources.  Therefore a new way must be found to attract additional resources for the resolution of this matter.  The &euro;300 million the Minister announced yesterday to be provided over three years to deal with water conservation will mean the work on all the pipe networks the Minister wishes to replace to eliminate the leaks will be slow, cumbersome and will not happen for years.</P>
        <P>Additional resources are required to fix the pipes and ensure there is good-quality water in the taps and that people have a good standard of living.  That people cannot depend on their <Col N="71"/>supply of water in the post-Celtic tiger era is an indictment of the economic policies that have been pursued in the past ten or 12 years.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s water policy, if implemented, would decrease the national debt by between &euro;3 billion and &euro;5 billion depending on the valuation of the existing network.  If it were taken on board, it would free up resources in the local authority system.  Financing would be achieved through State equity and commercial debt.  The policy would provide an essential water system of good quality to those who need it.</P>
        <P>It is not acceptable that there was a cut of &euro;173 million in the allocation for the road network in 2009.  This was done without a whimper by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  Investment in the road network must be considered urgently in 2010.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s Department and the Department of Transport receiving submissions from the local authorities.  I ask the Minister to take an interest in these matters bearing in mind the funding required by local authorities to carry out the necessary works.  He should ensure the submissions from the local authorities on road reconstruction and rehabilitation will be considered such that we will accept there is a problem with some local and regional roads.  Access is critical to people.  It is a prerequisite that people be put first, and we should be able to reallocate resources to ensure this is ultimately the case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague for the opportunity to talk about what we want and do not want in the future.  I did not get a chance to talk to the Minister last week.  I was very proud at the opening of the waste management company Panda and I am sure the Minister was also.  The man behind the company told me what was in his head four years ago.  It was great to be at the opening and to see how waste should be handled.</P>
        <P>The road on which the Minister travelled to Meath is famous because it was built so the Queen of England could visit Slane Castle.  It was built in a straight line.  Any time I come to Dublin I come by that road because I encounter very few difficulties thereon.  It is when one moves off the road that one encounters problems.</P>
        <P>Opposite the Panda site there is a landfill and near Duleek there is an incinerator.  I am glad the landfill may be closed and that the Minister will not allow any more incinerators in Meath.  Planning permission is due for an incinerator in my village, Nobber, which has no adequate road into it.  I hope An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be consistent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am giving the Deputy some latitude.  He might address the motion during his contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to make another comment on this matter and will come to the subject of the roads.  The homestead of the Minister&rsquo;s father is in the Laytown-Bettystown area.  Having read this motion, I believe it is time we in the D&aacute;il had a reality check.  We read in the newspapers before our resumption after the recess that, according to some top economists, there is to be an economic upturn.  We are supposed to believe this; yet, when one goes home at the weekends and talks to businesspeople, one realises the economists are not telling the people the truth.  The same applies to roads and water, the two most vital resources required in terms of making progress.</P>
        <P>I did enough shouting at Christmas over what did and did not happen but would like to believe that what will happen will be the total opposite of what the Government is doing.  There are 400,000 people unemployed.  The road network to the left and right of the road on which the Minister travelled is such that one cannot pass when going to Duleek or Kentstown.  The same applies in other counties.  I noted this last week when I was in eight different counties throughout the four provinces.  We cannot continue to allow roads to deteriorate.</P><Col N="72"/>
        <P>The Minister is not in office for a long time but it is time he and other Ministers were taken out of their ministerial cars and brought for a proper spin.  Instead of going to the Cheltenham races, they should be brought in an ordinary car&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>He could cycle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might not be going himself.  The Ministers should be brought along the ordinary roads.  They are complete deathtraps.</P>
        <P>Last weekend, my phone was hopping.  My house is full of bills left with me by constituents in the hope that the county councils will repair their cars.  It is a complete nightmare.  I refer not only to the roads for which the local authorities are responsible but also to the roads for which the NRA is responsible.  The N52 from Dundalk to Tipperary is a complete disaster.  I went to a funeral in Kells on Saturday and noted three roads out of the town were closed due to accidents.  One was the main road from Kells to Navan, another was the N52 and the other was into Moynalty, yet the plan is not to allocate funding.</P>
        <P>The same applies in respect of water, a basic need.  Housing estate after housing estate is without water.  Ballivor in County Meath is still without water.  The houses to the left and right of the road on which the Minister travelled have no water.  It was only four years ago that I realised 50% of our water is lost.  What better way is there for the Government to create employment than to invest in the two phenomena that will ultimately ensure the country gets back on its feet, roads and water?  Water is life.</P>
        <P>Hauliers will not travel on the roads or go to the garages anymore because they cannot afford to do so.  Garages are at a standstill because people cannot afford to fix their cars.  Our engineers, plumbers and carpenters are all in Australia.  Every last person from my village had to leave this country.</P>
        <P>The Ministers should start taking control of their Departments and get rid of their advisers, who are covering up for them.  They covered up for the Ministers at Christmas.  I learned that although I am a slow learner.  The advisers did not go to the Ministers&rsquo; Departments and tell them the truth.  We were told the problem that arose was Fine Gael&rsquo;s problem.  This was stated in an e-mail to journalists.  It was actually the problem of the Government that the people were experiencing hardship.</P>
        <P>At Christmas people were spending a little, as one will learn if one talks to the traders on Grafton Street.  However, it all stopped during the first week in January.  The head adviser to the Minister for Finance, about whom one reads in the newspaper today, is away with the fairies.  The VAT returns for January and February will prove to be the worst in the history of the State.  I predict this because I talked to people on the ground.  Shop after shop has closed.  There has not been a load of concrete delivered and there is no plan to build anything.  There are 400,000 unemployed.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should stop making cuts repeatedly and engaging in chequebook government.  That is not the way to run a business.  While one must tighten one&rsquo;s belt, one should not stop investing.  Some 400,000 are unemployed and we expect another 75,000 to join them.</P>
        <P>I was ashamed of my life to learn on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; last night that our plan is to start leasing houses and covering up.  If this country is to make progress, the Ministers must acknowledge what real life entails.  People are in desperation and houses will be repossessed one by one because we have looked after a group of people who have conned the Minister for Finance. <Col N="73"/> They will not tell him the truth and, at this stage, he does not want to know the truth.  If one wants to run a country, one must invest in its basic infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Last week, the Minister for Transport delivered an eight-page speech complimenting people on all the work they did.  Those people are paid to do the work.  Nobody compliments me on the work I do; I am paid to do it and do not care what people say.  One does not have to write eight pages complimenting people on the work they are doing when they are paid to do it.  In spite of staff leaving the councils, the Government will not hire engineers and front-line staff. We are going nowhere until someone on the Government Front Bench takes responsibility and realises what is happening in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister will inform me he has no responsibility in dealing with the recent flooding.  The tragedy is the other 14 Ministers also say the same.  I commend this motion because I have never seen such flooding as that which occurred recently.  I accept there will always be cases of unprecedented heavy rainfall and flood flashpoints but do people have to suffer as much as they did recently?  I do not believe so.</P>
        <P>The sooner a single authority to manage the Shannon river is introduced, the better for all concerned.  I attended the IFA meeting on the recent flooding, a meeting I have attended 20 times over the years.  Each of the participants &mdash; the OPW, Waterways Ireland, the ESB, the fisheries boards &mdash; gave a mission statement of their importance and what they do.  That is not good enough.  There must be an integrated single authority to manage the Shannon.</P>
        <P>I am not silly enough to believe there will never be flooding.  However, the Shannon must be managed in such a way that at the height of the flooding season it would be 1 ft. lower than it is now.  Engineers inform me this is entirely possible and practical.  Ships can easily navigate the river and fisheries will not be affected.  Lowering the river level by 1 ft. would make a great difference to the tens of thousands of families living on the banks of the Shannon and its tributaries.  Now that the recent flooding affected inland towns such as Ballinasloe, there will be a mood among the public for an amazing change in this regard.  I cannot see how the Government will do this, given its track record.  However, even at this late stage it must tackle the issue.</P>
        <P>I believe the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government thought up his recent announcement on water conservation overnight.  I know of a large water group scheme that lobbied the Department for an extra &euro;1 million for nothing more than to ensure meters were installed.  It had to sign a particular contract recently that would mean that two thirds of 580 houses in the scheme would be metered and the remaining third would not.  The scheme was told there would be no funds available for it to install the extra meters.  On the same day, the Minister announced &euro;300 million was being made available for water conservation.  Why was this not communicated to the scheme?  Where was the forward planning?  I will test the Government&rsquo;s and the Minister&rsquo;s sincerity on this and we will soon find out what conservation means to them.  Will the &euro;1 million now be made available to the Caltra-Castleblakeney-Ballymacward water scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Hogan for tabling this motion.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Government and the local authorities failed the people in the recent cold snap.  We were the laughing stock of the world.  We got a small bit of snow and the whole country and capital city came to a halt.  I had a visitor from Chicago at the time and he started laughing at our response.  He informed me when it snows in Chicago, the ploughs are dispensed first to push the snow to one side and then the gritters salt the roads.  In Ireland, we let the snow be frozen over and then we had problems for a month.</P><Col N="74"/>
        <P>The people of rural Ireland suffered with floods in November and December and then snow in the new year.  There was not a word about the snow until Dublin got five snowflakes.  The minute they got five flakes in Dublin, the whole world knew there was a problem.  Everyone was then looking for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, but neither of them could be found.</P>
        <P>The local authorities did not do too bad a job in clearing the national primary roads.  They were a disgrace, however, when it came to the national secondary roads and footpaths.  From St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day to when the cold snap finished, hundreds of people had to attend hospital with fractures due to falls on footpaths all because the local authorities did not do their job.</P>
        <P>When I put down a question to the Minister on local authorities, I am informed by him he has no responsibility in the matter.  That is carried through to the local authorities which also claim they have no responsibility for anything.  When we did not have enough salt to grit a few roads, sand was not allowed to be taken from beaches because we were afraid it might damage the environment.  The people were outraged by this.</P>
        <P>Car owners have NCT tests and must pay road tax and car insurance.  They must pay large Government levies when buying a car when one could buy one cheaper elsewhere in Europe.  They expect the local authorities and the Minister to maintain roads in a fit state.  Last week no Third World country had as bad a road as the Bellacorick to Belmullet road.  It was inspected last week by the National Roads Authority.  Under the old system, the Department and the authority would tell the local authority to start the work on it and the funding would be sorted later.  Now, the authority tells the local authorities not to start the work until it gives them the funding and go-ahead.</P>
        <P>Why was there no national plan in place for the recent cold snap?  Why was the Army not called out sooner?  Why were people who offered assistance in their communities ignored?  They did not even get a bit of grit to spread because the local authority did not believe they were fit to do the job.  The Government, the local authorities and the other agencies involved have all failed and let the people down.  We were the laughing stock of the world because when we got a small bit of snow our whole economy collapsed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The motion calls on the Government to focus its attention on the dismal state of our national water services and the disastrous state of our county roads.  The Government must take urgent and decisive action to address these problems.  This is a time of national crisis and we must ensure all necessary action is taken to avoid the same widespread damage being inflicted again on people.  I acknowledge the great work done by county council staff in Sligo and Leitrim in trying to keep roads open and water services in operation in spite of weather and resource difficulties this month.  However, the great practical work done by the staff does not diminish the inaction and indifference of this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government to the state of our water services and roads.</P>
        <P>The motion lists the large problems in water services and roads.  I was without water supply for a week during the recent frost and snow and understand the difficulties faced by thousands of people who were also without water supply.  In many counties the potholes are back with a bang.  In Sligo and Leitrim, some local roads are so badly broken up that they are virtually impassable.</P>
        <P>These problems follow on from the flooding before Christmas.  During that crisis, water treatment plants were out of action while drinking water supplies were contaminated by human and animal waste.  Families and businesses were forced to leave their property.  Many local roads were blocked while towns and villages were isolated.  Rail and bus services were cut off. <Col N="75"/> All these events show the consequences of the Government&rsquo;s indifference to the real problems being faced in rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>The widespread devastation caused by the flooding before Christmas and then the present failure of water supply services across the country demonstrates clearly the urgent need for a strategic and integrated plan for our national water resources.  These resources are an important natural asset to Ireland.  In the past, the priority for our major freshwater resources was electricity generation.  For the future, the new national priority must be the freshwater systems as a national resource for drinking water.  It must be managed from this perspective.  The fundamental requirement is an integrated approach through which energy generation, amenity, fishing, boating, water sports, recreational tourism, drinking water resource, pollution control, flood management and protection are considered in a strategic and balanced way.  In the recently introduced Inland Fisheries Bill 2009 the Government introduced the concept of eight river basin districts as the fundamental model for a comprehensive new approach to the management of water resources.</P>

	<P>The Deputy has one minute remaining.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Having made this major strategic decision, the Government&rsquo;s focus dropped to a low level institution role and relationship problems.  I urge the Government to withdraw that Bill.  What is urgently needed is a single semi-State water utility tasked with the comprehensive management of all aspects of our rivers and lakes.  It is only in this way we will get the best strategic direction and management of one of our most valuable natural resources.  </P>
        <P>On severely damaged local and regional roads, I urge the Minister for Transport to reconsider his priorities and to reallocate funds within his departmental budget so that we can invest heavily in the urgent repair of county roads.  The Minister has funds that can be reallocated.  For example, he is funding many suburban road improvement projects in the major cities, including a proposal from Fingal County Council for an additional bus lane in a Castleknock housing estate which will cost millions of euro.  This new bus lane will serve approximately four morning bus runs and 100 passengers and might result in a five minute time saving.  I believe this money should be reallocated.  We must get our priorities right.  The Government&rsquo;s appalling mismanagement during the past six weeks illustrates its regard for and how out of touch it is with the needs of rural Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Hogan for introducing this motion.  It is timely given our recent experience in terms of rainfall, frost and snow.  It is clear the Government had no plan in place to deal with the weather crisis.  It is not funny that, Ministers abroad aside, Dublin city came to a standstill as a result of the snow.  A friend of mine from Prince Edward Island asked me how the Government would deal with four or six feet of snow if it cannot deal with two inches of it.  The Government must re-examine its plan.  We cannot afford to allow the country to come to a standstill again.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, instructed all schools to remain closed without any regard to the needs of parents, both of whom may have been working, in terms child care. </P>
        <P>I suggest that the Minister examine how Monaghan County Council works.  It has been planning for such a storm for years and immediately gritted not alone national primary but national secondary and main regional roads.  It ensured lorries were able to access farms to assist with poultry, pigs and so on and that commerce continued.  There is no reason, except for a lack of ability on the part of Government, this cannot be done at national level.  Monaghan County Council had to have in place a plan.  The Government closed Monaghan hospital and had it not had a plan in place the roads required to bring sick people by ambulance to the nearest hospital would have been closed.</P><Col N="76"/>
        <P>As a result of the weather crisis roads will need to be repaired.  I represent Cavan-Monaghan which, as the Minister may recall, were recognised in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the pothole counties.  I beg the Minister to ensure money is made available to ensure this does not happen again.  The surface of our roads are damaged, some more seriously than others.  However, if they are tarred again and sealed enormous damage will be avoided in the future.</P>

	<P>Conservation of water is important.  Monaghan County Council reduced water loss from 40% to 30%.  I accept this figure has increased a little recently owing to burst water pipes.  Group water schemes were mentioned earlier by my colleague.  There is a group water scheme in Monaghan and it is providing a good service to farmers and households, which is approximately 1,600 people.  It is doing so without one penny of grant aid from Government although the Minister promised me that when he was elected he would look into the matter.  My letters have never been answered.  That is not the way to run a country.  One needs to have in place a plan.  I urge the Minister to ensure proper plans are in place and that funds are made available to ensure roads and water pipes are repaired.  There is no point providing water and then allowing some 43% of it to be wasted at enormous cost.  The Minister is in Government and we will give him all the support he wants if he does the job right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Hogan, for bringing forward this motion.  This is essentially a debate around learning lessons from the big floods and big freeze, which sums up our weather pattern for the past three months.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I am short on time and will for this reason concentrate on two specific issues, the first of which is water management.  I am aware that the Minister has in recent days proposed a change in the funding model for water provision in Ireland, namely, the introduction of water charges.  The Minister needs to also examine the manner in which water services and treatment is delivered.  We must never again allow a situation whereby half the population of a city the size of Cork is left without water for ten days.  Between 16,000 and 20,000 households had no water for ten days because there was no back-up supply or no way of connecting to Cork County Council&rsquo;s water supply network.  We must now consider the establishment of a single water authority or, Fine Gael&rsquo;s preference, a single water company to manage and deliver the infrastructure that is necessary to provide clean drinking water as cost effectively as possible.  We spend &euro;1.2 billion per annum on the provision of water to our population, some 50% of which is wasted by way of leakage through pipes before it reaches its destination.  To quantify it in monetary terms, we are wasting hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money that could better be spent elsewhere because we have not put in place the type of infrastructure necessary to deliver water efficiently.</P>
        <P>It is not good enough to simply change the manner in which we fund an inefficient way of delivering water.  We must also change the structure and use local authorities as agents for delivery.  We must give one authority or company the responsibility of delivering a comprehensive system for the entire country rather than have 34 local authorities doing their own thing in their own regions while dependant on the budget available to them in any particular year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Second, I want to ensure that never again will we have elderly people in Cork city waking up to find flood waters lapping against the bottom of their mattresses.  We have the technology and telecommunications infrastructure necessary to allow Government, throughout whatever emergency response unit it chooses, to warn people through <Col N="77"/>mobile phones that flood waters are on their way.   The Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, is currently considering proposals from Fine Gael in this regard.   I hope he will take them on board.  </P>
        <P>The Government in a short space of time could require mobile phone companies to make available their mobile phone mast infrastructure to ensure it can make direct contact with people through their mobile phones.  Every household in the country has a mobile phone and virtually every person has one. There is no excuse for not providing direct communications to warn people when emergencies or floods are on the way.  I would ask the Minister to act on that without further delay.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am pleased to contribute to today&rsquo;s debate on this Private Members&rsquo; motion and set the record straight regarding the response to the recent severe weather.  The Government appreciates all the personnel of the various agencies, both public and voluntary, individuals and communities for their the useful work in assisting their fellow citizens during the recent severe weather event.</P>
        <P>The severe weather brought out the best in community spirit.  Individuals and community and voluntary organisations played an invaluable role.  This includes those who cleared snow and ice from outside their homes and business premises, people who visited their neighbours to ensure that they had food and heat and those who manned telephone help lines.</P>
        <P>The cold weather started on 17 and 18 December and lasted through to the middle of this month.  It was characterised by extremely low temperatures over a prolonged period, with a widespread incidence of snow and ice.  The last such occurrences in Ireland were the winters of 1963 and 1978-79.  We had a blizzard and lower temperatures in January 1982 which caused widespread disruption, but the thaw set in within a week.  It is clear, therefore, that such prolonged severely cold weather is extremely rare and our response must take this into account.</P>
        <P>At this point I clarify my Department&rsquo;s role during the difficult weather period, particularly from the beginning of the year.  Its primary role is to ensure that the local authorities are prepared to respond promptly to deal with issues directly under their remit.  The Department also has a role to ensure that councils act in co-operation with the other principal response agencies &mdash; the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive &mdash; the voluntary agencies and the Defence Forces to limit the effects on individuals whose lives may be put at risk or who may be exposed to serious hardship.  The main concern, therefore, is that effective emergency plans are in place.  The management of the emergency response on the ground then falls to the local authorities and the other response agencies.  It is a principle of emergency management internationally that the response to emergencies builds from the basic organisational units with a capability to respond.  In Ireland, the principal response agencies are based locally and, where necessary, regionally.</P>
        <P>As was experienced during the flooding event in November last, the local authorities are prepared to respond promptly and effectively.  Part of the local authorities&rsquo; preparation includes ensuring that arrangements are in place to receive early warnings from Met &Eacute;ireann and where necessary to be proactive in public relations and public information.  The Met &Eacute;ireann forecasting arrangements entail a single system known as public service severe weather warning and cover meteorological conditions and elements such as wind, rain, thunderstorm and coastal storm surge.  The emphasis is on warning of weather events that will cause significant disruption or constitute a significant risk for people.  Met &Eacute;ireann issues a severe weather warning to local authorities where conditions are forecast in accordance with criteria set down by the authority.</P>
        <P>The Framework for Major Emergency Management put in place in recent years enables the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health Service Executive and local authorities to prepare for and make co-ordinated responses to a variety of major emergencies whenever a major emergency occurs. <Col N="79"/> All principal response agencies have major emergency plans based on this framework since September 2008, and the various State and voluntary bodies used the procedures and training they received in responding to the difficulties encountered in their areas.  The framework also includes a sub-plan for responding to severe weather events.</P>
        <P>There are two levels of public response which require consideration &mdash; the local response and the national response.  On local response, the co-ordination and inter-agency arrangements worked well in so far as was reasonably feasible.  We must recognise that local authorities cannot salt all of the 96,000 km of roads in the country, which is extensive by European standards, or the footpaths of which in Dublin city area amount to 2,500 km.  The local authorities kept the national roads, other key strategic roads and public transport routes, together totalling some 14,000 km, open for traffic over the 24 days that the severe weather lasted, which is an important point to keep in mind at all times.  These roads carry an estimated 60% of total traffic and 80% of commercial traffic.  While driving conditions were sometimes difficult, which can be expected in such weather, it was possible for the public and private sectors to maintain their delivery and receipt of goods and services.  In response to Deputy Ring, the economy did not come to a halt.  The economy continued because of the work done by the local authorities.</P>
        <P>One could debate the response to the recent weather event at length comparing it to previous severe weather periods.  What is important is the response to the prolonged period.  Accessibility was maintained on the national road network and measures were in place to assist those in need by the statutory agencies and voluntary bodies.  Like the flooding event, it was good to see the extent of co-operation and assistance from all organisations and individuals.</P>
        <P>I note that the Fine Gael motion commends the local authorities and their staff for their response, which is a considerable change from what the party was saying during the cold weather when TDs accused local authorities of not doing their jobs.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which I find regrettable.  I would have expected more support and encouragement of our local councils and responsibility from the party that takes pride in describing itself as the largest party in local government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gormley has nobody in local government.  I am surprised to hear that from someone who has no one in local government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>At central level there was no unnecessary delay in responding to the emerging situation.  From the second half of December, staff from the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Transport were liasing with local authorities and the NRA and monitoring the ongoing situation.</P>
        <P>Local authorities successfully responded to the severe weather demands up to the end of the year.  They had staff out working throughout the Christmas period, unselfishly, including on Christmas day, to ensure main roads were kept open.</P>
        <P>It was when the period of severe weather was prolonged, when business and schools were about to resume after the Christmas period and the possibility of a shortage of salt for the roads emerged, that the need for the National Emergency Response Co-ordination Committee <Col N="80"/>arose.  I convened the committee at the request of the Taoiseach in the first week of this month, before the position became acute and the need for convening the committee arose.</P>
        <P>The committee oversaw the co-ordinated response at national and local levels and ensured that all statutory agencies co-operated efficiently and effectively and that any decisions required at national level were dealt with promptly.  It is not a function of the committee to take responsibility from the Departments and agencies.  It provided a forum for the exchange of information between the Departments and agencies concerned, oversaw the local level response, provided a forum for early decisions when a central government direction or decision was required and acted as a central briefing medium for the Government and the national media.</P>
        <P>Having attended the National Emergency Response Co-ordination Committee, and in light of the interaction of the various Departments and statutory agencies, I am satisfied that there was an active and sustained response to the recent severe weather conditions by the local authorities and the other principal response agencies, with the support of the Defence Forces and co-operation of other statutory and voluntary bodies.  It will be important to learn from the recent experience and, accordingly, a review of the emergency response co-ordination and inter-agency arrangements will be undertaken.  This will assist in determining what further improvements can be achieved and identifying any relevant lessons that can be learnt from the experience here and in other European countries over recent weeks.</P>
        <P>Several important issues arose including public transport, supplies of rock salt stocks, clearing compacted ice off footpaths, access to emergency services, water supply, electricity supply, school closures, and so on, but the main priority for local authorities was accessibility of the major road network.</P>
        <P>To respond to some of the points made by Deputy Ring, the fact is that when it came to the flooding we were in a position to go down the country almost immediately, and I visited those areas worst affected such as Ballinasloe, Ennis &mdash; I visited there promptly, in fact, the very next day &mdash; and, indeed, Cork.</P>
        <P>The point Deputy Ring made about sand is simply not valid.  The emergency co-ordination committee looked at the prospect of using sand.  In fact, we looked at every possibility.  This was explained to the media at the time.  The sand on beaches did not have sufficient salinity, and it would have had no effect.  That was just not usable at the time and, therefore, we did not pursue that issue.  All of that was looked at in detail.  I, again, commend the work of everybody who sat on that committee.</P>
        <P>There is one point to note. Perhaps I will make a comparison later, but let us compare our response to that of the United Kingdom.  We had ten days&rsquo; supply of rock salt whereas the UK had a mere six days&rsquo; supply.  Anyone on the Opposition side of the House may make these comparisons and I believe we would emerge from such comparisons very favourably.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair play to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Since mid-December all local authorities were engaged in an extensive campaign of road gritting, using a combination of sand and salt to melt the ice and snow in response to severe weather warnings issued by Met &Eacute;ireann.  One of the criticisms heard during the period related to the extent of the road gritting exercise.  One could find fault with the extent of gritting but the ongoing availability of rock salt dictated that treatment was restricted to national roads.  The extent of the extremely low temperature resulted in rapid depletion of supplies of rock salt maintained by local authorities.  Coupled with the widespread extent of the severe weather throughout much of Europe, local authorities and the National Roads Authority experienced difficulties in sourcing sufficient new supplies to keep adequate <Col N="81"/>salt for spreading on roads.  The position regarding salt was much more severe in other European countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>There was grit available all over Europe selling at &euro;47 per tonne.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the two major areas referred to in the Opposition motion, namely, roads and water supplies.  By and large our national roads, other key strategic roads and public transport routes were kept open for traffic during the 24 days that the severe weather lasted.  These are the facts.  With careful driving, most of our secondary road network remained passable throughout the period, with limited exceptions especially in upland areas.  It is certainly true that road and footpath conditions were difficult and dangerous where iced over but most roads were open and people were able to get about as they needed to, albeit perhaps more slowly.</P>
        <P>The majority of bus services continued to operate in Dublin and nationwide, albeit with some cancellation or curtailments during the worst of the snow.  The websites of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann provided regularly updated information on the impact on services.  Irish Rail and Luas services were largely unaffected and some extra capacity was provided where possible.  While there were delays and diversions at airports, the bulk of air services continued to operate.  Where airports closed for short periods, it was for safety reasons to allow runways to be cleared of snow.</P>
        <P>As part of the overall review of this recent experience, the Department of Transport will re-examine the priorities for gritting of roads.  At present, the priorities are national roads and other roads that carry significant traffic volumes, including heavy goods vehicles and public transport services.  More than 261 gritting trucks and 180 snow ploughs were deployed during the severe weather, often late at night and early morning.  Approximately 60,000 tonnes of salt was spread over the period, more than the total annual average use in recent years.  It will never be practical to grit all 96,000 kilometres of our public road network.  At the moment we grit in excess of 14% of the network and it is unlikely to be justifiable to increase this substantially.  What can be considered is whether there are ways of harnessing community effort, for example, by local authorities supplying salt to local communities and business districts.  This would involve extra cost for the taxpayer at a time of severe constraints on public finances and may not be justified given the infrequent incidence of prolonged severe weather.</P>
        <P>Local authorities typically maintain ten days&rsquo; supply of salt compared to a supply of six days in the UK.  This is for gritting the prioritised roads and it is more than adequate for most years.  Cold spells of such a long duration are rare.  Nevertheless, the costs and benefits of maintaining a supply to cover a longer period will be considered.  This could involve more expenditure on salt supplies and salt barns to protect these supplies.</P>
        <P>The possibility of introducing a statutory obligation on householders and businesses in urban areas to clear snow and ice from footpaths outside their premises without incurring any liability for negligence will be considered by the Department of Transport.  While local authority staff were deployed to clear the busiest footpaths in urban areas, similar to the case of the national primary roads, it was not practical for them to clear all the footpaths in urban areas.  As I stated at the time, I took advice from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and I was informed that the idea that people could be held liable was not the case.  If people made a reasonable effort to clear the footpath that was deemed to be fine.  However, I understand people may need such a reassurance and for this reason it is something we could consider putting into legislation, which is the case in other jurisdictions whereby there is an obligation on the individual to clear in front of the house or business premises concerned.  In other jurisdictions there is a series of <Col N="82"/>rules that goes with severe weather, related to winter tyres and the wearing of chains.  We are not used to it in this country and we do not have the legislative framework at this stage.</P>
        <P>Another area for review is how public information was handled and what could be improved.  Local authorities made very effective use of local and community radio.  The public transport websites were regularly up to date.  Some local authority websites provided detailed road gritting maps and the Road Safety Authority was very helpful in sending out targeted road safety messages.  Best practice examples will be built upon and any information gaps or failures will be identified.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport is conscious that both the National Roads Authority and local authorities have, and will continue to incur, significant additional expenditure as a direct result of the prolonged severe weather.  I understand the Department of Transport does not have an emergency financial reserve.  It will allocate all the road grants from the Exchequer for the coming year, more than &euro;1.1 billion for national roads and approximately &euro;411 million for local and regional roads.  This is a significant investment in our transport infrastructure on behalf of the Government despite the difficult position of the Exchequer finances.  Since 1997, more than &euro;15 billion has been invested on national roads while some &euro;5.7 billion has been contributed from the Exchequer for local and regional roads.  Local authorities have been advised to set aside contingency sums within their overall roads funding for weather related works.  In addition, local authorities and the National Roads Authority are calculating the additional costs involved over and above the normal provision.  The Minister for Transport will assess this when finalising the allocation of regional and local road grants, as will the National Roads Authority in respect of national roads.  It may be necessary to change priorities in the 2010 allocations, taking account of the available financial resources.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the Minister for Transport has issued a circular to local authorities requesting them to give priority to the repair of damage to regional and local roads caused by recent weather and authorising them to incur expenditure under certain grant categories of up to 25% of the amount allocated for these categories in April 2009, pending the allocation of the 2010 grants.  He has also allowed the local authorities flexibility to revise to their 2010 restoration improvement programmes.  The role of the Department of Transport in respect of local and regional roads is to provide grants to supplement road expenditure by local authorities.  Some local authorities contribute as little as 5% to their total road expenditure from their own resources.  Local authorities must prioritise increased expenditure from their own resources on their own roads this year in view of the current difficult situation.</P>
        <P>In assessing the Irish response during the severe weather, it would be valuable to compare ourselves with other European countries.  When one does so, the clear fact emerges that the disruption here was no worse, and in many cases much less severe, than in most other European countries, including those with regular experience of severe cold weather.</P>
        <P>Significant traffic delays during snowfalls were a common experience throughout Europe, but unlike many other countries Ireland was able to keep the main arteries open.  Airports were forced to close for periods during snowfall in every northern European country.  While train services suffered limited delays in Ireland, they ground to a halt in many other European countries.  Finally, the national co-ordinated response in January ensured that salt supplies were managed to keep main roads open, unlike other European countries.  I can confirm this is the case following a meeting with ministerial colleagues recently.  Given my interest in this issue, I asked my colleagues how they coped in such countries as the Netherlands, Germany and throughout Europe and we fared better.  That is the fact of it and I would be pleased to subject the response to any objective review to establish how we managed our resources.  Comparisons <Col N="83"/>with what took place in 1982 are completely misplaced because we are in a far better position now to deal with these issues than we were at that time.</P>
        <P>The severe weather episodes this winter have identified a number of weaknesses in our water services infrastructure.  It has also shown that although we are fortunate to have an abundance of raw water in Ireland there is a lack of recognition of the real costs of treating this water and distributing this water to our homes and businesses.  Some 1.6 billion litres of water are treated daily by local authorities.  The low density and spatial distribution of the population means an extensive water network is required to distribute this water compared to many other countries.  The public water services network amounts to more than 20,000 km of pipes, 8,000 km of which are in the greater Dublin area.  This fact alone poses challenges for ongoing maintenance and management.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The recent prolonged period of particularly low temperatures caused difficulties for most local authorities in maintaining normal water supplies.  The initial difficulties arose mainly from frozen supplies, but as the thaw set in further damage was caused by the moving ground.  Typically, over a fortnight period, demand was up to 25% greater than maximum water treatment capacity in most authorities.  This was as a result of both leakage and some consumer usage to avoid frozen domestic pipes.  Excess demand resulted in the depletion of treated water at the reservoirs, which would normally provide two day storage which is the international norm.  Demand has been progressively reducing through local authority efforts to find and fix leaks and manage supplies, and conservation by consumers.  However, it could be a number of weeks or months, depending on local circumstances, before reservoirs are restored to pre-Christmas levels.  It is a huge inconvenience to people and continues to be an inconvenience.  I am well aware of this from my constituency, which has suffered from this problem.  For that reason, we must act.  I agree with all Deputies that it must be addressed and that is the reason we are reprioritising the funding.  I will discuss that later in my contribution.</P>
        <P>Some of the incidents of burst water pipes in housing estates across the country, which have caused significant hardship for householders, could have been avoided by proper workmanship and by developers ensuring that construction standards for new housing fully met basic requirements, such as those set down in my Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;Recommendations for Site Development Works for Housing Areas&rdquo;, which include standards for the amount of cover to be laid over water pipes.  Within the home, the building regulations provide that in bathrooms and kitchens, the cisterns, service pipe and fittings and any associated cold water pipes should be adequately protected against damage by frost.</P>
        <P>When considering planning applications, local authorities generally attach conditions to ensure that these standards are properly adhered to by developers.  Where it is found as part of the formal taking-in-charge of an estate or through assessments of compliance with a permission, that sub-standard piping or inadequate systems have been installed, the local authority should take enforcement action against the developer to bring the development up to the standard required by the planning permission and the building regulations.  My Department will be writing to local authorities to remind them of the development management requirements under the building regulations and the site development guidelines and to impress on them the need for regular monitoring and enforcement to ensure a consistent application of these standards across residential developments.</P>
        <P>These recent events arose from exceptional weather conditions.  I commend the many local authority workers who responded to these events, working much longer hours, often in difficult conditions, to restore supplies and to find and fix leaks.  While we rightly expect to turn on our taps to see good quality water flowing out, we often fail to appreciate the costs and complexity <Col N="84"/>of providing this basic service, or that prolonged periods without water such as were experienced by some consumers this winter are indeed very rare.  The difficulties do, however, point to the fine balance in water treatment capacity in some of our larger urban areas, and the extent and age of networks which already have an unacceptably high level of leakage in normal circumstances.  This means that the infrastructure can be particularly vulnerable to disruption by severe weather events.  Consequently, it is appropriate to consider the wider policy issues facing the Irish water sector, in tandem with efforts in the short term to return service to normal.</P>
        <P>While &euro;4.6 billion has been provided by the Exchequer to local authorities for investment in this sector over the past nine years, this was against the background of historical under-investment.  In addition to catching up with these deficits, the sector has had to respond to the increased demand arising during a time of economic and population growth.  This investment has led to significant progress.  Substantial improvements have been made in the quality of water in the group water sector and some 480 major public water and waste water schemes have been completed since 2000.  These schemes have delivered an increase in drinking water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 855,000, and led to improvements in compliance with the requirements of the EU urban waste water treatment directive on secondary waste water treatment facilities, which now stands at 92% compared to 25% at the start of 2000.</P>
        <P>With the adoption of the water framework directive, which emphasises a holistic approach to water resources management considering all aspects of the water cycle, the water services sector is entering into a new phase.  The river basin management plans, required under this directive, are the key tool for the strategic planning of the range of actions required by the different actors to meet the objectives of the directive.  These objectives are to prevent deterioration in the status of existing waters and, where feasible, to achieve at least &ldquo;good status&rdquo; for our waters by 2015.  The evolving river basin management plans will be a critical underpinning of investment in the sector over the coming years.  The renewed programme for Government has committed to maintaining record levels of investment in water, and this year some &euro;508 million has been allocated, one of the few areas of capital provision which saw an increase over the 2009 provision.  This is evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to this important area in these difficult economic times.</P>
        <P>We will ensure that these resources are targeted at priority areas from an economic and environmental standpoint.  Last summer, as part of the development of the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, local authorities were asked to critically review their water services needs to ensure that contracts advanced and schemes in planning over this period meet the programme priorities, are affordable, offer value for money and are the most cost effective solutions for addressing problems.  The programme priorities for the coming period include the need to mainstream and enhance water conservation activity, to address environmental and public health compliance issues, to support the overall strategic and sustainable development of gateways and hubs, and to support employment creation.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy document &ldquo;Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy &mdash; A Framework for Sustainable Economic Revival&rdquo; and specific work by Forf&aacute;s in 2008 in assessing the water and waste water needs of enterprise, provide the framework for prioritisation of the infrastructure required to support economic recovery.  The work associated with the first cycle of river basin management plans and the priorities identified by the Environmental Protection Agency, which is responsible for monitoring and reporting on performance on both drinking water and waste water services, provide important inputs on the priorities for investment on environmental and public health grounds.</P><Col N="85"/>
        <P>An important aspect of the new Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, which will be launched towards the end of February, will be the targeting of investment on water conservation.  It does not make economic sense to provide for further water supply capacity in areas with unacceptability high levels of unaccounted-for water; the leakage levels in some areas are stark and must be tackled.  The &euro;130 million we spent on various water conservation measures over the past seven years has made a considerable difference.  This investment has mainly been focused on establishing water management systems and active leak detection and repair programmes.  Local authorities have identified some &euro;300 million in contracts to commence over the period 2010-2012.  This investment is only part of the overall action on water conservation.  I am grateful for the public response.</P>
        <P>As I have only two minutes left, I will focus on water conservation.  Water metering is a necessary component of ensuring that our valuable water resource is managed and used efficiently.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Hogan voice Fine Gael support for this on national radio yesterday, albeit that it has taken Fine Gael 12 years to see the error of the decision it took in 1997 to scrap domestic water charges.</P>

	<P>This Government&rsquo;s intention, which we announced in December, is to introduce charges for water in a way that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied.  I will shortly bring detailed proposals to Government on a programme of metering of households on public supplies.  It is envisaged that the installation of water meters will commence during 2011.  International experience shows that once water meters are installed people are more careful in how they use this resource.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fine Gael has proposed that a new semi-State water utility company should be established to assume responsibility for water investment and management nationally.  I am bemused by Fine Gael&rsquo;s ability to criticize the Government for the number of State agencies currently in place, while at the same time proposing the establishment of a new one.</P>

	<P>I will outline why I see no reason for the introduction of such a quango.  Indeed, I can only conclude that Fine Gael wants to establish such an agency because the party wants to privatize our water services.  </P>

	<P>I am generally satisfied with the current arrangements which I believe will improve considerably with the implementation of a river basin approach to water management.

The arrangements put in place did work, but there is some room for reflection and review of lessons learned which can be built upon.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three parts to the Fine Gael motion.  The first is the approach to the recent severe weather we experienced around the country.  The second is the aftermath of the recent weather and flooding in November and the costs which will have to be borne by local authorities in clearing up the damage to our roads which resulted.  The third issue is water disruption and what needs to be done in response to that issue, which was also caused by the recent weather.</P>
        <P>I read an article by Tom Clonan in <i>The Irish Times</i> on how the Government responded, what the framework was for its response and if its response fitted into that framework.  One point he made, which is the correct description of our recent weather, was that it was a slow-moving and entirely predictable emergency.  We all knew before the Christmas holidays there was bad weather and we would have a white Christmas.  The bad weather was predicted for at least a couple of weeks before it happened.  The snow started in earnest on 1 January.  I was travelling from Cork on that Friday.  It started to snow and the traffic started to slow down on the N7.</P>
        <P>By Monday it was clear there were problems arising.  People were having difficulty getting out of their housing estates and getting into work and there were many slips and falls.  The Government&rsquo;s emergency co-ordination committee did not meet until the following Thursday.  We know that because it was confirmed by Sean Hogan at the recent meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  There was a Cabinet meeting around that time.  The emergency co-ordination committee meeting took place very late in the day.  After Sean Hogan made his presentation to the committee I am still not clear who was in charge of co-ordinating the responses to the bad weather.  I am not clear who the lead agency was.</P>
        <P>My reading of the framework document for major emergencies is that the lead agency for the situation we had regarding the recent snow, ice and flooding should have been a Government Department.  In regard to the snow, it should have been the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, but Sean Hogan argued that was not the case and that it should have been the local authorities.  That is my understanding of the debate.  He had a document which said the lead agencies for responding to the flooding in November were local authorities.  I do not accept that was the Government&rsquo;s correct response.  It has misinterpreted its own document because when I read it, it said local authorities should only be the lead agency by default and that ideally the lead agency should be a Government Department.</P><Col N="87"/>
        <P Just="Left">I read Tom Clonan&rsquo;s analysis and he has the same interpretation.  He refers to the lead agency and the severe weather, and says the document identifies the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as the Department with responsibility for co-ordinating a national response in emergency situations.  There was a major problem, namely, that the Government was not willing to take on board the responsibility to give leadership regarding how to respond and co-ordinate the response to the recent weather and the flooding.  There was an idea that local authorities should be left to fend for themselves.  To be fair, their response was not perfect but local authority workers were out in many areas on New Year&rsquo;s Day and Christmas Day and were very much left to their own devices until the emergency co-ordination committee met on Thursday, 7 January, when the crisis was well under way and all of the problems had arisen.  There had been many small accidents and many people had slipped and fallen.  Schools were also in a problematic position, nobody knew what would happen regarding the opening of primary and second level schools.</P>
        <P>For future reference, the Government has to take responsibility.  The weather and flooding do not fit within local authority boundaries.  The idea that local authorities should be the lead agency is not the correct response.  In future the Government must take responsibility from the outset as soon as it becomes apparent that there is a crisis.  It needs to meet and co-ordinate activity much earlier.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the aftermath of the severe weather, local authorities have had severe cuts in funding to their roads budgets and have had to cut a large number of staff.  For example, Cork county, which was very badly impacted by the flooding and bad weather, has lost some 500 staff over the past year.  I note the Cork county manager said it would need substantial funding to repair the roads in the aftermath of the flooding, snow and ice, that the roads had been damaged by gritting and that substantial road repairs would need to be carried out.  Cork County Council applied to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, for &euro;16 million to carry out the necessary repairs after the flooding and it was granted just under &euro;6 million, which falls well short of what it needs.  The county manager also complained that its overtime budget has been cut substantially so it cannot have people working overtime to carry out the necessary repairs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Cork County Council is just one example and is probably one of the worst hit  local authorities, but local authorities will be struggling in the year to come unless special provision is made for them to carry out proper road repairs.  If these road repairs are not done, they will get worse.  We will have accidents and lives may be lost because of the condition of the roads.  I urge the Government to make sure that when the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, announces the road budget in February he makes extra provision for local authorities which need to carry out road repairs because of the recent flooding and bad weather.</P>
        <P>On the issue of water, over the past few years the focus on investment in water infrastructure seems to have been on meeting the need for increased capacity in the water supply because of all the extra housing we built, the need to improve the quality of our drinking water because of requirements under European Union law and the need to comply with the water framework directive by 2015.  That investment has been made.  As a result of the recent problems with the existing creaking water infrastructure, the Minister has now decided to divert moneys which were to go new capacity and projects to deal with existing infrastructure.  That appears to be a knee-jerk and crisis driven response by the Minister.  He is also being opportunist because he is using the issues that have arisen as an excuse to say he will introduce water metering and water charges.</P>
        <P>Whatever about the merits of those proposals, they are a red herring in terms of what needs to be done about our water infrastructure.  A national strategy is required to deal with the need to increase capacity, the need to improve water quality and the need to repair the creaking <Col N="88"/>water infrastructure that is in place for many years.  We do not have enough information about what needs to be done.  Instead of responding in a knee-jerk and headless chicken way, the Minister should present a national strategy on what he will do to improve the water infrastructure.  He must provide information on what needs to be done, where the problems arise and where the infrastructure is in need of repair.  That information must be made available to public representatives and to the wider public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to indicate my support for the general thrust of this motion, both in its references to the impact of the recent weather crisis and the inadequate response of the Government, as well as the proposals regarding measures to ensure an improved response in the event of any future recurrence.  I would also like to refer to some of my party&rsquo;s views and policies on these issues.</P>
        <P>I note and welcome Fine Gael&rsquo;s commitment to public control of the water supply.  We will all watch closely to see what measures the Minister will introduce, as he has promised, to address the current situation.  Clearly privatisation is not the way forward.  That has been proven in other countries.  Public utilities have been one of the targets for venture capital unwilling to invest in the real economy, mainly in less developed countries but also in some developed states where companies seek to profit from pre-existing public facilities.  Britain is an example of this where the consensus appears to be that despite increased investment, this has been offset by a huge increase in the cost to the public in charges, as well as resulting in a decline in both the quantity and the quality of the water supplied to households.  I trust this is not a route that the Minister will ever contemplate going down.  I certainly hope not.</P>
        <P>Some of the problems associated with the absence of a single State body in charge of water supply were illustrated by the recent crisis and the manner in which supply was cut off in some local authority areas.  Most local authority areas have experienced that in the recent past.  A national body would be in a position to ensure not only a constancy of supply but also that this operates evenly across the State.  It would also, of course, have the responsibility to ensure the proper upkeep of treatment facilities and the supply network.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Both the motion and the Minister in a recent interview have referred to the dangerously high level of treated water that is lost, which has been estimated to have been 43% prior to the cold spell.  That is an indictment on the State and local authorities that so much water is lost.  There is also the scandalous waste which the Minister is correct in stating must be addressed.  However, linking that to the proposal to meter and charge for water to households is not the solution if the wastage is due to leaks within the system rather than people being careless or abusing the water supply, which is a problem as was again witnessed recently and needs to be tackled.</P>
        <P>There is a need for proper conservation and people need to be educated in regard to the importance of preserving the water supply and the damage done by wasteful household practices.  Some people are not aware of how much wastage is actually involved.  For example, during the cold weather some people were leaving water taps running to cut down on the risk of frozen and burst pipes.  Some of my neighbours did this.  I can understand why.  Primarily, the water was getting frozen coming from the supply to their houses rather than inside the house.  In order to prevent damage to boilers, back boilers and so on they allowed the water to trickle overnight and there was wastage as a result but that was not their fault.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to the introduction of water charges as a solution as, in effect, it only acts as an extra tax with no guarantee that the revenue gathered will be directed towards the water supply.  As with waste charges the suspicion is that they amount to no more than a double taxation, which gets away from the issue, particularly in the case of water where the State has <Col N="89"/>been negligent in investing in this area.  The question that also needs to be answered is why the infrastructure was allowed to fall into such a bad state during the years when the State did have the revenue to undertake the necessary capital works to modernise it and to ensure that this most vital of public utilities was not threatened, as it patently is now, by facilities that are not capable of guaranteeing security of supply, even at times when there has been no shortage of the raw material to be treated and supplied to the public.</P>
        <P>In regard to the flooding in the west and the midlands, the division of responsibility for the River Shannon caused serious problems, especially when none of the ten existing agencies involved were in a position of ultimate control.  The ESB controls its weirs along the River Shannon, with the main weirs located at Athlone, Meelick and Parteen.  The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, or Inland Fisheries Ireland after the amalgamation from April 2010, has responsibility for conservation, but has no statutory obligation in respect of flooding.  Waterways Ireland has an interest in water levels but only so that cruisers have enough water for navigation and on occasion it removes small pockets of silt so that cruisers do not run aground.  The Office of Public Works has an annual maintenance programme of dredging in tributaries of the  River Shannon each year and was a key player in the meetings called by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, in response to the crisis.</P>
        <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service, like the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, has to be consulted before any dredging and has an obligation under EU legislation regarding the protection of certain species.  Local authorities, Bord na M&oacute;na, the Shannon River Basin District Authority and the Environmental Protection Agency also have responsibilities regarding various aspects of the health of the river and its basin.  There is clearly a need to co-ordinate the overall responsibility for the River Shannon under one authority.</P>
        <P>The exceptional rain experienced in November raised the water on the River Shannon to record levels and caused severe flooding to nearly 100 houses with a further 70 families affected by access in the Athlone area.  The impact of the flooding exceeded all past experiences and left homes flooded, contents damaged and destroyed, road impassable, land and businesses flooded and individuals and families having to abandon their homes and relocate elsewhere.  Some people are still in temporary accommodation around the town.</P>
        <P>The flood co-ordination group, involving Athlone Town Council, Westmeath County Council, the HSE, the Defence Forces, Civil Defence, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Athlone flood relief centre distributed 30,000 sandbags, provided evacuation assistance, emergency accommodation, transport and humanitarian and financial support.  Waste disposal facilities, skips, cleaning materials, disinfectant, gloves, brushes and protective clothing were distributed.  The cleaning of all public roads and sewers was also undertaken by the local authorities.  This voluntary effort was immense and should be commended.</P>
        <P>Other parts of the country were also affected and I witnessed some of the damage caused in Carlow and Sallins.  The main complaint that I have heard was as referred to in the motion, the slowness of response on the part of the State.  There are also serious issues, as I have referred to elsewhere, in regard to planning permission being granted for housing developments in places where location and history would have indicated a serious risk of flooding in some areas.</P>
        <P>The motion also refers to roads, and again serious problems were encountered during the cold weather with many roads closed.  Every county has been affected.  I have never seen roads in such a dilapidated state as in recent weeks.  We have been told that given the cuts in local authority funding this will have huge repercussions for the repair and restoration of most of those roads.  There is an urgent need for funding to be made available to local authorities so that they can deal with this issue.  I support the motion and call for the establishment of a plan <Col N="90"/>for a severe weather agency in the event there being a repeat of such poor weather conditions, whether prolonged rain, ice or snow.</P>
        <P>I have one question for the Minister of State.  Has the Government applied for EU emergency funding?  I understand the deadline is tomorrow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>In the five minutes at my disposal I shall condense a subject that one might spend two hours discussing.  I raised the matter many times in this House but never in the teeth of the situation that pertains today.  As I understand it, under an EU Habitats Directive, on 1 January 2010 the derogation ran out for turf cutters on 32 designated bogs.  This means that thousands of Irish turf cutters  &mdash; I count myself as one &mdash; will be shunted off our bogs this coming summer.  We find it extremely difficult to understand how any Government or European Union bureaucrat would organise a scheme whereby ordinary turf cutters are not allowed to cut their own domestic supply on their bogs at a time when the price of a barrel of crude oil is rising by the day and we are in the middle of the worst recession since the 1930s.  It is unbelievable that a Government would stand for this carry on.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, is present but am equally sorry the Minister concerned, Deputy Gormley, to whom we spoke during a previous debate, is not in the House.  This is his watch.</P>
        <P>Only a fraction of these bogs are cut.  I can only speak for the bog I know best, Carnogopple in my parish.  It measures 1,200 acres, of which the State owns almost 1,000.  The turf cutters control only 120 acres and cut perhaps only an acre or and an acre and a half between them every year.  It is against that background that we cannot understand why we cannot be allowed to continue to cut our 10% of the bog as we have been doing for generations while the other 90% is subject to conservation.  The same situation applies to most of the other 31 bogs over the country but primarily those in the west of Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the 1930s my grandfather got a small holding of land from the Land Commission, as did thousands of other Irish farmers.  That body was so far seeing at the time it ensured that every man around the country like my grandfather got an acre of bog.  It was sustainability, that big word of the Green Party nowadays.  It ensured they could have their cooking and heating as part of the overall package of their everyday life.  They had no need of imported fuels.  In the fullness of time my grandfather transferred the right to my father who, in turn, transferred it to me.  I am in a lucky position.  I have a son to whom I will transfer my right and am equally delighted to say I have a grandson to whom I hope it will go in the fullness of time.  I will not be the weak link in that generation chain and allow the bureaucrats of Brussels or the Government stop us from doing something that is so very traditional and so very Irish.  It has almost no effects on climate change or on anything of that kind.</P>
        <P>Because of who he is and where he comes from, I know the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, will understand fully what I am talking about.  If he got half a chance he would echo my exact words.  I genuinely believe that the thousands of people who will be discommoded will not allow this to happen, on model grounds.  They will cut their turf this year in the ordinary way and will believe themselves within the law, as I believe they &mdash; and I &mdash; will be.  The <Col N="91"/>Minister set up an interdepartmental committee last September.  We have heard nothing from him and I want to know where we stand because there are only six weeks to go before the start of the turf cutting campaign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s desire to raise this matter which is obviously of concern to turf cutters affected by the cessation of cutting. </P>
        <P>In 1999, 32 raised bog special areas of conservation, SACs, were designated.  At that stage the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands ended commercial turf cutting on these sites but allowed turf cutting for domestic purposes to continue for up to ten years from the date of designation.  This was intended to allow turf cutters to find an alternative source of fuel.  This period has now expired and a complete cessation of turf cutting on these sites is now required.  Further cessation will become necessary in 2012 and 2014 as the ten-year derogation expires on other designated sites.  However, ending this derogation will still leave by far the major proportion of all bogs &mdash; some 96% &mdash; available for turf cutting.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s raised bogs are important and unique habitats hosting ecosystems that are extremely rare.  Because we have a large proportion of the little that remains of this habitat in western Europe, we have a particular responsibility to preserve it.  Ireland is required to prevent the loss of habitats of European importance under the Habitats Directive of 1992.  Active raised bog is a priority habitat under the directive and Ireland has designated a representative sample of raised bogs for preservation.</P>
        <P>A review of the state of our designated raised bogs in the form of examination on the ground has revealed severe and continuing damage caused by domestic turf cutting.  This is the result, not only of the physical removal of peat, but of the drainage that is caused in the process.  This drainage effectively bleeds the bogs.  The result is that the active area, where peat is formed, contracts, and the typical flora disappear.  There is, therefore, a very obvious physical loss at the face bank and a less visible, but more extensive, loss of priority habitat across the entire bog.</P>
        <P>In the 10 years since commercial cutting was ended in designated areas, some 35% of the remaining area of active raised bog has been lost through domestic cutting and its associated drainage.  We are losing a further 2% to 4% of our remaining active raised bog in these sites per annum.  It is vital that we halt and reverse this damage, if we are not permanently to lose this irreplaceable ecological resource.</P>
        <P>Outside the 32 bogs mentioned, cutting may continue as normal.  In particular, blanket bogs, which comprise most of the areas of peatland, are not affected by the arrangements.  Of the 1500 -1600 raised bogs in the State, only 130 bog complexes are designated and turf cutting is to cease now on only 32 of these.</P>
        <P>Since 1999, the Government has actively encouraged the cessation of domestic cutting by buying the traditional turf-cutting rights through a voluntary scheme of compensation.  This covers both SACs and NHAs.</P>

	<P>Last year, The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government established an interdepartmental working group on cessation of turf cutting in designated areas.  This is examining all the implications of cessation, including the question of replacement fuel sources.  The working group invited and received submissions from interested groups and individuals.  It also met representative groups concerned with turf cutting and with groups concerned with protection of the bogs.</P><Col N="92"/>
        <P>The working group is currently finalising its report, including recommendations for managing the cessation.  The Minister expects to receive the report shortly and having considered the recommendations, will make an early decision on necessary measures.  He will be in touch with representative groups and individuals as soon as possible thereafter, to advise them of any arrangements that are to be put in place.</P>
        <P>The Minister appreciates that this is an issue of concern to several Deputies, particularly in regard to the effects any cessation might have on those who rely on their bog plots on designated sites as a source of fuel.  This is a central consideration of the interdepartmental group and will be fully considered in its advice to the Minister.</P>

      <sTitle>Radon Gas Levels.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Radon gas levels were the subject of a &ldquo;Primetime&rdquo; programme on Thursday evening last.  I raised this matter in the House in February 2005 and numerous questions relating to it have been raised here in the interim.  New research published yesterday by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, shows extremely worrying levels of radon gas in households throughout the country.  According to the new data, every county in Ireland has at least some homes that exceed the safe limit of 200 Bq/m3 of air.  Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas which is colourless, odourless, and tasteless and that is what makes it so dangerous.  It is cited as the leading cause of between 150 to 200 deaths from lung cancer each year.  Up to 90% of these cases occur in smokers or ex-smokers.  These individuals have a much higher chance of developing lung cancer following exposure to radon than do non-smokers.</P>
        <P>Results from counties in the west, south east and south show particularly high levels of radon.  However, no part of Ireland is immune.  County Sligo has the highest percentage of homes with levels of radon that are above the national reference level in respect of the gas.  Some 24% of the homes tested in Sligo are above the safe level.  More than 15% of the homes tested in Waterford, Galway, Carlow, Wicklow, Mayo and Wexford are also above the safe level.  To date, almost 38,000 homes have been tested since the introduction of such testing in the early 1990s.  The RPII believes that only 5% of the estimated homes with unsafe radon levels have been identified.  It is believed that 91,000 homes are above the national reference level.  This is a matter of grave concern because thousands of people are being exposed, unknown to them, to radon gas in their homes.</P>
        <P>Some 40% of the 50 highest measurements of radon levels in homes throughout the country were recorded in Kerry.  These include the highest ever recorded level of radon in a home.  The house in question is in Castelisland and the level recorded there was 245 times higher than the safe limit.  In the past 12 years, three of the people who occupied the house have died.  The RPII announced on the 13 October last that two homes in Tralee were identified as having levels of radon that were among the highest found in Europe.  These new reported levels were the third and fourth highest measurements found in the country to date.  The homes involved had concentrations of radon of 13,797 Bq/m3  and 8,490 Bq/m3, respectively.  The data to which I refer indicates that the Tralee-Castleisland area is a major radon hot spot.  It also indicates that many more houses in area have high, unsafe levels of radon but have not been identified because they have not been tested.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appeal for the introduction of a national strategy in respect of radon.  The RPII cannot deal with all aspects of the radon issue.  Although there has been good co-operation between the RPII and other State agencies, including local authorities, the Health Service Executive and the Health and Safety Authority on reducing the risk posed by radon, it is important that this <Col N="93"/>co-operation be developed into a cohesive national strategy aimed at addressing the radon problem.  The strategy should be spearheaded by a Minister.  This approach was advocated at the radon forum which took place last November.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the World Health Organisation published a radon handbook containing models for radon programmes.  One of the recommendations contained in the handbook is to link radon to the conveyancing of homes.  Certificates confirming that radon levels are below the reference level are already required to be produced in England, Wales, Sweden and some parts of the United States when houses are being sold.  Ireland should follow that example.  In 1999 the Swedish Government decided that radon levels in all homes should be below the reference level by 2020.  It should be our objective to ensure that all homes in this country are below this level by 2030.</P>
        <P>Since the introduction of the building regulations in 1997, there has been a requirement to the effect that radon barriers should be put in place in new buildings in high radon areas and that stand-by sumps should be installed in all areas.  I strongly recommend that the regulation should be changed to provide radon barriers in all new houses in every part of the country.</P>
        <P>Another recommendation that could be considered for inclusion in a national strategy is the provision of free testing and remediation grants in designated hot spots.  At present, Sustainable Energy Ireland provides grants in respect of house insulation.  This scheme could be extended to include a grant for radon remediation, where required.</P>
        <P>This is an issue of national importance.  The introduction of a strategy such as that to which I refer could mean life or death for many people.  It is time the Government showed leadership.  It should not leave it to the RPII, other agencies or individuals to resolve the difficulties relating to this matter.  I hope the Government will put in place a national strategy because that is the only way in which we can tackle this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this important matter and I welcome the opportunity to inform the House of the current position in respect of radon.</P>
        <P>In July 2008 the RPII published the results of a landmark study, Radiation Doses Received by the Irish Population.  The report indicates that natural radiation sources account for almost 86% of all radiation exposure received by the Irish population.  Radon alone accounts for 56% of total exposure.  By comparison, artificial radiation sources, such as those emanating from overseas nuclear energy facilities, account for a mere 0.4% of the total radiation dosage we receive.  The report concludes that in terms of reducing our exposure to radiation, radon is the area where the greatest impact is possible.</P>
        <P>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas which is found in variable amounts in rocks and soil.  Ireland&rsquo;s unique geology gives rise to radon levels that are above the international average and are the sixth highest in the world.  Radon is a known carcinogen.  Long-term exposure to high radon levels presents a direct risk to human health.  This makes radon a public health issue.  The RPII estimates that 150 to 200 annual lung cancer deaths in Ireland are linked to radon.  These figures represent approximately 10% to 15% of all such deaths.</P>
        <P>The national survey of radon in Irish dwellings was conducted by the RPII between 1992 and 1999.  Approximately 28% of the country is designated as a high radon area, where more than 10% of households are predicted to have radon concentrations above the national reference level of 200 Bq/m3.  This is the threshold, defined by the RPII, above which it is recommended that remediation works be carried out.  High radon areas found in almost every county but are mainly concentrated in the south east and the west.</P>
        <P>From the results of the national radon survey, it was estimated that approximately 7% of our total housing stock has radon levels above the national reference level.  The RPII recom<Col N="94"/>mends that every householder have his or her home tested for radon.  The RPII and a number of private companies offer a radon measurement service to householders.  The cost of this service varies from &euro;40 to &euro;80.  Radon measurement is non-intrusive, involving the placing of two small, palm-sized radon detectors in the home.  It takes three months to complete.</P>
        <P>Since 1998 the building regulations require all new buildings to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction.  With regard to houses built before 1998, the Government&rsquo;s approach, which is similar to that of the majority of EU member states, is to concentrate on awareness-raising.  The RPII, in partnership with local authorities and the HSE, has carried out targeted information campaigns in high radon areas.  In some areas where particularly high radon levels have been found, householders have been contacted directly.  This encourages householders to address monitoring and remedial requirements effectively and economically.</P>
        <P>There are proven and effective remediation techniques to reduce indoor radon concentrations at a reasonable cost.  Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the RPII.  In addition, the website of the RPII provides a list of companies which can provide radon remediation services and which can offer specific advice and recommendations.  There is nothing complex about these techniques and the majority involve relatively simple building work.</P>
        <P>The Department has given approval to a number of local authorities to undertake, on a sample basis, radon surveys of their housing stock in high incidence areas.  In addition, the RPII has directly contacted local authorities with known areas of high radon concentration in order to encourage them to test their housing stock for radon and, where necessary, take remedial action.  A number of local authorities are already taking action in this regard and it is intended to build on their and the RPII&rsquo;s experience in this area.</P>
        <P>The Department will continue to work closely with the RPII, the HSE, local authorities and other interested agencies to raise public awareness and to promote radon testing and remediation works.  This multi-agency approach to dealing with radon is in line with international best practice.</P>

    <Sect LHead="Grant" RHead="Payments"> 
      <sTitle>Grant Payments.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked for this issue to be debated in the light of the failure of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to pay farmers in Kerry, and in other counties, the money they are due under REPS 4.  At present only 466 of 1,960 applicants in Kerry have been fully paid.  That is less than 25% of all applicants.  For the other 1,494 farmers who have not yet received their payment this represents a considerable setback at a time when farm incomes are already under severe pressure.  In most instances farmers in receipt of REPS are on the lower income bracket.  Given that they were led to believe their payments would have been received prior to Christmas, many farmers were dependent on having their money for Christmas so that they could make some sort of Christmas for their families.  However, in my county, Kerry, and in many others that has not been the case.  Many farmers borrowed money to carry out farm improvements and other work, but now find themselves unable to meet repayments on time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The situation throughout the rest of the country is that almost 55% of applicants are in the same position.  That amounts to nearly 16,000 farm households who have been let down and many of them are those who can least afford a further financial setback at this time.  Kerry, for some reason has the third highest percentage of applicants who have not been paid, with only Waterford and Wicklow having a worse payment record.  When I raised two cases in parliamen<Col N="95"/>tary questions last week the reply stated this was due to administrative problems in processing the claim.  Surely that cannot be the case in so many individual cases and across such a large group in every county.  One of the replies I received stated that payment issued to applicants whose applications required no further examination following administrative checks, but that queries arose in those checks for a significant number of applicants.  I have been told by agents who work on behalf of applicants that in previous years applications with the same wording to the letter gave rise to no query.  It is no wonder that many farmers are questioning the motivation behind the failure to make these payments.  Some of them suspect the Government is doing it deliberately in order to save money and others are questioning whether adequate staff are available in the Department offices in Tralee to process the applications.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will explain the nature of the problems that have arisen so that 1,494 Kerry farmers will be able to do what is necessary in order to receive their payments.  Do the problems relate to the manner in which the forms were submitted?  Is there a priority list regarding the submission of forms?  If so, surely enough time has passed since the applications were received for such problems to have been identified and addressed.  Is it the case that problems within the Department regarding staff shortages and so on are responsible?  I know there have been staff changes in the Tralee office.  Is this a contributing factor?  Whatever the reason it still does not explain why the Minister has failed to honour the commitment he made last year that the payment process would have moved well beyond this by now.  The specific undertaking was that payments would begin on 14 December and be completed in January.  That has not happened.</P>
        <P>The Minister therefore must honour his promise to these farmers, many of whom are experiencing real hardship, and ensure that the payments are made as a matter of urgency.  Many of those farmers in Kerry have loans and mortgages from the bank, which were given on the understanding that REPS payments would be received to clear off what is outstanding.  I ask the Minister to give the matter his immediate attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to clarify the situation.  Any farmer in REPS 4 whose application has been processed for payment has been paid already, not only in Kerry but also throughout the country.  I assure the House that the Department will continue to process applications to payment stage as a priority.</P>
        <P>The first payments for the 2009 REPS 4 scheme year issued on 18 December 2009 and payments have continued to issue in the meantime.  To date some 9,823 REPS 4 participants have been paid in full.  A further 4,508 have received the first phase of 75% of their payments and are due to receive the balancing payment of 25% shortly.  Payments will go out this week to a further 1,300 applicants.  In Kerry, there are 2,039 REPS 4 participants of whom 462 have received payments.  A further 143 have been cleared for payment and payment will issue this week.</P>
        <P>I am well aware of the importance of REPS payments to farmers and farm family incomes, especially at this difficult time.  However, the Department has to operate in the context of strict EU regulations.  These regulations require that detailed administrative checks be carried out on all applications before any payment can be made.  The position, in Kerry as elsewhere, is that queries arose in the course of checks on a significant number of applications.  The queries arise under a range of issues including area measurement and nutrient management plans.  Where queries arise, Department staff are working to resolve the issues as quickly as possible so that payments can be made with the minimum of delay.  In many cases, it will be necessary for officials to contact farmers directly about their applications and a number of farm plans have already been sent back to applicants to be amended in line with the terms of the scheme.  Amended plans will be processed for payment without delay.</P><Col N="96"/>
        <P>The current situation should not in any way detract from the merits of REPS.  The scheme has been one of the most successful operated by the Department since its launch in 1994.  It has delivered multiple benefits to the environment in terms of water quality, biodiversity, conservation and landscape enhancement.  It has also brought welcome income benefits to farmers, with more than &euro;342 million paid out to REPS participants last year and a total of more than &euro;2 billion paid since 1994.  Payments in 2009 reached their highest level ever.  The original allocation for last year was just &euro;330 million but additional funds were provided in December last and approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  Payments due to REPS farmers this year will continue at this high level.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the Government&rsquo;s decision to close REPS to new entrants in July of last year, which was unavoidable given the state of the public finances, those farmers who are already in REPS will see out their five-year contracts.  This means that there will still be farmers in REPS right up to the end of 2014.  By the time the scheme finally comes to an end, payments to farmers will have exceeded &euro;3 billion.</P>
        <P>Last Wednesday in Brussels, the Rural Development Management Committee of the European Commission agreed to an amendment to Ireland&rsquo;s rural development programme.  Part of this amendment included proposals for a new agri-environment scheme.  This scheme will be funded partly by the EU but will also get very substantial support from the Irish taxpayer.  The new scheme will focus on the priority areas of biodiversity, climate change and water management.  It will consist of a menu of actions from which farmers can select those that complement the environmental profiles of their farms.  The shape of the new scheme reflects the increasing emphasis at EU level on having schemes that deliver clearly identifiable and measurable benefits to the environment and to society.  Details of the operation of the new scheme are being finalised within the Department and the intention is to launch it once the formal approval of the European Commission has been received.</P>
        <P>REPS is of course not the only scheme contributing to farmers&rsquo; cash flow at present.  Yesterday, the Department started payments under the 2009 suckler welfare scheme.  These payments will be worth &euro;30 million in respect of 2009-born calves for the 53,000 applicants in the scheme and payments will continue into 2010.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Earlier this month, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, authorised payments of a further &euro;190 million in grants to farmers under the farm waste management scheme.  This expenditure was in addition to the &euro;49 million already paid out by the Department by way of the second tranche of grant aid under the scheme towards the end of 2009.  Total Exchequer funding for this scheme now exceeds &euro;1 billion.  All participants in the scheme have now received at least 80% of the payments due and many have been paid in full.  I assure the House that the Minister will continue to implement schemes and services to support farm incomes and that, in the case of REPS, will continue with efforts to expedite payments to all participants.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue regarding a proper water supply for St. Brigid&rsquo;s girls&rsquo; national school in Killester, Dublin 5.  I am here tonight to support the parents, pupils and teachers on this urgent matter.  The school needs support and I call on the Minister to provide the funding to St. Brigid&rsquo;s to deal with the water issue, the tanks issue and above all to ensure that the school has a safe and regular supply of water so that the teachers and pupils can get on with their work.  The background to this issue is the recent water crisis in the Killester area.  The residents <Col N="97"/>in the area suffered major problems with water supply and many people had to go without water for days, which is unacceptable.  The Minister needs to ensure that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Dublin City Council get their act together and provide for a long-term solution for the water issue in the Killester area.</P>
        <P>Were it not for people like Independent Councillor Damian O&rsquo;Farrell and his team who did an excellent job going around Killester with his trailer and 25-litre containers of water, many more would have suffered.  The long-term water issue in Killester must be resolved as well as the school issue.</P>
        <P>St. Brigid&rsquo;s girls&rsquo; national school was forced to close because of lack of water.  Its tanks are outdated and it urgently needs a new water system to ensure the smooth running of the school.  The principal and the board of management has applied to the Department for the funding to resolve this issue.  I urge the Minister to release the funding to St. Brigid&rsquo;s.  This is an urgent appeal and now is the time to act.</P>
        <P>This would be of major assistance to the pupils and the school.  It would remove the uncertainty of not knowing whether they will have water and all the toilets, wash-hand basins and sinks would be working properly.  This would have a positive impact on the school and above all, ensure the smooth running of the educational service there.  I again urge the Minister to support the school with the funding.  It is ready to roll at the moment.  I am here tonight representing the people of Killester and hundreds of families in the area.  I urge the Minister to listen to their request for funding to ensure a constant and safe water supply to St. Brigid&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>This is not a major educational issue alone, but also a major health and safety issue.  Funding from the Department is the solution in helping this school.  It needs proper tanks and a safe supply of water to ensure it is run on a proper professional basis.  A school cannot be run without water.</P>
        <P>Finally, I urge the Minister to act now, not to put matters on the long finger, and grant this funding to Killester girls&rsquo; national school as a matter of urgency.</P>

        <P>I am happy to outline to the House the Department&rsquo;s position regarding a proposed application for capital grant aid for emergency works by St. Brigid&rsquo;s girls&rsquo; national school, Killester.  The main purpose of the emergency works scheme is to ensure the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools most in need of resources as a result of an unforeseen event of a capital nature that can arise during the course of a school year.  The application process requires the provision to the Department of specific relevant information to enable a verifiable, speedy and equitable assessment and decision.</P>
        <P>Primary and post-primary schools requiring capital grant aid for emergency works in the current year must apply under this scheme.  The purpose of the scheme is solely for unforeseen emergencies which cannot be funded by the school&rsquo;s own resources.  All relevant and supporting information in regard to an application must be provided in order to support a claim for grant-aid under this scheme.  All applications are dealt with on an individual basis.</P>
        <P>I understand that the school authority has been in telephone contact with the building unit of the Department concerning a problem with the water tanks.  I further understand that an application for emergency funding will be submitted in the near future.  When this application is received it will be assessed without delay and the school authorities will be notified of the outcome.  I can confirm to the Deputy that the school has applied for funding for water con<Col N="98"/>servation measures.  This application was made under the terms of the summer works scheme for 2010.</P>
        <P>When the Minister announced details of this scheme last year, he said that he was anxious to help schools to conserve water and keep their water bills as low as possible now that full water charges are on the way.  He introduced a new category under the 2010 summer works scheme to address this issue.</P>
        <P>The most appropriate water conservation design approaches have been identified by the Department for many years and form part of the standard low energy school designs that are used when new schools or major extensions are being built.  The Minister now wants to focus on existing buildings to minimise, as far as possible, the impact of water charges on all school budgets.  Specific simple and straightforward measures have been identified by the Department which should minimise excess consumption of water and reduce wastage.  These measures will also contribute to the Government&rsquo;s national targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
        <P>The water conservation measures will be funded as part of the usual broader summer works scheme to make structural and other improvements to school buildings while pupils are on their holidays.  The closing date for the receipt of applications under the summer works scheme for 2010 was 27 November 2009.  The applications received, including that from the school in question, are now being assessed.</P>
        <P>In keeping with the timetable published with the governing circular letter for the scheme, the Minister expects to be in a position to publish the list of successful applicants in the spring.  I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has statutory responsibility for grid connection offers and for oversight of EirGrid&rsquo;s grid connection process including the Gate process for renewable energy.</P>
        <P>There is currently over 1,500 megawatts (MWS) of renewable generation capacity connected to the electricity grid.  Wind powered technology is the dominant renewable technology.  Over 100 individual windfarms have been connected with a combined capacity of 1,260 MWs.  240 MWs of hydro-power are connected.  The balance represents biomass plants mainly landfill gas.</P>
        <P>The contribution from renewable energy connected to the electricity grid is increasing very steadily from year to year.  Renewable generation contributed 11.9% of all electricity consumed in 2008 compared to just 4.4% in 2003.  Ireland is on schedule to meet the 15% target for electricity from renewable sources for this year.</P>
        <P>In addition to projects already built and connected, a further 1400 MWs of capacity have already signed grid connection offers and have been accepted into the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff (REFIT) programme.</P>
        <P>These projects were part of the Gate 1 and Gate 2 processes, and will be built and connected to the grid over the next two or three year period.</P>
        <P>The CER and EirGrid have calculated that around 5,800 megawatts (MWs) of renewable capacity will be required in total to deliver the 40% target in 2020.</P><Col N="100"/>
        <P>The CER decision on the &lsquo;Gate 3&rsquo; round provides for connection offers for an additional 4,000 MW of renewable electricity capacity.  Approximately 90% of these offers are wind powered capacity including around 800 MW of offshore wind.  The Gate 3 decisions, combined with existing renewable energy capacity and projects currently being built and connected, point to the 40% target being met by 2020.</P>
        <P>The projects in Gate 3 were selected by the CER on a &ldquo;first come first served&rdquo; criterion.  Grid connection offers for projects within the Gate 3 process began to issue last month and will continue to be issued on a phased basis until mid 2011.</P>
        <P>To ensure this process operates efficiently and to keep the industry stakeholders informed of the ongoing work, the CER has established a Gate 3 Liaison Group involving all stakeholders, including EirGrid and the renewable industry associations.  The objective is to ensure the connection offer process is completed quickly, transparently and effectively.</P>
        <P>The Gate 3 process was extensively consulted on by the CER.  Through public consultation and dedicated industry workshops, all industry stakeholders were given the opportunity of responding in advance to the proposed connection process.</P>
        <P>In the event of any non take-up of the Gate 3 offers, the CER would intend to add replacement projects currently in the queue, to ensure delivery of the 2020 target.</P>
        <P>A strategic framework to deliver on the potential for exporting renewable electricity from Ireland is also a key priority.  This will take account of grid technology developments, power flow management techniques, and progressive interconnection with the UK, and potentially Europe.  In that context Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the North Seas Countries Offshore Grid Initiative and involvement in other EU offshore wind fora will ensure that Ireland is at the forefront of European developments in offshore renewable energy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100, 124 and 146 together.</P>
        <P>The Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme which is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), provides grant assistance to homeowners for energy efficiency retrofitting measures including attic and wall insulation, very high-efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.</P>
        <P>The scheme is open to anybody owning a house that was built prior to 2006.  Homeowners can expect to save up to &euro;700 per year on their energy bills if they install the full suite of <Col N="101"/>measures available under the scheme.  The scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the typical cost of energy efficiency upgrade measures, depending on the measure concerned.</P>
        <P>The scheme, which was launched in March 2009, had attracted 40,724 applications by the end of December 2009.  Some &euro;16.26 million was paid out by SEI by the end of the year, representing 33,434 energy efficient measures installed in 18,183 homes.  The scheme allows homeowners six months, from the date of grant approval, to have the work undertaken.  In the first three weeks of January there have been an average of 1,300 applications per week and some &euro;2.5m has been paid out in HES grants in that period.</P>
        <P>The National Energy Retrofit Programme, announced on Budget Day, will further reduce energy costs and carbon emissions in homes and business while also creating employment and developing a sustainable market for energy services in Ireland.  The detailed design and specification of the new programme is being finalised by my Department and SEI.  The Programme will be the subject of a public consultation in the near future.  In broad terms the Retrofit Programme will bring together the HES and the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), as well as support programmes for business and the public sector.  It will also involve the development and promotion of energy services by the energy companies.</P>
        <P>This new Programme has the potential to be the most innovative, ambitious, energy-related initiative ever introduced in Ireland.  It will significantly reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and contribute to meeting the national efficiency targets including the target of 33% set for the public sector.  It will also create significant employment in the energy and construction sectors in support of economic renewal.</P>
        <P>It is important to stress that pending the introduction of the Retrofit Programme, the HES and the WHS are fully open for business in 2010 with applications being received and processed by SEI.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 107 and 126 together.</P>
        <P>Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the development of digital terrestrial television (DTT) in Ireland and for the closure of the national analogue TV network.</P>
        <P>This Act requires RT&Eacute; to provide a national &lsquo;free to air&rsquo; digital service with capacity to carry RT&Eacute; 1, RTE 2, TG4 and TV3 by the end of 2011 or such later date as I may specify.  The RT&Eacute; <Col N="102"/>&lsquo;free to air&rsquo; digital service is to replace the existing analogue terrestrial television service and I wish to make it clear, at this stage, that it is my intention that the date stipulated in the Broadcasting Act for the &lsquo;free to air&rsquo; DTT launch should be met.</P>
        <P>In addition, the 2009 Act requires the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), an independent regulatory authority, to provide for the development of commercial digital terrestrial television services.</P>
        <P>On foot of this requirement, the BAI&rsquo;s predecessor, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI), launched a competition, which is still ongoing.  As the Deputy is aware, the highest placed consortium in the competition withdrew from the process last April.  Negotiations then commenced with the next placed bidder and this process is continuing.</P>
        <P>As I stated recently in response to a previous question on this issue, I am not prepared to speculate on the outcome of the commercial DTT process, which is a matter for the BAI and one in which I have no role.  Nor am I prepared to surmise on the ongoing negotiations between the BAI, RT&Eacute; and the OneVision consortium.  I have, however, made clear my view that I would like to see this process concluded as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The conclusion of the process is essential to provide certainty for broadcasters, suppliers and the general public with regard to the development of commercial DTT services in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In relation to the rollout of DTT services, I am informed by RT&Eacute; that, to date, 13 sites have been upgraded to accommodate the single &lsquo;free to air&rsquo; DTT multiplex and also three commercial DTT multiplexes.</P>
        <P>I have been informed that the capital expenditure undertaken by RT&Eacute; on DTT to date, is estimated at &euro;31.5m.</P>
        <P>Under section 129 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 RT&Eacute; is required to ensure that &lsquo;free-to-air&rsquo; DTT is available to 90% of the population on such date as may be specified by the Minister.  RT&Eacute; has indicated a preference for launching &lsquo;free-to-air&rsquo; DTT in parallel with a commercial DTT operator as RT&Eacute; believes that the availability of commercial DTT is important to assist it in getting a return on its investment and to ensure adequate viewer choice in the digital era.  However, a commercial DTT service, while offering more choice to the viewer, is not an essential element in providing for analogue switch off.</P>
        <P>As I have previously stated, my policy objective is the earliest possible switch-off of the analogue TV system operated by RT&Eacute;NL and it is my intention that this will be no later that quarter four 2012.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I have established a group to advise me on planning for analogue switch-off and related matters.</P>
        <P>The Analogue Switch-off Group includes representatives of the BAI, ComReg, RT&Eacute; and my own Department.  I expect to be presented with the group&rsquo;s recommendations within the coming weeks and when I have considered them I will announce the precise dates for the availability of &lsquo;free-to-air&rsquo; DTT and analogue switch-off.</P>
        <P>The timely switch-off of analogue broadcast services will release valuable spectrum and will position Ireland to maximise the benefits of the resulting digital dividend.</P>

	<P>The sustainable development of indigenous bioenergy resources is critical to meeting EU and national targets for renewable heat, electricity and transport.  Anaerobic digestion technology offers the possibility of generating renewable electricity and heat from a variety of waste materials.  It will also contribute to the Government&rsquo;s policy objectives in a number of related fields, not least waste management, rural development and pollution control in groundwater.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, through its Research Stimulus Fund, has supported a significant amount of research in bioenergy including anaerobic digestion (AD) projects.  My Department is also funding a number of projects under the Charles Parsons Awards specifically addressing biogas and biowaste potential.  These include work by the Bioresources Research Centre (BRC) in University College Dublin into small scale gasification and the optimisation of AD processes in biowastes.  The University of Limerick is also carrying out a range of bioenergy research under the Charles Parsons Awards including the thermochemical conversion by biowaste.</P>
        <P>Science Foundation Ireland has taken over the administration of the Charles Parsons Awards in recent months.  The Renewable Energy Information Office (REIO) of Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has been actively advising on the potential opportunities associated with anaerobic digestion technology.</P>
        <P>There is growing interest in the economic potential of the technology given not least the large potential supply market in the agricultural and industrial sectors.</P>
        <P>Supports are also available for the development of Anaerobic Digestion plants.  The Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Deployment Programme, administered by SEI, was opened for Biomass and Anaerobic Digestion CHP applications in January 2008.</P>
        <P>The Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) for biomass and anaerobic digestion CHP of 12 cent per kilowatt hour, will support the development of the sector.  Six applications have been received to date.  Under the auspices of the Renewable Energy Development Group, the Bioenergy Working Group, which is chaired by my Department and includes industry stakeholders, is currently finalising a Bioenergy Road Map to 2020 to underpin the development of bioenergy, including biomass and AD over the next decade.  The Working Group is scheduled to submit a report to me by March next.</P>
        <P>A number of AD plants are now under construction, some of which will primarily use animal waste and others, which will use biodegradable municipal and household waste.  There are at least nine additional AD plants currently seeking planning permission.  This level of potential investment underlines the growing interest in potential of anaerobic digestion technology.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103, 121, 125 and 135 together.  </P>
        <P>The Smart Metering Project is progressing well in line with the commitment in the Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government.  The Smart Metering Project is a central component of the strategy to radically enhance management of energy demand, create smart networks and deliver greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.</P>
        <P>Smart Metering is also now seen at European Union level as a critical dimension of energy demand management in the interests of consumers and businesses.  At the recent informal meeting of EU Energy Ministers, the Spanish Presidency and the Commission both confirmed the importance of moving ahead with smart meter programmes across Europe.  I am pleased to say that Ireland is to the forefront among Member States in our progress on the smart meter agenda.</P>
        <P>The national smart metering programme covers both electricity and gas.  The pilot phase of the project, which encompasses technology and customer behaviour trials, is under way to schedule.  Technology trials are testing a number of advanced metering systems and their associated IT and communications infrastructure.  Customer behaviour trials are determining the potential of smart meters to achieve measurable change in consumer behaviour.  The trials are essential to ensure that the optimum and most cost effective technology and systems are identified for the implementation phase.</P>
        <P>The electricity trials will be completed to schedule at the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The electricity technology trial is assessing metering functionality and supporting information and communications systems.  Installation of up to 5,000 meters has commenced for technology testing in Limerick/Ennis, Cork City/Bandon and South Dublin/Wicklow.</P>
        <P>6,500 participants for the electricity customer behaviour trial have been selected.  The group has been selected to ensure that all categories of electricity consumers are represented, both in terms of usage profiles and geographical spread.  All meters being used for this trial have been collecting baseline data since 1 July 2009.  The trial went live on 1 January this year.</P>
        <P>The Customer Behaviour Trial covers both domestic users and SME&rsquo;s.  Domestic customers make up the bulk of the trial.  It has been agreed that only ESB Customer Supply customers will be involved in the domestic consumer trial due to the costs involved in replicating IT systems.  Customers of ESB Customer Supply, Bord G&aacute;is and ESB Independent Energy are involved in the SME trial.  The independent suppliers elected not to take part in the pilot phase but they are being kept fully apprised of progress.</P><Col N="105"/>
        <P>The specifications of the metering systems allows the testing of a range of parameters.  These include interval metering reading, time of use tariffing and the use of In Home Display devices.  They will also provide reliable quality data on actual energy use patterns.  This information will lead to significantly better services to consumers including, improved fault monitoring and outage recording, power quality monitoring, reduced theft and losses and improved network planning.</P>
        <P>The gas element of the pilot phase is also moving ahead.  1,925 meters have been installed for the Customer Behaviour Trial and have been collecting data since 1 December.  A further 500 meters will be installed to facilitate the Gas Technology Trials.  These trials will go live next June and will continue until May 2011.</P>
        <P>The smart metering pilot project is proceeding in parallel with the work by Sustainable Energy Ireland and ESB on microgeneration.  The data gathered from the interval meters being used in the microgeneration scheme will provide vital information on the import and export of electricity.  This will feed into the analysis of electricity use under the smart metering pilot project.  In turn, the findings of the smart metering pilot will inform the development of a long term microgeneration framework.</P>
        <P>The total estimated cost of the smart meter pilot project is approximately &euro;35m which encompasses &euro;30m for the electricity element and &euro;5m for the gas element.  The costs of the national roll out will be quantified in light of the results of the pilot project and decisions taken on the most cost effective smart metering/ICT system to deliver the level of functionality required in the Irish market.</P>
        <P>In that context a fundamental element of the pilot project is the associated cost benefit analysis.  An interim analysis will be completed later this year with the final analysis, to include the results of the gas trials, to be completed by mid next year.  The outcome of this cost benefit analysis will critically inform future decisions on the national roll-out of smart meters.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 119 together.</P>
        <P>The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive has set a 10% target for Renewable Energy in Transport for all Member States by 2020.  The approach taken by Ireland to deliver on this target will ensure that there is sustainable development of an Irish biofuels market in line with overall EU biofuel policy criteria.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the National Biofuel Obligation this year will underpin delivery of the national biofuel target and the development of the Irish biofuels market.  The Biofuel Obligation Bill to give effect to the obligation will be published shortly with a view to its introduction in the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.</P><Col N="106"/>
        <P>The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes have already supported the development of indigenous production.  Under the Obligation fuel suppliers will be legally required to include an average of 4% biofuels in their overall annual fuel sales.  The Obligation, by creating a guaranteed market demand, will of itself stimulate and support the supply of Irish sourced biofuels.  It will act therefore as an incentive for market production and give the Irish biofuel industry economic certainty.</P>
        <P>The trading of certificates under the Scheme, will also act as an incentive for Irish producers.  For each litre of biofuel sold in the market a certificate will be issued by the National Oil Reserves Agency as the Administrator of the scheme.  Certificates will also be subject to verification by sellers to demonstrate that they meet the sustainability criteria.  Biofuel obligation certificates may be traded among registered operators.  I am confident tradability of these certificates will enable small indigenous producers, in particular, to enter the market and develop their businesses.</P>
        <P>The development of EU biofuel sustainability criteria regime was overseen by a special &ldquo;ad hoc&rdquo; Committee, which comprised all Member States and the Commission.  My Department participated in the work of the committee.  The criteria are duly reflected in the Renewable Energy Directive, which was agreed by Council and the European Parliament in mid 2009.  They will also be an integral part of the National Biofuels Obligation scheme. The Commission is finalising its guidance document on the implementation of the criteria including reporting and verification requirements.  These will also be reflected in into the National Obligation Scheme.</P>

	<P>The Broadcasting Act, 2009 contains measures designed to support community broadcasting.</P>
        <P>The Act provides for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), an independent statutory body, to prepare a scheme for the granting of funds to support certain categories of new television or sound broadcasting programmes.</P>
        <P>One of the objectives of the scheme is to develop local and community broadcasting.  The funds are granted through the Broadcasting Fund which is administered by the BAI.  Under the 2009 Act the allocation for the Fund was increased from 5% to 7% of net television licence fee receipts.</P>
        <P>The Act also requires the BAI to facilitate the transmission of community broadcasting services by entering into &ldquo;community content provision contracts&rdquo; with community interests.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 111 and 130 together.</P>
        <P>The Government has ambitious plans for the large scale deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  We have set a target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020 and all relevant Departments and Agencies are working together to ensure that the necessary policies and infrastructure are in place to meet this target.</P>
        <P>Electric vehicles are an increasingly realistic solution to the challenge of reducing the transport sector&rsquo;s Greenhouse Gas Emissions and reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels.  There is now very significant global investment under way in research and development in this area.  The technology is maturing to a point where large scale commercial deployment appears feasible in the short to medium term.  There is keen interest internationally in Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to be an early mover in this field.  Ireland is seen as an excellent test-bed particularly in relation to network infrastructure development.</P>
        <P>In the European Union context, I have welcomed the commitment of the Spanish Presidency to place electric vehicles firmly on the EU energy policy agenda.  The Presidency, together with Ireland, Denmark and Portugal, underlined the real opportunities for Europe to transform energy use in transport at the informal meeting of Energy Ministers in Seville on 15 January.  We agreed that the development of electric vehicles technology and standards should be progressed by the European Union as part of delivery of energy efficient and low carbon systems.  In the discussion, I highlighted the need for economic incentives to support market entry as well as common standards.  The Commission also confirmed that electric vehicles will be included as a priority under the Strategic Energy Technology Plan.</P>
        <P>The challenge now for Ireland is to develop a cost efficient electric vehicle infrastructure network, together with measures to develop a market for the vehicles themselves.</P>
        <P>ESB Networks is playing a central role in the development of the infrastructure network.  Initial estimates by ESB Networks for the roll out of infrastructure are between 6 and 18 months depending on the scale of initial deployment.  The company has already begun installing the first 20 charging points.  ESB is also playing a leading role in work by European utilities and car manufacturers to progress essential standardisation across Europe.  I was pleased to get confirmation from the Commission at the informal Energy Ministers meeting that it also has begun work on standardisation.</P>
        <P>The Inter Departmental/Inter Agency Taskforce has reported on the costed options and timeframes for putting in place the necessary infrastructure and other arrangements for the cost effective deployment of electric vehicles on a national basis.  Global and EU developments will be factored in as the technologies mature.</P>
        <P>I am currently reviewing the report of the Taskforce with a view to bringing it to Government in the near future for agreement to setting a clear roadmap ahead.</P><Col N="108"/>
        <P>My Department and the ESB have agreed a Memorandum of Understanding with Renault-Nissan, which provides for ongoing information exchange on developments.  Discussions are under way with a number of other car manufacturers, with a view to developing Memoranda of Understanding, with them also.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance confirmed in Budget 2010 the Government&rsquo;s commitment to encourage the increased use of environmentally friendly electric cars and related technology development.  To that end the VRT exemption for electric vehicles and the VRT reliefs of up to &euro;2,500 for plug-in hybrid vehicles are being extended until end 2012.  The Minister for Finance also gave a commitment to bring forward support to offset the initial battery costs for electric vehicles, the details of which are currently being progressed. This scheme is intended to incentivise up to 11,000 electric vehicles to come onto the Irish market over the next three years.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 133 and 142 together.</P>
        <P>The establishment of a &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; is one of the commitments in the Next Generation Broadband policy paper &ldquo;Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland&rdquo;, which I published in June last year.</P>
        <P>The concept of a &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; arose from a recognition that there is added value to be had from facilitating telecoms operators in gaining access to ducting in State owned networks, thereby ensuring optimal use of State assets and facilitating more cost-effective roll out of broadband.  The context to the proposal is the anticipated increase in demand for high speed broadband into the future.</P>
        <P>My Department has had consultations with the telecoms operators and has also engaged with the relevant State Bodies who are generally supportive of the proposal.  My Department has also undertaken an initial survey of State-owned networks and has published a series of maps showing the routes of infrastructure such as roads, electricity, gas and rail.</P>
        <P>A further development in progressing the thinking behind the concept has been the publication of the Premium Rate Services Bill, which contains an amendment to the Communi<Col N="109"/>cations (Regulation) Act 2002 whereby the National Roads Authority will provide a formal framework to make ducts on national roads and motorways accessible to telecommunications companies.  This Bill, which has cleared all stages in the D&aacute;il, is currently before the Seanad and I anticipate that it will be quickly enacted.</P>
        <P>The first key requirement is that operators have up-to-date information about the availability and quality of State-owned ducting and access arrangements.  Some information is available on this as a result of the initial survey of infrastructure undertaken by my Department and further elaboration is needed in order to meet the specific needs of operators.  The immediate objective is to have information on the availability of and access arrangements for all State-owned ducting via a single contact point later this year.</P>
        <P>At the same time we will evaluate and progress the best management system that will provide co-ordinated access to such State-owned ducting.</P>
        <P>Such a management system should facilitate our wider objective of promoting co-operation between different telecoms providers of backhaul and wholesale services while at the same time not undermining competition in the market.</P>

	<P>Over half of the gas consumed in the EU comes from sources outside Europe.  A key security of supply imperative for Europe is to ensure diversification of supply routes and sources of gas. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) increasingly is a component of this strategy as Member States <Col N="110"/>work to diversify supply sources and routes.  LNG imports account for approximately 15% of the total EU gas market and currently represents the main supply source of gas for the Iberian Peninsula although demand has declined with the Spanish recession.  LNG supplies to North West Europe have increased in line with the coming on-stream in 2009 of new LNG facilities in UK, Italy and elsewhere, the current competitive price of LNG on world markets and increased availability of supplies.  The gas market generally and the LNG market in particular is much less volatile than in 2007 or 2008.</P>
        <P>LNG supplies to Europe are currently sourced from Norway, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Trinidad and Tobago, Qatar, Oman and Malaysia.  Most of these countries are seen as largely stable political regions.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s demand for gas is met almost entirely by imports across the gas interconnectors from the UK.  A declining production and storage at Kinsale, now supplying around 4%, accounts for the remainder.  Irish imports account for around 5% of the UK gas market.  The vast bulk of UK gas demand is currently being met by indigenous North Sea production and imports from Norway.<b>  </b>Through the gas interconnectors Ireland has access to diverse sources of supply including UK indigenous production, Norwegian imports and physical interconnection with mainland Europe.  The UK has access to worldwide LNG markets through its significant recent investment in LNG terminals and LNG plays an increasingly important part in UK&rsquo;s gas supplies.</P>
        <P>It is prudent, in light of Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on gas imported from the UK, to work to reduce our reliance on this source.  In addition to the work to bring Corrib gas production on stream, opportunities for LNG and for gas storage are being developed.</P>
        <P>The island of Ireland currently has no LNG import capability. An LNG import terminal is being developed by Shannon LNG on the Shannon estuary.  The proposed &lsquo;merchant&rsquo; LNG terminal would provide additional security of supply for Ireland in that it would bring diversity to our supply sources and would bring connectivity for the first time to the global LNG market.  The prospect of such a facility is therefore a potentially positive step for the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Shannon LNG has been awarded planning permission for an LNG import facility and terminal under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.</P>
        <P>The safety standards applying to an LNG facility are primarily the responsibilities of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) and the Commission for Energy Regulation both of whom have stringent regulations and standards in place under the EC Seveso Directive and other EU Regulations.</P>

        <Quest> the new measures he will take to ensure that the cost of energy here is tackled in view of concerns expressed by the commercial sector on the high cost of energy and his failure to tackle this high cost for business; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s high energy costs, by comparison with much of Europe, are primarily due to significant dependence on imported fossil fuels, particularly gas, as well a requirement for very significant investment in energy infrastructure, following two decades of under-investment in the networks.  The under-investment in networks and power generation posed real risks to security of supply which had become a major concern for enterprise.  Structural challenges, including peripherality, a small and widely dispersed population and lack of economies of scale in power generation, also contribute to a higher energy cost base in Ireland than in competitor countries.</P>
        <P>In the current economic climate, indigenous business and the inward investment community are concerned about energy costs. In response to this, the Government has put in place a number of measures to mitigate the cost of energy for business.</P>
        <P>These measures, which include significant rebates to electricity consumers, have had a significant impact on our competitive position in energy terms.  According to the latest statistics on European energy cost competitiveness, as published recently in Sustainable Energy Ireland&rsquo;s report &mdash; &ldquo;Understanding Electricity &amp; Gas Prices in Ireland&rdquo;, Ireland registered the third largest price drop in electricity prices to industry over the 12 month period ending 30 June 2009.  At the same time, 22 of the 27 EU countries experienced price increases.  It is also the case that some of the larger industrial customers in Ireland paid less for electricity in Ireland than equivalent customers in Britain in the first half of 2009.</P>
        <P>In addition, gas prices to Irish business with medium consumption levels have been falling since early 2008 and fell by 15.8% in the year to end June 2009.  Gas prices to business in Ireland for the first half of 2009 were 7% to 10% below the EU average in the two main midrange consumption bands and just 1% above the EU average in the next highest band.</P>
        <P>Working with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), my Department is also investigating the scope for further permanent structural changes to our electricity tariffs that will benefit business.  Changes under consideration include some rebalancing of network tariffs from next autumn, as well as the possibility of recovering carbon windfall gains from electricity generators.</P>
        <P>The CER has also commenced work on a 5-year review of electricity network expenditure.  These reviews are designed to ensure that ESB and EirGrid make even greater efficiencies in operational and capital expenditure, thus driving down costs to all consumers.  I am confident that CER will ensure that this review is very rigorous in the interests of mitigating energy costs.</P>
        <P>Competition among suppliers is a critical means of exerting downward pressure on electricity prices and also towards ensuring diversity of energy supply to reduce our exposure to high and <Col N="112"/>volatile external energy prices.  Significant progress has been made to date, most notably with the all-island Single Electricity Market now in place, the sale of ESB generation capacity, the entry of new players and new generation capacity coming on-stream in the Irish market.</P>
        <P>The development of supplier competition in the Large Energy User (LEU) market has meant that since 2006 the CER no longer regulates prices for this sector. ESB Customer Supply now supplies less than 10% of this market.  The four main independent suppliers are Energia, Bord G&aacute;is, Airtricity and the independent ESB Independent Energy.  The Enterprise community has acknowledged that there is healthy competition in the LEU supply market with the suppliers very actively competing for customers.</P>
        <P>There is also active competition between electricity suppliers in the SME market and companies can avail of discounts of up to 10% &mdash; 20% simply by switching suppliers.  Already approximately 60% of SMEs have made this switch and are experiencing the benefits.</P>
        <P>Energy support programmes, offered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), are proving very successful in helping businesses reduce their energy usage and hence their costs.  In the past two years SEI has given free advice and training to over 1,500 businesses in the SME sector and has advised that every single business has identified immediate savings, typically greater than 10% of costs.  Total business cost savings from the programme already total close to &euro;60 million per annum, which is in addition to savings of a similar scale in the SEI Large Industry Energy Network.</P>
        <P>Firms in this network include some of Ireland&rsquo;s major employers and represent a significant proportion of Irish export income as well as accounting for 61% of all industrial energy use.  In addition to the significant annual savings achieved by firms in this network, Irish industry is also developing an international reputation for its energy efficiency achievements.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 118 together.</P>
        <P>The Government has set a target of achieving 20% energy efficiency savings across the economy in 2020.  As part of this energy efficiency drive, the Government has also committed to achieving a 33% energy saving across the public sector by 2020.</P>
        <P>The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) sets out 90 actions that Government is either already taking or will take in the period to 2020 to achieve the national energy efficiency targets.  The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately &euro;1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.  An inter departmental/agency group will oversee the implementation of all NEEAP measures.  Reporting, verification of savings and communication of progress towards the 2020 targets including the public sector target will be key outputs from this group.</P><Col N="113"/>
        <P>The key NEEAP actions undertaken to date are as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><?oasys _ix ?>The Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme, which is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), was launched in March 2009.  The scheme provides grant assistance to homeowners for energy efficiency retro-fitting measures including attic and wall insulation, very high-efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><?oasys _ix ?>The scheme is open to anybody owning a house that was built prior to 2006.  Homeowners can expect to save up to &euro;700 per year on their energy bills if they install the full suite of measures available under the scheme.  The scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the typical cost of energy efficiency upgrade measures, depending on the measure concerned.  The scheme had attracted 40,724 applications by the end of December 2009.  In total, 33,434 energy efficient measures were installed in 18,183 homes in 2009.</P>
     <P LI="1" el="5"><?oasys _ix ?>The Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) provides support for low income housing for insulation and other energy efficiency improvement measures.  This scheme is also managed by SEI and implemented by local community groups.  Measures include cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, boiler lagging jackets, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs).  These measures are provided free or at a nominal cost to the householder.  Advice is also provided on minimising energy use.  Some &euro;20 million was provided for the scheme in 2009, which included a contribution of &euro;5 million from ESB and BGE.  This enabled energy efficiency improvements to be made in over 19,000 vulnerable homes in 2009, effectively doubling the total number of homes benefitting under the scheme in the previous ten years.</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><?oasys _ix ?>In the business sector, the most significant cost-cutting and energy saving potential lies in improving the energy performance requirements of new non-residential buildings, improvement of existing buildings, encouraging more businesses and public bodies to actively address their energy use and to use the most energy efficient plant, machinery and equipment.  In 2009, SEI delivered a &euro;5 million programme that provided grant assistance to the business and public sectors.  The programme supports energy efficiency measures for businesses and institutions across the country.  Over 74 projects have been funded under the programme.  As a result of the work carried out, annual energy savings worth &euro;2.6 million and 12kt CO<sub>2</sub> where achieved.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="5"><?oasys _ix ?>SEI also ran a &euro;1.3m support programme providing energy assessments and training to local authorities and other public sector agencies.  This has resulted in savings worth between &euro;1.2M and &euro;1.8M in 2009.  A range of best practice guides were also developed and an energy efficiency design process initiated to incorporate energy efficiency principles into the design of new or retrofitted public sector services.  Regulations introduced in December 2009 require all public bodies to include, in its annual reports published after January 1st next year, a statement describing the actions it is taking to improve its energy efficiency, together with an assessment of the energy savings arising from those actions.  SEI is currently finalising the methodology for calculating energy savings across the public sector.</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><?oasys _ix ?>For 2010, a dedicated public sector programme will build on the work of 2009.  The Energy Efficiency in the Public Sector Programme will be the main delivery mechanism for energy efficiency actions by public sector bodies.  In addition to the services provided in 2009, areas to be supported this year include:</P><Col N="114"/>
<P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Developing Energy Service Company (ESC) led models under new the National Retrofit programme, outlined in the Budget</P>
<P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Assisting public sector bodies in the development of 2020 energy efficiency strategies to 2020</P>
<P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Working in partnership with all Departments in relation to energy efficient design and procurement.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Regulations have also been finalised to give effect to the EU Energy Efficiency Directive that include new energy efficient public procurement rules.  These new rules will require public bodies to purchase or lease only plant and equipment across a diverse range of technologies that are listed on SEI&rsquo;s database of highly energy efficient products.  This database has already been developed as part of the Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) Scheme for energy efficient technologies.</P>
        <P>SEI is also required under the regulations with producing general guidelines on energy efficient procurement and these will be progressed in conjunction with the new OPW National Public Procurement Office and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The ACA scheme was expanded in 2009 to take account of additional categories including energy efficient IT infrastructure and electric vehicles.  Companies can now write off the full capital cost of energy efficient equipment in the year of purchase.  The ACA scheme currently covers equipment accounting for at least 60% of the energy used by industry in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In compliance with the 2006 and 2008 Building Regulations, it is also the policy of the Office of Public Works (OPW) to conduct a feasibility study on the utilisation of renewable energy technologies in all new buildings over 1,000m<sup>2</sup> as part of the design process.</P>
       <P>The OPW has already installed a number of biomass boiler systems and Solar Panel systems in both new and existing buildings where it has been shown to be both technically and economically feasible.  OPW will continue to take this approach going forward.</P>
       <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has recently prioritised work through the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Board to establish achievable targets for reductions in primary energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for buildings in all sectors of the economy including public sector buildings, with a view to upgrading the requirements in Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations in 2010.  The work programme currently under way will inform the development of a programme for continuous improvement in Part L requirements in coming years with a view to achieving a Carbon Neutral building standard for buildings other than dwellings, including civic buildings, by 2016.</P>
      <P>SEI&rsquo;s Large Industry Energy Network (LIEN) continues to engage with the largest energy using enterprises (in manufacturing and services) where the 120 member companies collectively spend over &euro;800 million per annum on energy.  Recently published analysis shows that by spending &euro;1.9 million these companies avoided energy costs of &euro;60 million in 2008 alone.</P>
      <P>The National Energy Retrofit Programme, announced on Budget Day, will aim to further reduce energy costs and carbon emissions in homes and business while also creating employment and developing a sustainable market for energy services in Ireland.  The detailed design and specification of the new programme is being finalised by my Department and SEI.  The Programme will be the subject of a public consultation in the near future.  In broad terms the Retrofit Programme will bring together the Home Energy Saving Scheme and the Warmer <Col N="115"/>Homes Scheme as well as the support programme for business and the public sector.  It will also involve the development and promotion of energy services by the energy companies.</P>
       <P>This new Programme has the potential to be the most innovative, ambitious, energy-related initiative ever introduced in Ireland.  It will significantly reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and contribute to meeting the national efficiency targets including the target of 33% set for the public sector.  It will also create significant employment in the energy and construction sectors in support of economic renewal.</P>

	<P>It is accepted that even after the full roll-out of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) there will still be a small percentage of premises that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).  The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  In this context, my Department is currently considering the detailed design and implementation of a scheme which would address the issue of broadband availability to unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.</P>
        <P>It is hoped to commence the scheme this year with the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  State Aid approval has been granted by the European Commission as part of the overall process of securing the necessary approvals and funding for the scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 117, 129, 138 and 527 together.</P>
        <P>The Government has approved the implementation of a national postcode system for Ireland as recommended by the National Postcode Project Board.  For any developed country, a postcode system is a key piece of national infrastructure that can deliver economic and social benefits across the whole economy.  Ireland is the only country in the EU that does not have such a code in place.</P>
        <P>Consultations conducted by the National Postcode Project Board&rsquo;s advisors revealed an overwhelming support for the introduction of postcodes across public, private and voluntary sectors and identified that postcodes would not only deliver benefits for the postal sector but also would contribute to the development of a knowledge economy and the country&rsquo;s overall competitiveness.</P>
        <P>With respect to the postal sector, the forthcoming liberalisation of the market in 2011 has highlighted the absence of a postcode as a potential barrier to market development and many stakeholders see postcodes as playing an important role in development of a competitive, high-quality postal sector.</P>
        <P>However, some of the more significant benefits of having a postcode in place will materialise outside of the postal and logistics sectors.  These benefits include providing an enhanced capacity and capability to use spatial data effectively and link databases with spatial elements across Government.  Using spatial data more effectively can improve public policy making and help with the more effective use of resources.  Postcodes will also facilitate better location-based services and will also facilitate the speedier deployment of emergency services.</P>
        <P>As regards costs, the National Postcodes Project Board&rsquo;s report in 2006 estimated upfront costs of establishing a postcode address database, implementing and promoting the postcode would be in the region of &euro;15m.  This cost is to be met by the Exchequer.  The Board was assisted in its work by technical and economic consultants, recruited and funded in 2005 by ComReg, at a cost of approximately &euro;479,000.</P>
        <P>Following a Government decision in May 2007, consultants were asked to review and quantify the public sector benefits of introducing postcodes.  They estimated the monetary benefits to the State would be &euro;22 million in the medium term.  This analysis incurred fees of &euro;54,450 and in its assessment, incorporated similar costs for the postcodes project as the National Postcodes Project Board.  The ongoing annual maintenance costs will be financed from revenues generated by the postcode manager charging for value added products and services.  The relevant reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.dcenr.ie.</P>
        <P>Postcodes will bring opportunities for many across the whole economy, and while there may also be some costs for businesses in updating large address databases, or for An Post incorporating postcodes into its existing operations, most stakeholders consulted, who were in favour of postcodes, said that they would immediately implement them implying that any costs incurred in updating their databases, would be outweighed by the benefits.</P>
        <P>The National Postcodes Project Board, which was established to recommend the most appropriate postcode system for Ireland, recommended an alpha-numeric, publicly available and accessible postcode model.  Each postcode would have a geo-coordinate at its centre and consequently would be compatible with global positioning or navigation systems and would be adaptable to the emerging technological and legal environment.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to comment specifically an An Post&rsquo;s Geodirectory as a product per se, but it should be noted that the Geodirectory is not a publicly available postcode system and is a commercial, proprietary, address database, thus failing one of the criteria for a public postcode.</P><Col N="117"/>
        <P>My officials and I are now working to address the next steps in the postcodes project, including the process of selection of a body to implement the proposed system which will be done by way of an open, competitive process.  It is expected that postcodes will be assigned and in use during 2011.</P>

	<P>Government policy pertaining to the electronic communications market in Ireland is set out in &ldquo;Next Generation Broadband &mdash; Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland&rdquo;, which I published in June 2009.  The policy paper was developed in accordance with various key principles, which are crucial to the development of the market including (i) competition, at platform and service levels, which drives innovation and investment (ii) investment certainty for service providers considering investing in network infrastructure, (iii) investment intervention by Government to bridge any digital divide in cases of market failure and to meet certain of the State&rsquo;s own communication needs, and (iv) appropriate regulation.  The policy paper sets out the Government&rsquo;s position that investment in broadband infrastructure is primarily a matter for the private sector, facilitated, where appropriate and possible, by Government (e.g. by providing access to State owned infrastructure).</P>
        <P>Existing policy has facilitated significant progress in broadband roll out and broadband speeds over recent years and my focus will be on continuing implementation of this policy.  I welcome all plans by service providers across different platforms to invest in high-speed broadband and will ensure that the State provides a supportive environment for such investment.</P>

	<P>Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is a highly efficient way of generating onsite heat and electricity simultaneously.  It can offer significantly reduced energy bills for the end user and is a particularly efficient form of energy generation as it minimises any transmission losses involved in getting power to the site.</P>
        <P>Traditionally, CHP plants were only used in large industrial units with a high on-site heat load.  Increasingly the technology is developing higher efficiency, smaller scale units that are capable of servicing smaller buildings and even down to individual residential scale units.</P>
        <P>As this technology becomes more common in the market, smaller commercial premises, including public buildings, can now reduce their energy costs by installing CHP systems.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), administers the Deployment Programme for CHP technologies.  The programme was expanded in early 2008 to include dedicated support for Biomass and Anaerobic Digestion powered CHP.</P>
        <P>Under the Deployment Programme, SEI has supported 9 hospitals with a total capacity of 1.7 MWe and 5 educational establishments with a total capacity of 1.36 MWe at a cost of over &euro;650,000.</P>
        <P>The Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat), which incentivises the installation of biomass boilers, is also open to institutional users of heat, and has already supported the construction of a number of projects where the heat load was not sufficient to justify the expense of a CHP plant.</P>
        <P>Taken together, CHP technologies and the projects supported by Reheat offer a real and immediate solution to energy costs in public sector buildings by reducing the cost of power and increasing the overall energy efficiency of the buildings.</P>
        <P>CHP, in conjunction with the other measures in the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, including the Energy Demand Reduction Target Programme (EDRT), will provide a more energy efficient and cheaper generation option for public sector buildings which will help ensure that the overall public sector target of 33% improvement in overall energy efficiency is met.</P>
        <P>The detailed design and specification of the new EDRT programme is being finalised between my Department and SEI.  The programme will be the subject of public consultation in the near future.  In that process the inclusion of CHP, particularly for the commercial and public sector will be considered.</P>

	<P>The current EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which runs until the end of 2012, requires a free allocation of carbon credits to electricity generators.</P><Col N="120"/>
        <P>The North/South Single Electricity Market Committee, which is statutorily responsible for the operation of the all-island electricity market on the island of Ireland, decided that from 2008 all electricity generators must include the full opportunity cost of their carbon allocations when bidding into the Single Electricity Market.</P>
        <P>The enterprise community in particular is concerned that this increases the wholesale cost of electricity and gives rise to windfall gains being earned by electricity generators.  The cost impact of carbon and the related windfall gains for generators, fluctuates with the price of carbon, which is currently at approximately &euro;13 a tonne.</P>
        <P>The Government decided last July to work to progress the introduction of legislation to recover carbon windfall gains from electricity generators up to 2012.</P>
        <P>My Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Finance, is examining the complex issues inherent in designing a legislative mechanism, which could recover carbon windfall gains from electricity generation companies.</P>
        <P>There are many legal and other considerations to take into account in any potential treatment of carbon windfall gains.  I will be reverting to the Government with the outcome of the analysis in the near future.</P>
        <P>I would point out that ESB contributed over &euro;300m in 2009 to reduce electricity prices for all consumers, of which ESB&rsquo;s carbon benefits accounted for a significant portion.</P>
        <P>For the future and in the context of the European Union&rsquo;s ambitious plans for carbon emissions and cap and trade after 2012, it remains my personal view that the allocation of carbon credits, which is the basis for trading, should be done by auction rather than free allocation.  I strongly favour a scenario post 2012 in which all carbon permits should be bought on the open market and producers can compete on the basis of carbon costs.</P>
        <P>This will eliminate any windfall gains for electricity producers and promote competition between generators as to who can produce electricity using the least carbon.  In my view this is an essential development, which will be good for the environment and good for the consumer.</P>

The broadband market is a fast moving and dynamic one; this applies to all OECD countries.  On this basis annual comparisons of broadband metrics between different countries cannot capture the full extent of market developments.  For example, the OECD report is a snapshot of the position as at June 2009 and excludes improved penetration achieved using mobile technologies in calculating the ratings. Ireland has over 400,000 mobile broadband subscribers, an increase of 53.3% over the last year.  Mobile broadband is widely used in countries with large, widely dispersed, rural populations like Ireland.  If mobile broadband was included Ireland&rsquo;s position in the OECD table would be significantly better.  It is noteworthy that Ireland continued to be one of the leading countries in terms of year on year broadband growth in the OECD, adding 2.68 subscribers (per 100 of population) while the OECD average stood at <Col N="121"/>1.72 subscribers.  Ireland&rsquo;s broadband penetration increased to 30.5% in Q3/2009 (with mobile included) as compared with 25.9% in Q3 2008.</P>
        <P>As regards other international comparator reports, ComReg, in its latest Quarterly Report, highlighted Ireland, when compared with the EU27, had a fixed broadband penetration of 21.2% and a mobile broadband penetration rate of 8.3% as of Q2&rsquo;09. Ireland&rsquo;s fixed penetration rate is below the EU27 average of 23.9% but Ireland&rsquo;s mobile broadband penetration rate is well above the EU27 average of 4.2%.  If fixed and mobile broadband penetration rates are combined, Ireland ranks 11th out of the EU27 countries (note: no mobile broadband figure was represented for Finland); 14th among fixed broadband penetration rates only and 4th among mobile broadband penetration rates only.</P>

	<P>I welcome the fact that the benefits of competition in electricity supply, which have previously been confined to large industrial and commercial customers, are also now available to domestic consumers.  The entry into the domestic electricity market of two new suppliers, Airtricity and Bord G&aacute;is Energy, demonstrates that policy to encourage competition in electricity generation and supply is paying dividends for consumers.</P>
        <P>The independent suppliers are offering discounts of between 10% and 14% on ESB unit rates which are still regulated.  They are also offering domestic consumers alternative billing arrangements and options for the level of renewable electricity they purchase.</P>
        <P>Energy price regulation is designed to ensure that a dominant player cannot engage in uncompetitive, short-term pricing practices, which could undermine or drive out emerging competition.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has made it clear that the regulation of ESB tariffs will discontinue when competition has taken firm hold in the market.</P>
        <P>The CER is now working with ESB and with the other players in the market to develop a timeframe for deregulation of the regulated ESB tariffs in line with the emergence of competition of scale.  On 2nd December last, the CER published its paper for consultation on the timing and conditions under which regulation of prices should be removed from ESB Customer Supply.  The CER is also consulting on other actions to be taken, apart from the removal of the price control, in order to ensure a fully competitive deregulated electricity retail market.  The closing date for submissions to this consultation paper is February 1st 2010.  A clear roadmap for retail electricity deregulation will then emerge from this process.</P>

	<P>At the Energy Council in Brussels on 7 December, I signed the political declaration on the North Seas Countries Offshore Grid Initiative.  This important initiative will spearhead the development of an offshore wind energy grid, or &lsquo;supergrid&rsquo;, in the North and North West Seas.</P>
        <P>The North Seas Initiative involves Ireland, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxemburg, The Netherlands, Sweden and the UK in recognition that the major part of offshore wind energy development in Europe will be focussed on the North and North West seas including the Irish Sea and the Western Seaboard.  The development of offshore wind energy infrastructure in North West Europe will deliver enhanced security of supply, greater competition and a more integrated European energy Market, as well as critically underpinning Europe&rsquo;s climate change and renewable energy targets.</P>
        <P>Ireland is recognised as having very significant potential for the development of offshore renewable energy including the prospect of becoming an exporter of electricity to Europe.  It is therefore essential that Ireland is at the heart of all European renewable energy developments.</P>
        <P>The North Seas Initiative is a welcome step forward in delivering on the European vision and ambition in renewable energy policy.  The cost of developing the electricity infrastructure and technical, market, regulatory and community acceptance issues are shared challenges for all the countries concerned.</P>
        <P>A shared vision on offshore grid development for North West Europe is essential in order to deliver the best and most sustainable solutions.  The initiative will also work to achieve compatible political and regulatory regimes for long term offshore infrastructure development in the region.</P>
        <P>The North Seas Initiative will take into account the work being done under existing initiatives.  This explicitly includes the Irish-Scottish Links on Energy Study (The ISLES project). This is a joint project between Ireland, Scotland and Northern Ireland and is supported by the EU INTERREG programme.  The project is examining the feasibility of the construction of an <Col N="123"/>offshore electricity transmission network linking potential offshore sites for the generation of renewable energy in the coastal waters of Ireland, Northern Ireland and western Scotland.</P>

        <P>There are other fora in the EU which are addressing the various challenges inherent in developing offshore wind including the Adamowitsch Group and the European Transmission System Operators Group.  Ireland actively participates in both of these groups.  We will also be working more directly with the UK Government under the work programme of the British Irish Council on the development of our common grid infrastructure.</P>
        <P>I also intend setting out our own offshore and grid development plans within the renewable energy action plan which is due to be presented to the EU Commission this summer.</P>

	<P>The transportation and supply of domestic gas cylinders which contain liquid petroleum gas (LPG) is not licensed under the Energy Acts and neither my Department nor the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has any role in the regulation of LPG transportation or supply.</P>
        <P>While the regulation of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann natural gas tariffs is the responsibility of the CER, which is statutorily independent in the performance of its functions, the Commission has no function in regard to the setting of the retail price of LPG, which is a by-product of oil.  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  Accordingly, there is no price control on petroleum products in Ireland and my Department does not have details of retail prices charged in respect of LPG.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to mitigating energy costs for vulnerable households through a combination of institutional supports, investment in improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock and the wide availability of advice.</P>
        <P>I am working closely with the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Environment, Heritage and Local Government to continue to deliver a fully cohesive Government response to the challenges of addressing energy affordability in Ireland in line with the commitment in the Renewed Programme for Government.  The Energy Affordability Strategy is being prepared under the auspices of the Interdepartmental/Agency Group and will be subject of public consultation in the near future. It will set out existing strategies and measures and future approaches to addressing energy affordability in a cohesive way.</P>
        <P>There are three methods of calculating the extent of fuel poverty: the expenditure method or share of income spent on household fuels; subjective measures on the part of occupants; and objective measurement of residence condition and comfort levels in relation to needs.</P><Col N="124"/>

        <P>ESRI estimates that using the expenditure method, 301,368 or 19.4% of Irish households may have experienced fuel poverty in 2008.  Alternatively, using the subjective method 54,372 or 3.7% of households reported that they could not afford to heat their homes adequately in 2008.  Enhancing the energy efficiency of homes through structural improvements is pivotal to the Government&rsquo;s strategy to address energy affordability.</P>
        <P>To date, energy efficiency improvements in nearly 40,000 homes have been made under the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), of which 5,343 homes were completed in 2008 and 19,000 in 2009 (including nearly 3,000 homes delivered by the ESB according to WHS specification).  Some &euro;15 million was provided for the scheme in 2009, with a further &euro;5 million provided by ESB and BGE. Of the &euro;15 million Exchequer allocation &euro;12.4m was spent under the scheme last year.  Funding of &euro;13m has been provided to the scheme in 2010.  Fuel poverty vulnerable homes will also be supported under the National Energy Retrofit Programme which will be launched later this year.</P>
        <P>The WHS provides energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, fuel poverty and is primarily delivered by community based organisations (CBOs) of which 22 have, to date, been approved to provide this service.  The CBOs work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations including public health nurses, MABS and St. Vincent De Paul to identify and address vulnerable homes.  Private contractors were also engaged in 2009 to address the increasing demand for the scheme.</P>

	<P>The green economy is set to make a very significant contribution to economic renewal by creating employment in areas such as renewable energy and energy efficiency.  The report of the Green Enterprise Group, published in December 2009, indicated that there is potential to create over 80,000 jobs in the green economy over the coming years.  At the launch of the Report, I noted that over 15,000 jobs had already been announced during the year for creation in the green economy sector.  These jobs are on foot of specific announcements of re-investment in green economy jobs by the private sector and the Energy State Companies as well as an estimate of the employment spin-off impact of energy efficiency measures which have been put in place.</P>

	<P>The Ocean Energy Development Unit (OEDU) was established in Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) in 2008 and full implementation of the Ocean Energy programme commenced in 2009. Government has set an ambitious target of 500MW of ocean energy by 2020.</P>
        <P>Ocean energy is currently at the research and development stage globally.  There is no ocean energy device as yet connected to the Irish grid.  SEI is working in conjunction with ESBI, the Marine Institute and other stakeholders to establish a grid connected ocean energy test facility off Annagh Head County Mayo.  The test site will be a key enabler for the development of an ocean energy industry in Ireland.  An exploratory foreshore licence was granted to SEI in September 2009, which has enabled site investigation works to commence at the planned test site location.  Progressing the test site is a key priority for 2010 in order to ensure that Ireland is demonstrably a competitive player in the European ocean energy arena.</P>
        <P>SEI, under the Ocean Energy Prototype Development Fund, has approved funding support totalling &euro;4.35m for 12 projects from over 30 expressions of interest received.  The funding support is designed to stimulate the commercial development and deployment of ocean energy devices that can generate renewable electricity.  Additional projects are being assessed at present.</P>
        <P>The Ocean Energy Package announced in 2008 provided funding of &euro;26m over three years.  &euro;7m was allocated to the Ocean Energy Programme for 2009 of which &euro;3.764m was spent, reflecting the fact that work to progress the test site was at a very preliminary stage during 2009 and the approved prototype funding support is being disbursed over the two years 2009 and 2010.  &euro;7.8m has been allocated to the Ocean Energy Programme for 2010 and it is expected that this funding will be fully expended.</P>

	<P>I have consistently encouraged a debate on nuclear power in Ireland as I believe that informed debate is fundamental to ensuring informed policy making.</P>
        <P>For my own part, I have stated firmly that I do not see nuclear power as the answer to Ireland&rsquo;s energy needs.  Ireland&rsquo;s position on nuclear energy is shared by several EU Member States. Article 194 of the Lisbon Treaty affirms the right of Member States to determine their choice of energy resources.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s comparative advantage in renewable electricity resources should see such power supplies rather than nuclear developing over the next decade.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) is responsible for developing and maintaining comprehensive national and sectoral statistics for energy production, transformation and end-use.</P>
        <P>The latest available statistics on energy consumption and fuel mix relate to 2008; statistics for 2009 will be published later this year.  SEI&rsquo;s publication &ldquo;Energy in Ireland 1990 to 2008&rdquo;, <Col N="126"/>which is available on SEI&rsquo;s website, states that energy imports accounted for 89% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2008.  SEI has advised that imported electricity accounted for 0.4% of these energy imports.</P>
        <P>Ireland imports electricity from Northern Ireland, which is in turn linked to the UK electricity market via the Moyle Interconnector.  While nuclear generation forms a part of the overall UK generation fuel mix, I am advised that it is not technically possible to distinguish the flow of electricity across interconnectors by reference to the original source of supply or generation.</P>

	<P>Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act, 2009 provides for, amongst other things, the closure of the national analogue TV network.</P>
        <P>My stated policy objective on this is that the earliest possible switch-off of the analogue system needs to be achieved thereby releasing valuable spectrum to enable Ireland to reap the benefits of the digital dividend.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set 2012 as the timeline for analogue switch off throughout Europe and has recommended that Member States should endeavour to adopt 1 January 2012 as the target date.  The EU Council of Ministers, for its part, has asked member States to, as far as possible, complete the switchover in 2012.</P>
        <P>I consider that it is in the best interests of Ireland that the precise switch off date for analogue services should be identified as soon as possible and, as stated above, my objective is that this should take place no later than quarter 4 of 2012.  It is also important that there is certainty provided in relation to when free-to-air digital terrestrial television (DTT) will be available.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I have established a group to advise me on planning for analogue switch off and related matters.  The Group includes representatives of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), ComReg, RT&Eacute; and my own Department.  I expect to be presented with the group&rsquo;s recommendations within the coming weeks and when I have considered them I will announce the precise dates for both the availability of free-to-air DTT and analogue switch off.</P>

It is not possible to anticipate the number of licences that will be granted this year, which will be a function of current and future applications in 2010 that applicants pursue to finality.  The Deputy will note that 66 applications were granted in 2009 and 11 have been granted to date in 2010.  All mineral prospecting licences are activated when granted.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
        <Quest> the number of tribunals of inquiry conducted by his Department; the title of each; the cost of each to date in 2010; the expected date of conclusion of each; and the projected final costs. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it that the Deputy&rsquo;s question concerns Tribunals for the payment of whose costs my Department has responsibility.  </P>
        <P>In that context, my Department&rsquo;s responsibility relates only to the Tribunal of Inquiry into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters, known as the Moriarty Tribunal.  This was established in September 1997 on foot of resolutions of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The cost of the Tribunal up to 31 December 2009 (the latest date for which figures are available) was &euro;38.27m.</P><Col N="132"/>
        <P>This figure does not include third-party costs.  The Sole Member of the Tribunal, Mr Justice Moriarty, has not yet addressed such costs.</P>
        <P>The Tribunal secretariat has on many occasions over the years responded to my Department&rsquo;s enquiries in the matter to the effect that any attempt to quantify such costs would lead to conclusions being drawn and suppositions made which could infringe the rights of witnesses and impinge on the independence of the Tribunal.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s 2008 Special Report on Tribunals of Inquiry estimates a range of figures for such costs but stresses that they are subject to many caveats and contingencies.</P>
        <P>As regards the date for completion of the Tribunal&rsquo;s work, the Tribunal has already published the first part of its Report.  The Sole Member has recently informed me that, short of some situation that falls utterly out of his hands, he will make it his business to ensure that preparation for printing of the second, final, part of the Report will be completed by mid-February.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 and 157 together.</P>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Development Office (NESDO) is the only agency currently under the aegis of my Department.  It is an umbrella body for i) the National Economic and Social Council (NESC), ii) the National Economic and Social Forum (NESF), and iii) the National Centre for Partnership and Performance (NCPP).  NESDO and its constituent bodies (the NESC, NESF and NCPP), have played an important role in the development of national policy and through support for the social partnership process.  However, the profoundly changed national and international context which has emerged in the past eighteen months has thrown up challenges that must shape the role of the NESDO and its constituent bodies in the coming years.</P>
        <P>In order to maximise both effectiveness and value for money, the Government has decided to streamline the work of policy advice within the NESDO by amalgamating the three constituent bodies through absorbing the NESF and NCPP into the NESC.  In consequence of this, the NESF and the NCPP will be dissolved with effect from a date to be specified in an order which will be made shortly under the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006.</P>
        <P>With these changes in mind the budget for NESDO in 2010 was reduced by 24% to &euro;3,854,000 with potential for further administrative savings once the restructuring is implemented.  The number of staff employed in NESDO and its constituent bodies in 2007 and 2008 was 23.8 whole-time equivalents (wte), while in 2009, 20.8 wte&rsquo;s were employed.  Some further reductions in staff numbers are anticipated following implementation of the changes.</P><Col N="133"/>
        <P>The work of the Ireland Newfoundland Partnership was subsumed into my Department in 2009.  An amount of &euro;300,000 was provided for the Partnership in the 2009 Estimates. It is expected that the cost of running the Partnership this year will be approximately &euro;40,000.</P>
        <P>The National Forum on Europe was closed in 2009.  The Forum was an independent body, with its funding provided through my Department&rsquo;s vote.  At the time of its closure, the Government indicated that it expected that the Oireachtas would resume the role of primary forum for national debate of issues related to Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the EU, pointing to the work of the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in Europe by way of example.</P>

	<P>Labour Court Recommendation 18921 recommended that Job Initiative Team Leaders should receive the appropriate Benchmarking payments under similar terms as applied to the Community Employment Supervisors.  A validation process was then undertaken to pay <Col N="141"/>Phases 3 and 4 of the Towards 2016 pay agreement to Job Initiative Team Leaders. This was essentially the same validation process used to award Community Employment Supervisors their Towards 2016 Phases 3 &amp; 4 increases.  It encompassed cooperation with the principles concerning Public Service modernisation and flexibility; industrial relations stability; cooperation with the roll-out of the F&Aacute;S Community Services Management (CSM); implementation of Quality Assurance policies and procedures; and cooperation with ongoing operational and technological change on Schemes.</P>

	<P>I indicated in my earlier reply that I would revert to you with the relevant information at a later date.  I now set out my reply below.</P>
        <P>Between 1997 and 2008 management staff increased by 70% from 170 to 291.  Assistant Managers comprised 75% of this increase.</P>
        <P>The rise in management staff within F&Aacute;S was caused by a number of factors. This included a complete revision of F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s organisational structure within each of the regions in order to achieve a better focus of staff resources on key customer groups.  This resulted in the creation of 37 Assistant Manager posts based across the regions.  It also included the integration in 2000 of responsibilities formerly carried out by the National Rehabilitation Board, which resulted in the transfer of 63 staff into F&Aacute;S including a number of managerial posts.  The overall increase is also attributable to the significant rise in the output of F&Aacute;S training services activity as a direct result of the large increase in Apprenticeships over the period.</P>
        <P>I would emphasise to the Deputy that as at the end of 2009 management grades in F&Aacute;S had decreased by 11% overall (32 posts) and by 16% (6 posts in grades 1-4) in the senior management group from its peak in 2008.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>A lay off situation arises where an employee&rsquo;s employment ceases by reason of his/her employer being unable to provide the work for which the employee was employed and where it is reasonable in the circumstances for that employer to believe that the cessation of employment will not be permanent.  The employer must however give notice to that effect to the employee prior to the cessation. If the lay-off continues, the question arises as to whether it is in fact a temporary measure or could potentially be a redundancy rather than a lay-off situation.</P>
        <P>Assuming an entitlement to redundancy exists in line with the eligibility criteria set down in Redundancy legislation, the employee can by law, serve written notice (Form RP 9) on the employer, claiming redundancy because of the lay-off situation.  Notice must be submitted not later than four weeks after the lay-off ceases.  A copy of the RP 9 form may be had from my Department or may be downloaded from the Department&rsquo;s website at www.entemp.ie.</P>
        <P>There is no statutory maximum period for lay off situations as this could unnecessarily interfere with the need for flexibility in a lay-off situation which can, in reality, extend for some time or indeed for different protracted periods of time. However, the Redundancy Payments Acts provides a necessary safeguard in that, where an employee has been laid off<b> </b>for four consecutive weeks, or for a series of six or more weeks<b> </b>(of which not more than three were consecutive) within a 13-week<b> </b>period, the employee may file a notice claiming redundancy.</P>
        <P>Provided that the employer does not counter claim by offering 13 weeks continual employment, starting within four weeks of the date of receipt of the notice and notified to the employee within seven days of receipt of the notice, the employee may be entitled to claim redundancy.</P>
        <P>Payment of statutory redundancy is, in the first instance, a matter for the employer and it is the employer who initially decides whether or not there is a redundancy situation.  In the case of a dispute regarding entitlements under the Redundancy Payments Acts, the matter may be referred for adjudication by the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT).</P>
        <P>It is important to note that an employee must make application for a redundancy payment or seek a determination from the EAT within twelve months of ceasing his employment. The 12 month deadline applies both to the making of a claim to the employer and to the making of a claim to the EAT in a situation where the employer disputes payment of redundancy.</P>

        <Quest> the safeguards which are in place to ensure that companies do not cease trading in order that staff receive statutory redundancy payments from her Department while continuing to operate under a new name. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2007, the objective is to ensure that statutory redundancy payments, due to eligible employees on being made redundant, are made in accordance with the legislative provisions.  The legislation places the onus, in the first instance, on the employer to discharge the obligation to pay redundancy entitlement to employees.  On so doing, the employer is entitled, by virtue of the pay related social contributions made to the State, to recover 60% of the lump sum redundancy payments paid out to employees.</P>
        <P>In the case of liquidations/receiverships, the Department acts in locus of the employer and pays the redundancy lump sums directly to the employees and then seeks to recover from the <Col N="149"/>appointed liquidator/receiver the 40% which the employer would have been due to pay to the employees.</P>
        <P>In instances where the employer does not formally wind the company up but goes into informal insolvency and is unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Department seeks from the employer evidence of inability to pay the entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company&rsquo;s Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.  If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share which the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.  In this instance, the Minister becomes a preferential creditor in a winding-up situation in recovering amounts paid from the Social Insurance Fund and this debt stands against a company for as long as it is live on the Companies Register at the Company Registration Office.</P>
        <P>Of course it is the case that company failures are a normal facet of business life and it would be unduly penal if, due to a company failure, all the directors and officers of that company were to forever more be prevented from setting up again.  That is, provided it is clear that their actions resulted from genuine business failure as opposed to acts of recklessness or inappropriate behaviour.</P>
        <P>Under Company law, there are provisions dealing with companies who fail and re-engage in trading under a new name in particular, under the provisions of Part V of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.  Under section 56 of the Act, Liquidators of insolvent companies are required to submit a report to the Director of Corporate Enforcement within 6 months of their appointment.  This report outlines the circumstances of the insolvency and addresses whether the directors acted honestly and responsibly in relation to the conduct of the company&rsquo;s affairs.  Liquidators are further obliged to bring High Court proceedings for the restriction of such directors unless relieved of that obligation by the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <P>A restriction declaration, if made, prohibits an individual from acting, either directly or indirectly, as an officer of a company or from being involved in its formation or promotion for five years, unless the company is adequately capitalised.</P>
        <P>The Director of Corporate Enforcement has the power to bring any other prosecution for breaches of the Companies Acts as deemed appropriate in any individual case.  If the Deputy is aware of any activities in which the Director may have an interest, I would encourage him to have that information forwarded to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>

Capital funding which is allocated to my Department is expended through various agencies under the remit of the Department, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, F&Aacute;S, <Col N="150"/>Shannon Development, Inter<i>Trade</i>Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland and the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards.</P>
        <P>Most of the funding is used by the agencies to provide a range of grants and supports to clients.  However, some degree of tendering may take place in relation to specific projects, such as the maintenance of premises and the upgrading of equipment.</P>
        <P>My Department does not hold details of tendering processes operated by the agencies.  However, I will ask the agencies to respond directly to the Deputy with the information requested.</P>

        <Quest> if she will provide a detailed breakdown of the &euro;2,327,000 expended in 2009 under the heading of Miscellaneous Payments, X2; if she will provide a breakdown of the &euro;2,549,000 provided for same in the Book of Estimates 2010; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Estimates for my Department which were published on 9 December 2009 in parallel with the 2010 Budget included an estimate for Subhead X2 (Miscellaneous Payments) of &euro;2.327 million for 2009 and &euro;2.549 million for 2010.</P>
        <P>The Miscellaneous Payments subhead primarily makes provision for legal costs which might be expected to arise in the course of the work of my Department and its Offices.  These costs might arise, for example, from actions taken against the Department or its Offices.</P>
        <P>Provision has also been made in the subhead for legal costs in respect of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  While the Board funds its operational costs through fees charged in the <Col N="153"/>course of its activities, I have been advised by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, does not allow such fees to be used to cover non-operational legal costs, such as those arising from general legal challenges to the operation of the PIAB.  While this advice related to a specific case, it is nonetheless prudent to provide for such costs to be borne by my Department.</P>
        <P>The 2009 estimate for Subhead X2 of my Department&rsquo;s Vote included &euro;650,000 to meet potential legal costs arising during 2009 in relation to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  Approximately &euro;622,000 of this provision was spent.  A provision of &euro;581,000 is included in the 2010 Estimate for Subhead X2 in respect of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board&rsquo;s potential legal costs.</P>
        <P>Apart from some other very minor provisions, the subhead includes a contingency sum, as required in accordance with standing instructions from the Department of Finance, to cater for unforeseen items which might emerge in the course of the year.  A sum of &euro;656,000 was provided for contingencies in 2009.  The corresponding sum for 2010 is &euro;588,000.</P>

	<P>The Estimates for my Department which were published on 9 December 2009 in parallel with the 2010 Budget reflected an estimate of &euro;87.310 million in Appropriations-in-Aid for 2009 and an estimate of &euro;95.902 million in Appropriations-in-Aid for 2010.</P>
        <P>The breakdown of the 2009 figure was published in the 2009 Revised Estimates Volume.  The breakdown of the 2010 figure will be published in the 2010 Revised Estimate Volume in February.  In summary, the main sources of funding under this heading relate to receipts from the European Social Fund, Employment Permit fees, monies received by the Companies Registration Office, the Patents Office, the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority in the course of their operations, superannuation contributions from certain agencies, contributions from the Pension Related Deduction for public servants, and other miscellaneous receipts.</P>
        <P>Appropriations-in-Aid realised in 2009 were lower than forecast, at approximately &euro;73 million.  This shortfall was due to the non-receipt of monies from the European Social Fund which are now expected to be received in 2010.  The forecast of Appropriations-in-Aid for 2010 published on 9 December 2009 was provisional and will be reviewed in the context of the 2010 Revised Estimates Volume.</P>

	<P>A consequence of the corporate right to sue and be sued is that a company cannot appear in court except through its solicitor or counsel, (unless of course, it is being sued on indictment when it may appear in court by a representative appointed by the company). In Battle v Irish Art Promotion Centre Ltd [1968] IR252, the Supreme Court refused such an application on <Col N="154"/>the basis that the company was a different person, separate and distinct from its controlling shareholder. Given that the Supreme Court decision in the Battle&rsquo;s case is settled law here for some time, I am reluctant to undertake any review of the matter in the absence of some compelling grounds or demonstrated need for doing so.</P>

	<P>The Company Law Review Group [CLRG] made recommendations which have been accepted by Government, to reform the substantive and procedural requirements of the winding-up regime including liquidations. The recommendations were published as Part A11 of the General Scheme of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill which is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
        <P>With the exception of non court procedures such as (i) members voluntary winding-up; (ii) creditors voluntary winding-up; and, (iii) dissolution after a fixed period of time, the role of the court in liquidations is to ensure fairness to the companies members and creditors and it is not clear how an alternative could perform this role with the same legal certainty which attaches to the decisions of a court.</P>
        <P>Part A12 of the General Scheme provides for Strike-Off and Restoration by a court and by administrative procedure; however only a court may permit the restoration of a company to the register following liquidation.</P>

        <P>Additionally, restaurants in Kildare that are located within Hotels are inspected as part of the general inspections undertaken under the Hotels Employment Regulation Order.  While it is not possible to separately identify the restaurant and non-restaurant elements of such inspections, it may be taken that the number of Hotel inspections represents a good approximation of the number of inspections of Hotel restaurants.  In 2009, 5 hotels in Kildare were inspected whereas in 2008, 6 were inspected.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might also be interested to know that at my request, NERA has undertaken significant work, in conjunction with the NERA Advisory Board on the development of a code of practice for use by NERA staff, including Inspectors.  I expect that the code will be finalized shortly and will be published on NERA&rsquo;s website.  It will govern the operational manner in which NERA staff conduct compliance work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 5 August 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  This claim awaits processing.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from July 2009.</P>
        <P>Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for 2009 of 77,001. This figure exceeds the claims lodged for 2008 (40,607) by 90% and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 52.5;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The T&aacute;naiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and  we are currently looking at ways in which additional resources can be allocated to the area in the first quarter of 2010.</P>

	<P>The Work Placement Programme provides up to 9 months work experience for 2,000 unemployed individuals.  The fact that a person is participating in the Programme does not in itself affect their social welfare entitlements.</P>
        <P>Participants on the Live Register must be in receipt of social welfare payments for 3 months if they wish to retain these payments as this gives them the opportunity to pursue employment or further education and training opportunities, prior to seeking the work placement. There is <Col N="158"/>considerable churn on the Live Register and in the last 12-month period 498,229 people left the Live Register with 159,390 of these gaining employment. Given that a large proportion of people leave the Live Register in the first few months, the removal of the Work Placement Programme&rsquo;s 3-month criteria could result in less people leaving the Live Register to take up paid employment.</P>
        <P>The Programme offers work experience and does not involve paid employment so there is no obligation for the provider to pay social insurance contributions for the person placed with them.</P>
        <P>There are no restrictions on the provider of places if they so wish to provide travel and subsistence support. However, if a provider decides to pay travel and subsistence to a person placed with them, this could be deemed to be more and could affect that participant&rsquo;s social welfare entitlements.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs would need to be informed of such payments to participants. Further, these payments might require approval of the Revenue Commission from a taxation perspective.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that because of the recent flooding, there are people who may have difficulties renewing flood insurance cover.  The principal reason for this is that the decision to provide any specific form of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter based on the assessment an insurer will make of the risks involved.  This risk assessment process which insurance companies apply is essential if a company is to be able to provide its services over the longer term and continue to remain solvent.  Unfortunately, this means on occasions they have difficulty approving certain types of business because the risk of claims based on previous experience is too high.  Neither I nor the Financial Regulator has any influence over such decisions due to their commercial nature.</P>
        <P>The question of introducing legislation to make the provision of flood insurance mandatory and to preclude companies from choosing what they can cover is not something I am contemplating at this point, as it would run the risk of undermining the existing insurance model and could force many companies out of the market.  Even if companies remained within the market they would almost certainly price high risk business in such a prohibitively expensive fashion, that it would quickly undermine the purpose of the legislation and would result in a considerable increase in overall household and business insurance costs.</P>
        <P>The question as to whether household and business insurance costs are likely to increase for those not affected by the flooding is a matter for the insurance industry to decide.  However, in broad terms insurance prices generally increase when there is an increase in overall claims to enable companies maintain the appropriate level of financial reserves necessary to continue in business over the longer term.  Without such reserves insurance companies would struggle to meet future claims resulting from another major weather event.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Government is committed to looking at what can be done for those who are unable to obtain insurance cover as part of its broader review of the recent floods.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that repairs and maintenance of property for the elderly are not exempt from VAT.  In certain circumstances, refunds of VAT can be claimed for work which is carried out to provide an aid to assist a disabled person.  This would include for example the construction of specially adapted toilets or shower units.</P>
        <P>In the case referred to the work in question appears to relate to routine rewiring of a house and this would not qualify for a refund of VAT.  If the taxpayer has further queries in this regard, she can contact the Revenue Commissioners, Central Repayments Office in Monaghan, who will be happy to explain the conditions of refund to her.  Their telephone number is 047 62100.</P>

	<P>Following the severe flooding which affected the town in Bandon, Co. Cork in November 2009, the Office of Public Works received a scoping report and an application from Cork County Council for the implementation of a flood relief scheme for the town.  Following its examination of the report, OPW has decided to appoint consultants to identify the most cost effective option for a flood relief scheme, to which OPW has committed itself in principle, as I announced on a visit to Bandon on Friday, 15 January.</P>
        <P>When the consultant&rsquo;s report is to hand, OPW, in conjunction with Cork County Council, will decide the best way to address the issues raised.  Major flood relief schemes involve complex engineering design of options, environmental impact and cost-benefit assessments and construction operations, and invariably have significant lead-in times.  It is too early to predict at this stage when works on such a scheme might be ready to commence.</P>

	<P>The income levy is payable on gross income from all sources before any tax reliefs, capital allowances, losses or pension contributions.  However, there are a number of exemptions from the income levy.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The reason these arrangements have been applied is to make the income levy as fair as possible by providing exemptions for those on very low incomes or with an entitlement to a medical card and by providing increased exemption thresholds for those age 65 and over.  The income levy is highly progressive and has been designed to ensure that those who can afford to pay, pay the most.</P>

	<P>Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council produced the final report of the Dublin Coastal Flooding Protection Project in 2005.  Funding for the study was provided by the Office of Public Works.  The study was undertaken, by the Councils, in direct response to the extreme tide and flood event experienced across Dublin City and Fingal County during February, 2002 and was primarily aimed at addressing the risk from tidal flooding along the coastline and within the tidal reaches of a number of rivers and canals.</P>
        <P>The report contained recommendations in relation to the area referred to by the Deputy and Fingal County Council subsequently applied to OPW in late 2009 for funding to progress the proposal for a sea wall there under the Coastal Protection Programme.  The application, at &euro;2.6M, did not qualify for the 2009 Programme as minor works, but will be considered for funding as part of a proposed Major Works Programme.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been no change in their practice in relation to determining the tax status (i.e. employed vs. self-employed) of locums working as substitutes in general practitioner practices.  The position is that, notwithstanding that an individual may, in relation to an engagement, be described, correctly or otherwise, as a &lsquo;locum&rsquo;, Revenue&rsquo;s approach is to examine all of the facts and circumstances of each case having regard to the <i>Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-employment Status of Individuals</i> and having regard to relevant case law on the subject of contract of service (employed) and contract for service (self-employed).</P>
        <P>In relation to medical doctors working as substitutes in GP practices, a recent Appeal Commissioners decision that certain locum doctors were found to be employees attracted some media attention and generated an increased number of queries to Revenue offices.  As a result of this, Revenue gave renewed publicity to their long held position on the tax treatment of locums engaged in the fields of medicine, health care and pharmacy, which is now set out in Issue 82 of Revenue&rsquo;s publication <i>Tax Briefing, </i>dated 16 December 2009 &mdash; available on www.revenue.ie.</P>
        <P>The fact that an individual is engaged on a whole-time basis or otherwise will generally not be the determining factor in coming to a decision as to the status of that individual.  Depending on the facts and circumstances of a case, an individual may be a full-time employee, a part-time employee, a temporary employee, a casual employee or, indeed, may be self-employed.  The fact that an individual may not have continual work or may not have a whole-time post does not, of itself, make such individual a self-employed contractor.</P>
        <P>Revenue is not in a position to predict the amount of increased revenue (tax, PRSI, etc.) that may arise from the identification of cases of misclassification (self-employed instead of employee) of locums in medical practice.  However, Revenue will continue, in conjunction with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the National Employment Rights Authority (where appropriate), to focus on tax risks in this area of misclassification &mdash; across a multiplicity of sectors &mdash; for the foreseeable future.  An &ldquo;impact assessment&rdquo;, in relation to the compliance costs involved as a result of this ongoing work by Revenue to ensure proper classification, has not been carried out.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249, 302 and 337 together.</P>
        <P>I have always accepted the consensus view of the relevant expert bodies that the introduction of a universal high uptake vaccination programme in young girls, in conjunction with population based cervical screening, could significantly reduce overall cervical cancer incidence.  The issue was not, therefore, whether the case for a cervical cancer vaccination programme was accepted by myself and the Government &mdash; because it always was &mdash; but how to place such a programme in order of clinical priorities for the allocation of scarce resources available for public health services and for the cancer programme in particular.  Recently I requested the HSE to initiate a tendering process for the procurement of a HPV vaccine with a view to commencing a HPV <Col N="170"/>vaccination programme for all girls in first year in secondary school and until this process was completed I was not in a position to say if or when I would introduce this programme.  This tendering process for the vaccine is now complete.  We can now purchase the vaccine at a price much lower than we expected to pay in 2008 and at a price much closer to what is being paid in other countries.  In these circumstances, the programme can now be delivered from the extra resources committed in this year&rsquo;s budget to the overall Cancer Programme.  The HSE is committed to starting this campaign during the current school year.  This will involve the free vaccination of up to 30,000 girls mainly in school settings and an announcement of the details of the full programme involved will be made by the HSE in the near future.  The programme will continue with vaccine being offered to all girls in first year in secondary school each year but it is not proposed to extend the vaccination programme to other classes at present.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately it will not be possible to refund the costs of vaccinations administered privately.</P>

	<P>The scheduling of out-patient appointments is in each case determined on the basis of clinical need.  Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that his or her condition warrants an earlier appointment, the GP may take the matter up with the consultant involved.  The NTPF&rsquo;s primary remit is to facilitate patients who have been waiting longest for surgery on hospital in-patient waiting lists.  Patients are placed on in-patient waiting lists when they have seen a consultant at an out-patient clinic and surgery is recommended.</P>
        <P>The NTPF has conducted a number of out-patient initiatives on a pilot basis.  In selected specialties, a defined number of patients, usually those waiting longest in the specialty, have been offered out-patient consultations in private hospitals and where surgery was required, this <Col N="171"/>was also provided.  The NTPF will be considering, in the context of the preparation of its 2010 service plan, the extent to which it continues to facilitate such arrangements.</P>

      </Qst><Col N="172"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the change in medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 and over in the Health Act 2008, the Health Service Executive (HSE) through its Service Plan for 2009, advised the Department of plans to introduce a centralised national processing centre for medical cards and community drugs schemes as part of the Executive&rsquo;s Value For Money Programme.</P>
        <P>The HSE has indicated that its decision to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals to the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin was in the context of the Executive&rsquo;s requirements to make efficiencies in business practices that could realise savings in a very challenging economic environment and provide a modern service to the public within sustainable levels of expenditure.</P>
        <P>I fully support the HSE&rsquo;s decision to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals at the PCRS as the Executive has advised that when fully implemented, the initiative will ensure:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Improved turnaround times for processing of applications: under the new arrangements the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 working days or less, with provision for emergency applications to be dealt with immediately;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Consistent and equitable application of eligibility and service provision;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Clearer governance and accountability, as well as improved management information; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A reduction in the overall number of staff required to process medical/GP visit card applications, thus freeing up staff for other service needs.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The centralising process is facilitating a number of enhancements to the level of customer service associated with these applications. The HSE has recently launched a facility &mdash; www.medicalcard.ie &mdash; where a person who has applied through the PCRS can view the status of their medical/GP visit card application or review on-line, using a unique reference number that is provided on the acknowledgement sent to them.  If a mobile telephone number is supplied with the application/review, an acknowledgement of receipt and the application status/progress of the case will automatically be delivered to the applicant by text message as their case proceeds through the assessment process.  The PCRS is also finalising the development of a facility which will allow people to apply on-line if they wish.</P>
        <P>The most recent figures provided to my Department by the HSE show that in 2009, the PCRS processed over 72,000 medical card applications.  This included nearly 42,000 reviews.  In relation to these reviews, 85% of cases where the required information was supplied were completed within 20 days and 95% within 30 days.  The HSE has no control over delays where relevant information is not provided but it has confirmed that when the required information is received, the review is processed without further delay.</P>
        <P>The other information sought by the Deputy is not provided by the HSE to my Department, as a matter of routine. Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have these matters addressed and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of staff on a career break in the public health service at 30 November 2009 (latest data available) was 1,738 in whole time equivalent terms (WTEs).   The remaining information requested regarding the average length of career breaks, and the numbers of staff who have applied to return but are currently waiting for an appropriate position to become available, is a matter for the Health Service Executive.  As a result, this part of the question has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>With regards to the Incentivised Career Break Scheme, my Department issued a suite of three circulars to the HSE on 15 May 2009, which provided for the Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement (8/2009), the Incentivised Career Break Scheme (Circular 9/2009) and the Shorter Working Year (10/2009), as announced by the Minister for Finance in his Supplementary Budget Statement of 7 April 2009.</P>
        <P>The purpose of these circulars was to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff employed, along with an associated restructuring of organisation and operations, in as timely a manner as possible and in line with the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector.  While the reduction in numbers achieved under these schemes was intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer, this had to be done in a way that does not undermine essential service provision.</P>
        <P>The schemes did not apply to grades exempted from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions under the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector (Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians).  This was in order to meet the requirements of integrated health care delivery and, in particular, to address needs in the community in respect of care of the elderly and people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>Members of all other grades, who meet the eligibility criteria, had access to these schemes, provided the grades/staff groups concerned cooperated with the requirements in relation to redeployment, mobility, skill mix and flexibility which are outlined in the employment control framework: this was designed to allow individuals to avail of the schemes while still protecting services.  Because staff who retired under the schemes would not be replaced (save in very exceptional cases), employers were required to pay particular attention, when considering applications, to the scope that existed within the organisation for reorganising and restructuring <Col N="174"/>work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  Staff cooperation and flexibility in that regard was essential.</P>
        <P>My Department was informed that the health service trade unions issued a directive in May 2009 instructing their members not to cooperate with redeployment and reassignment requests from management in response to the introduction of the moratorium on recruitment and promotions as set out in 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector. This instruction from the unions, which remains in place, severely restricts the ability of management to organise/restructure work practice and contravenes the qualification criteria for the scheme.  As a result, the HSE suspended all three schemes in June 2009 but continued to accept applications, up to the closing date of 23 October 2009.  I understand a total of 299 applications for the incentivised career Break scheme have been received in the HSE.  Of this figure, 130 have been approved subject to the lifting of the current suspension on the scheme, 16 have been deferred, 150 refused and no decision has been made in respect of the remaining 3.</P>
        <P>The HSE recently requested my Department&rsquo;s approval to lift the suspension as it applied to the Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement (ISER), and to allow it to proceed to process to finalisation applications received prior to the closing date. This request is currently being considered by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>In relation to my Department, I wish to advise that a total of 30 staff are currently on career break. Seventeen of these are on the traditional career break scheme (under the terms of Department of Finance Circular 18/98) and the remaining 13 officers are availing of the new Special Civil Service Incentive Career Break Scheme 2009 (Circular 13/2009).</P>
        <P>The following statistics relate to the career break scheme under Department of Finance Circular 18/98: the average length of career break is 2.78 years (this excludes time spent by officers waiting to return from career break). Four officers have applied to return from career break for whom no position is currently available. The length of time they have been waiting for an appropriate position to become available is currently:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Less than one month:   1 </P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Less than three months: 0</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Less than six months:   1</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Six months or more:   2</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Of the 13 officers taking a career break under Special Civil Service Incentive Career Break Scheme, 9 commenced their break during 2009 and the remaining 4 will commence during 2010 following their return from maternity leave.</P>

        <P>The operation of the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE (PAD) allows for the centralised receipt, assignment and tracking of Parliamentary Questions within the HSE&rsquo;s extensive network of operations. More generally, PAD monitors overall performance in relation to the timely issue of replies and provides a central contact for all requests from Oireachtas members for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the Executive. It reports on a regular basis to the Chief Executive Officer and his management team.</P>
        <P>With regard to the number of Parliamentary Questions referred to the Executive for direct reply in the last three years, the details are as follows:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2007 &mdash; 2,744</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2008 &mdash; 3,544</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2009 &mdash; 3,145.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The information sought by the Deputy concerning the number of questions answered within one week, two weeks etc. is not available.  In 2007 the Executive worked to a timeframe of responding to referred questions within 20 working days and this target was met for 65% of referred questions. From January 2008, this timeframe was reduced to 15 working days and 73% of referred questions were answered within this period. In 2009, 62% of questions referred to the Executive were answered within the 15 day timeframe. The Executive is very conscious of the need for prompt responses to Parliamentary Questions and there is regular liaison between my Department and the Executive in this regard.  At my regular meetings with the CEO of the HSE I will continue to stress the importance of providing responses to Parliamentary Questions that are both prompt and of a high quality.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 260, 273 and 274 together.</P>
        <P>In the process of re-negotiating the bilateral agreement on inter-country adoption with Vietnam serious issues came to light in relation to the Vietnamese adoption process. The issues were contained in the report on inter-country adoption commissioned by UNICEF and the Vietnamese Ministry of Justice and carried out by International Social Services (ISS).  An earlier report published last August by the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social <Col N="176"/>Affairs (MOLISA) was also considered in this regard. The UNICEF/ISS report, which was accepted by the Vietnamese Government, &ldquo;proposes that Vietnam suspends inter-country adoptions for the necessary period during the year 2010 that will enable it to ensure optimal implementation of the Hague Convention and to prepare for the entry into force of the new law on adoption in 2011&rdquo;.  The Report also raises serious questions regarding adoption practices in Vietnam, including as follows:</P>
        <P el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>inter-country adoptions from Vietnam are essentially influenced by foreign demand, i.e. the availability of children who are &ldquo;adoptable&rdquo; abroad corresponds more to the existence of foreign prospective adopters than to the actual needs of &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; and orphaned children;</P>
       <P el="5">(b) <?oasys _ix ?>the circumstances under which babies become &ldquo;adoptable&rdquo; are invariably unclear and disturbing;</P>
       <P el="5">(c) <?oasys _ix ?>the inter-country adoption  system is grounded in a remarkably unhealthy relationship between the mediating agencies and specific residential facilities; and</P>
     <P el="5">(d) <?oasys _ix ?>Governments and central authorities of &ldquo;receiving countries&rdquo; collectively at least, and individually in many instances have not effectively committed themselves to applying the basic principles of the Hague Convention or the recommendations of the treaty&rsquo;s practical operation, in their dealings with Vietnam.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Having considered the contents of the two reports the Government decided, on 13th of January, to suspend indefinitely negotiations on a new bilateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  As a result of this decision, all inter-country adoptions from Vietnam will be suspended until such time as the Adoption Bill 2009 has been enacted and both Ireland and Vietnam have ratified the provisions of the Hague Convention.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 263, 326 and 335 together.</P>
        <P>The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and its associated regulations control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act. Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Items available for sale in head shops, and which are often referred to as &lsquo;legal highs&rsquo;, are substances which are not currently controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation. The list of scheduled substances is kept under ongoing review. For example, in 2006 psychotropic (&lsquo;magic&rsquo;) mushrooms, which were on sale in such outlets, were banned and their possession and sale is now illegal. On 31 March 2009, BZP was similarly subjected to legislative control measures and criminal sanctions.  Minister John Curran, Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, who has responsibility for co-ordinating the National Drugs Strategy, has identified head shops as an area of concern, and is currently considering the options available to more effectively control the activities of head shops.</P>
        <P>Under the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, a Research Advisory Group has been established to identify possible options for the regulation of head shops and the Department is actively participating in this process.  In the UK, legislation was introduced immediately before Christmas to control a number of substances and groups of substances that have been on sale in head shops. The Department is currently reviewing this legislation to ascertain how similar controls could be introduced in Ireland.  My Department does not have information in relation to the number of head shops which are operating in Ireland.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 266 together.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  Future inter-country adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.</P>
        <P>The current policy position, as set out in the Adoption Bill 2009, is that for an adoption to be registered under the Bill it must be effected in a contracting State to the Hague Convention or in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement. For non-Hague countries only those adoptions effected prior to the commencement of the new law can be registered on the Register of Inter-Country Adoptions to be established under the Bill.</P>
        <P>The issue of transitional measures for prospective parents who are at a definable stage in the adoption process when the Bill is enacted and who wish to continue to adopt a child from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country, is being examined.  Prospective adoptive parents have waited a long time and it is my intention to be as flexible as possible in relation to applicants.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding the number of applications for adoptions from Ethiopia and Russia, such information is not maintained in my Office.  As this is a service matter I have forwarded this aspect of the Deputy&rsquo;s query to the Health Service Executive and asked that a reply issue directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The conclusion of bilateral agreements on adoption with any country must take place in the context of the best information available to authorities at the time the agreement is being concluded.  This was the case in relation to the bilateral agreement with Vietnam which expired on 1 May 2009.</P>
        <P>We must constantly strive to improve inter-country adoption standards.  These standards evolve over time and must reflect best practice at any particular time.

        <P>The Joint Working Group referred to by the Deputy did not meet on a formal basis.

        <P>Representatives of my Department and/or the Adoption Board met with their Vietnamese counterparts as required to review issues relating to adoptions from Vietnam on foot of the Agreement.  Officials from my Department visited Vietnam on at least 5 occasions since the signing of the bilateral agreement in 2003.  During the course of these visits some of the matters discussed included co-operation on technical assistance, staff training, providing assistance to State competent authorities involved in adoption and the care of children as referred to in Article 24 of the Bilateral Agreement.  As a part of this process two significant reports were produced which helped to inform the Government&rsquo;s policy on adoption from Vietnam.</P>

	<P>My Office became aware of concerns around aspects of the operation of the mediation agency in question upon receipt of the &lsquo;draft Final Report&rsquo; of the &lsquo;Assessment of the Adoption System in Vietnam&rsquo; by ISS in mid August last year.  The Adoption Board were contacted immediately upon receipt of the draft report. The Adoption Board&rsquo;s role in registering adoption societies, including the mediation agency in question, makes it the appropriate body to consider the issues raised.</P>
        <P>The payment of humanitarian aid as part of the adoption process was provided for in the previous bilateral agreement.  However, the Vietnamese authorities themselves wish to break the link between the referral of a child for adoption and the payment of humanitarian aid.</P>

	<P>Recently I requested the HSE to initiate a tendering process for the procurement of a HPV vaccine with a view to commencing a HPV vaccination programme for all girls in first year in secondary school.  This tendering process for the vaccine is now complete.  We can now purchase the vaccine at a price much lower than we expected to pay in 2008 and at a price much closer to what is being paid in other countries.  In these circumstances, the programme can now be delivered from the extra resources committed in this year&rsquo;s budget to the overall Cancer Programme.  The HSE is committed to starting this campaign during the current school year.  This will involve the free vaccination of up to 30,000 girls mainly in school settings and an announcement of the details of the full programme involved will be made by the HSE in the near future.  The programme will continue with vaccine being offered to all girls in first year in secondary school each year but it is not proposed to extend the vaccination programme to other classes at present.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 276, 328 and 329 together.</P>
        <P>The Government has established an Interdepartmental Committee under the Chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in order to provide for ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Department of Health and Children is represented on the Committee.  The Mental Health Act 2001 provides a modern framework for the admission and treatment of persons with a mental disorder.  It provides important safeguards to people who are involuntarily admitted by ensuring that all admission and renewal orders are subject to automatic and independent review by a Mental Health Tribunal.  The Act also established the Mental Health Commission which is responsible for promoting, encouraging and fostering the establishment of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and taking all reasonable steps to protect the interests of persons detained in approved centres.  The Act is due to be reviewed in 2011 and the provisions of the UN Convention will be among the issues to be considered in that context.  The review will also consider whether further provisions are required in relation to community-based mental health services.</P><Col N="182"/>
        <P>Ireland has a comprehensive mental health policy framework in place which outlines a set of values and principles that will guide both Government and service providers as we proceed to develop and put in place a modern high- quality mental health service.  This policy document &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; proposes a holistic view of mental illness and recommends an integrated multidisciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems.  It recommends a person centred treatment approach which addressed each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice, and most importantly evolved and agreed with both service users and their carers.</P>
        <P>In January 2008, the Government established the Office for Disability and Mental Health as a cross-cutting Government Office with a remit across four Government Departments: Health and Children, Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Office provides for greater cohesion across the public service and brings together responsibility for a range of different policy areas and State services.  The Office was assigned four key priorities one of which is to bring  a new impetus to the implementation of &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; working in partnership with the HSE and other stakeholders including other Government Departments to achieve implementation of agreed targets.  Bilateral meetings with officials from other Government Departments to discuss progressing recommendations in &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reach Out&rsquo; the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention take place within this context.</P>

	<P>Details of the number of medical cards and GP visit cards are provided to my Department each month by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The figures are provided on a net basis, showing the balance after new cards have been issued and other cards, as appropriate, have been deleted from the Executive&rsquo;s database, e.g. following a review of a person&rsquo;s circumstances.  The most recent figures provided to my Department by the HSE reflect the position on 31st December 2009 and show 1,478,560 medical card holders on that date, of whom 337,519 were aged 70 and over.  The Health Service Executive, with my full support, has decided to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals at its Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin. </P>
        <P>The process commenced in January 2009 when the PCRS took over the processing of all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices (LHOs) in Dublin to the PCRS.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the PCRS processed over 72,000 medical card applications.  This included nearly 42,000 reviews.  In relation to these reviews, 85% of cases where the required information was supplied were completed within 20 days and 95% within 30 days.  The HSE has no control over delays where relevant information is not provided but it has confirmed that when the required information is received, the review is processed without further delay.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, the initiative to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals will ensure:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Improved turnaround times for processing of applications: under the new arrangements the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 working days or less, with provision for emergency applications to be dealt with immediately;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Consistent and equitable application of eligibility and service provision;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Clearer governance and accountability, as well as improved management information; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A reduction in the overall number of staff required to process medical/GP visit card applications, thus freeing up staff for other service needs.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />As parts of the information sought by the Deputy are not provided by the HSE to my Department as a matter of routine, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address these matters and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Developing and improving our overall infrastructure, including health infrastructure is crucial to Ireland&rsquo;s economic future.  In 2010, the Health Sector will benefit from a total capital investment of  &euro;483.842m which will help to stimulate economic growth through the progression of wide range of capital health developments countrywide. </P>
        <P>A draft capital plan for the period 2010 &mdash; 2014 has been submitted to my Department by the Health Service Executive.  My Department is reviewing the proposals and following up with the HSE where further details may be required.  The proposed plan requires my approval with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Details of the plan will be published by the HSE following its approval.</P>
        <P>I have asked the HSE to provide details of capital projects currently under construction.</P>
        <P>The HSE has carefully managed its capital programme following confirmation of  revisions to its capital envelope in 2009, so as to ensure, inter alia, that construction tenders where issued, related to priority projects expected to proceed without delay to completion.  I have requested the HSE to provide details of any projects previously tendered that will not proceed in 2010, following approval of the capital plan.</P>

	<P>The position in Ireland is that cannabis, and substances and products containing cannabis, are considered as having no medicinal use and are classified as controlled drugs under Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, as amended.  The importation, exportation, manufacture, production, preparation, sale, supply, distribution and possession of cannabis, and products and substances containing cannabis, is unlawful except for the purposes of research.  The Misuse of Drugs legislation applies more stringent controls than the UN or EU legislation regarding the use of medicinal cannabis. </P>
        <P>The importation of cannabis and substances and products containing cannabis to Ireland, even if legally obtained in another EU Member State, is prohibited. It is not possible for cannabis, products containing cannabis or derivatives thereof to be authorised for medicinal use or for prescription by a medical practitioner.  The Misuse of Drugs legislation makes no provision for derogations in respect of the importation or possession of cannabis-containing substances or products.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 297 and 300 together.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.</P>
        <P>The current policy position, as set out in the Adoption Bill 2009, is that for an adoption to be registered under the Bill it must be effected in a contracting State to the Hague Convention or in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement. For non-Hague countries only those adoptions effected prior to the commencement of the new law can be registered on the Register of Inter-Country Adoptions to be established under the Bill.</P>
        <P>The issue of transitional measures for prospective parents who are at a definable stage in the adoption process when the Bill is enacted and who wish to continue to adopt a child from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country, is being examined.  Prospective adoptive parents have waited a long time and it is my intention to be as flexible as possible in relation to applicants.</P><Col N="188"/>
        <P>Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia in respect of adoption. Consideration of this matter is at an early stage.</P>
        <P>I will be meeting the organisation specified by the Deputy when I address its annual general meeting in February.</P>

	<P>I have responsibility for the implementation of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which commenced earlier this month.  I also have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) under which capital grants were provided to community and commercial childcare providers to develop and refurbish childcare facilities to meet the needs of parents and their children.</P>
        <P>Some 27,000 additional childcare places are expected to be created under the NCIP.  This builds on the 45,000 childcare places created under the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP).  In order to qualify for capital grant funding under <Col N="189"/>the NCIP, applicants were required to demonstrate a local need for the service proposed, including non-displacement of existing services in the area.  Applications were processed in the first instance by the local City and County Childcare Committee who provided detailed assessments of each project and the extent to which the funding proposed would address identified local childcare needs.  The NCIP capital programme closed to new applicants in April 2009.</P>
        <P>In addition to capital funding, the NCIP also provides support funding under the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) to enable community childcare services to charge reduced fees to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  In December 2009, the Government announced its decision to introduce a follow-on scheme to the CCSS with effect from September 2010.</P>
        <P>While the NCIP is an investment programme to develop the childcare infrastructure and provide targeted support to disadvantaged parents using community services, the ECCE scheme is a universal scheme to provide a free preschool year to all children before they enter primary school.  All preschool  services operating in the State are free to apply to participate, including preschool services established by the Boards of Management of primary schools or located on school grounds.  It is not possible, therefore, nor would it be considered appropriate to limit the ECCE scheme to existing services preschool services or to discriminate against a particular category of provider.</P>

	<P>The HSE&rsquo;s Guidelines on the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme state that, subject to overall resources, new entrants to nursing homes will have their financial support paid either from the date that the application was made or from date of admission to the nursing home, whichever is the later.  It is not, therefore, the case that applicants will only qualify from the date of approval.</P>
        <P>The HSE has indicated that the expected timelines for processing applications under the new Nursing Home Support Scheme and making determination regarding financial support will vary according to individual circumstances and complexities.  However, on average, the following timelines are estimated:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Straightforward State Support Application &mdash; 1-2 weeks.</P>

	<P>Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not feasible, to support access to quality, long-term affordable residential care. </P>
        <P>The Home Care Package (HCP) Initiative was introduced in 2006. This year, the Government has made available a total of &euro;130m to allow the HSE provide packages to some 9,000 people at any one time or around 12,500 people during the course of the year.  This includes an additional &euro;10m provided in the recent Budget. Such packages provide supports over and above existing mainstream community services to help maintain older people at home and in their communities.  They are targeted particularly at older people at risk of inappropriate admission to acute hospital or long-term residential care, or those requiring discharge home from acute hospital. They were designed to be as flexible as possible to best meet the needs of each <Col N="193"/>individual. These criteria were indicated to the HSE when packages were introduced, and have been the basis for administering the programme since.</P>
        <P>The capacity of the HSE to provide approved levels of  Home Care Package services continues to be reviewed in the context of overall resources available to the Executive. It is incumbent on each Local Health Manager to ensure that HCPs are delivered within allocated budgets. This requires a stringent on-going review of the application of resources.</P>
        <P>Levels of services provided under the HCP Initiative are reviewed regularly by the HSE. As a result, the service in individual cases may increase, decrease or may remain the same, based on the assessed need of the individual.  Professional staff on the front line, who are aware of local circumstances, undertake individual client assessments and services are targeted at clients with a high level of dependency and in accordance with their assessed need.</P>
 <?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>An independent Evaluation of Home Care Packages was commissioned by the Department and undertaken by PA Consulting in 2009, and was published on 3 December last. The recommendations of this report, including a more standardised approach to means assessment, will help inform future policy and direction for this service. Following the findings of this report, the Department is satisfied that the funding for HCPs, which is a limited resource, has been used as intended by the HSE. It accepts the recommendations on the need for a more standardised approach to various aspects of the programme. These would include Governance, Operational Delivery, Performance Management, and Funding.</P>
        <P>The Department, and the HSE, are at present progressing the implementation of the recommendations of the PA report on Home Care Packages in 2010 including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />agreeing national standardised access and operational guidelines for delivery of Home Care Packages,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the adoption  and dissemination by  the HSE of a voluntary code of <i>Quality Guidelines for Home Care Support Services for Older People, </i>which will apply to public and private providers, and</P>

	<P>The position remains as outlined in my reply to Question No. 63 of 19th February 2009, namely that when a patient has a limb amputated, the acute hospital is responsible for providing the first prosthesis.  Amputees who possess a Medical Card or a Long-Term Illness Card will receive, once sanctioned, new prostheses and repairs to prostheses. Others are liable to meet the costs directly.  They have a number of options: (a) they can claim from their private health insurers; (b) they can meet the costs themselves and submit a claim for tax relief to the Revenue Commissioners via the Form Med 1 and (c) they can apply for a Medical Card and request that their special circumstances be considered, especially on the grounds of &ldquo;undue financial hardship&rdquo; on the individual or their family.</P>

	<P>I fully support the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s decision to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals at the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin as the Executive has advised that when fully implemented, the initiative will ensure:</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers,  the Government decided that, with effect from 27 March 2009 to end 2010, no post in the public sector, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade. The decision applies to all grades of permanent and temporary staff, including nursing, notwithstanding a number of specific exemptions, some of which are highlighted below. A HSE circular has issued which gives effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.</P>
        <P>The Government decision was modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability. The HSE has been focussing on the scope that exists within the health services for reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery. The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community to facilitate the development of integrated care. It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.</P>
        <P>In addition, the employment control framework specifically exempts the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians. The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling for the health sector. In addition, special provisions apply in relation to certain specialist grades under the National Cancer Control Programme.</P><Col N="196"/>
        <P>The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided. The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.</P>
        <P>Health employment levels are monitored by the Joint Employment Control Monitoring Committee, which comprises officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the HSE. This committee also reviews the implementation of the moratorium and any issues arising.</P>
        <P>The position in regard to the management of employment levels in specific areas is a service matter, and the Deputy&rsquo;s question has accordingly been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</P>

	<P>I remain committed to the development of rail transportation in Ireland.  This commitment is reflected in the provision of over &euro;600m in Exchequer funding for investment in public transport infrastructure in 2010.  Significant progress has been made in the recent past through investment in the rail network such as under the railway safety programme, the purchase of new carriages and the opening of the Cork to Midleton rail line.  Further progress will be made this year with the opening of phase 1 of the Western Rail Corridor, the completion of the upgrade of the Kildare line and the opening of phase 1 of the Navan line.</P>
        <P>As I have stated previously my priority for future investment in public transport infrastructure is the provision of additional capacity and, in this regard, Metro North and DART Underground are important projects.  More generally, the transport infrastructure projects and programmes selected for continued investment will be guided by the overarching priorities set out by the Minister for Finance for capital investment, namely strengthening the productive capacity of the economy and sustaining employment.  Investment in this infrastructure will add to Ireland&rsquo;s capital stock and help support the development of a competitive productive economy in the long term.</P>

	<P>I responded directly to the person in question on 25th January 2010. A copy of the letter is set out below for the information of the Deputy.</P>
<P el="3">January 2010</P>
<P el="3">Ms Lisa Doyle</P>
<P el="3">Lisadoyle61@hotmail.co.uk</P>
<P el="3">Dear Ms Doyle,</P>
<P el="3">I refer further to your email regarding Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann services to/from Laytown, Co. Meath. </P>
        <P>As I am sure you appreciate a number of the issues raised in your letter are day-to-day operational matters for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  However, given that you went to the trouble of contacting me to voice your concerns and to try and be helpful in responding to you my Department raised these matters directly with the company and asked for a response.</P>
        <P>At the outset it might be useful to advise you that I have in recent months introduced significant reforms in relation to arrangements for the delivery of public transport infrastructure and services.  The National Transport Authority was recently established and this body now has statutory responsibility to procure public transport services and, in relation to the Greater Dublin Area, secure public transport infrastructure on behalf of the State.  The new Authority has recently entered into public service contracts with each of the CIE companies.  The purpose of these contracts is to set enforceable standards in relation to the quality and quantity of services provided to the State in return for the payment of State subvention.</P>
        <P>Your specific queries related to ticket pricing, the rail service to Laytown, Exchequer and EU funding of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the plans to enhance rail services in the Greater Dublin Area under the Transport 21 Investment Framework.  I shall seek to address each of these in turn.</P>
        <P>As part of the reforms I referred to earlier the approval of fare increases for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is now the responsibility of the recently established National Transport Authority.  Prior to the setting up of the Authority, my Department approved the standard single fare in respect of bus and rail services provided by the CI&Eacute; companies.  This is now a matter for the Authority.  Return fares, discounted fares, concessionary fares etc. are a matter for the companies concerned.  No increase is proposed for 2010 in the price of the annual Taxsaver commuter ticket from Laytown to Dublin.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has advised my Department in response to your letter that the price of &euro;1,770 quoted by yourself has been the price of that ticket that has applied since March 2009 and ticket prices are based broadly on distance travelled.  For example Laytown is 42km from Dublin and the annual ticket costs &euro;1,700 whereas, in comparison, Skerries is 28km from Dublin and the annual ticket cost is &euro;1,030.</P>
        <P>In relation to train services, in this case services from Laytown, again, this is a day-to-day operational matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. On this issue Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has stated that in the morning peak hour, it provides 5 departures from Laytown arriving in Dublin between 8am and 9am.  This is an average frequency of a train every 12 minutes, which is comparable with DART frequencies.  In the evening peak hour, there are 4 departures from Dublin to Laytown between 5.15pm and 6.15pm, which would also be similar to train frequencies on other routes <Col N="198"/>such as the Maynooth line.  In relation to the quality and reliability of such services, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have also advised my Department that prior to the Malahide Viaduct incident on the 21st of August 2009, that 93.6% of trains on the northern commuter line were arriving on time or within 5 minutes of schedule.  The company has indicated that, since the reintroduction of services following the reconstruction of the viaduct, there have been some temporary speed restrictions in place on the line.  However, a number of these have already been removed and punctuality has returned to 95.45% of trains arriving within 10 minutes of schedule.</P>
        <P>With regard to Exchequer and EU Capital Funding, over the last 5 years 2005 to 2009, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has received funding for the Transport 21 capital investment programme from the Exchequer and EU as set out in the following table.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Transport 21 programme for rail has included the infrastructure renewal programme, the rolling stock replacement programme, station upgrading and accessibility works and car parking extensions.  In Laytown, in particular, &euro;1.5m has been provided for station accessibility works and these are nearing completion</P>
        <P>In terms of appraising projects, my Department fully complies with the Department of Finance Guidelines on &ldquo;The Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector&rdquo;. For your information, this can be found at http://www.finance.gov.ie/ documents/publications/other/capappguide05.pdf</P>
        <P>As I stated in a press release on 9th December the public transport subvention provision payable to CIE is &euro;276 million for 2010, which is a reduction of &euro;27 million (8.8%) in 2009.  This reduction reflects the need to reduce public expenditure in the current very difficult economic climate.  The CIE companies will seek to minimise the impact by continuing their work to reduce costs and increase efficiency.

Work is currently underway on the scheme design, geotechnical investigation and preparation of an environmental impact study including a detailed archaeological report.

	<P>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national road and bridge projects, including those within Cork County Council&rsquo;s functional area, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Grants in respect of national roads are allocated to local authorities by the NRA and I have no function in this regard.</P>
        <P>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  The carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.</P>
        <P>The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</P>
        <P>In determining the annual regional and local road grant allocations, the overall objective is to resource each local area, including Cork County Council, appropriately in relation to their ongoing and special needs.</P>
        <P>Grants are provided each year to local authorities for works on regional and local roads under a number of grant categories.  The level of grants allocated to individual authorities is determined each year having regard to the total funds available in a particular year; eligibility criteria for the different grant schemes; road pavement conditions; length of road network; the need to prioritise projects and competing demands from other local authorities.</P>
        <P>The amount of money provided in the 2010 Estimates for funding regional and local roads is &euro;411.177 million and this year&rsquo;s allocation will be based on that amount.</P>
        <P>I will announce the 2010 regional and local road grant allocations by mid February 2010.</P>

        <Quest> the various charges and fees set by him in relation to driving licences, applications for driving licences and tests of driving ability in relation to his powers under Section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968; if those charges and fees have changed in 2007, 2008 or 2009; the annual income that is expected to accrue from each such charge; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>Current fees in relation to driving licences were set in the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 537 of 2006) and remain unchanged.  The fees for driving tests were increased from 7 April 2009 by the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) (Amendment) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 130 of 2009) to &euro;75 in respect of cars and motorcycles and &euro;110 in respect of other vehicles (trucks and buses).  The fees relating to the professional competence of drivers were set in the European Communities (Vehicle Drivers Certificate of Professional Competence) (No. 2) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 359 of 2008) and remain unchanged.  The fees in respect of applications for driving licences and tests of driving ability had previously been unchanged for a number of years.</P><Col N="205"/>

        <Quest> if additional funding will be made available to counties Cavan and Monaghan to help cover the cost that each of the councils incurred in keeping the roads clear and additionally to cover the damage which has been done to the road surfaces; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

The carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</P>
        <P>When Exchequer grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, my Department does not hold back a reserve allocation, at central level, to deal with weather contingencies.  Holding back such an allocation would mean a reduction in the road grant allocations made to all local authorities at the beginning of each year.</P>
        <P>The allocations made to local authorities are inclusive of a weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised in the annual road grants circular letter that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.</P>
        <P>The amount of money provided in the 2010 Estimates for funding regional and local roads is &euro;411.177 million and this year&rsquo;s allocation will be based on that amount.</P>
        <P>I have, however, asked local authorities to provide details of exceptional road related costs associated with the recent flooding and prolonged severe weather, which fall outside the normal financial provision for winter maintenance.</P>
        <P>I will announce the 2010 regional and local road grant allocations by mid February 2010 at the latest.</P>

	<P>The Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s Consultation Paper on Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement, published in September 2009, contains an extensive list of provisional recommendations for reform of the law on per<Col N="209"/>sonal debt that includes provision for a system of non-judicial debt settlement.  While the system of Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVA&rsquo;s) that operates in the United Kingdom is referred to in the Paper in that context, no recommendation is made in that regard.  The Commission has indicated that the date for completion of submissions on its Paper is the end of January 2010.  It is aiming to have its Final Report available by end of August 2010.  </P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government intends that early action be taken by the relevant Departments, including my Department, to address the Commission&rsquo;s final views on all matters, including those on non-judicial debt settlement systems.</P>

	<P>The person concerned, accompanied by her infant child, applied for asylum on 23 April 2003.  The child was included in his mother&rsquo;s asylum application.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned and her child were entitled to remain in the State until her application for asylum was decided.  Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 17 May 2004, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her child.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against her and her child.  Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned at that time.</P>
        <P>Her case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement and all representations received were considered in arriving at a decision in her case.  On 27 October 2004 Deportation Orders were signed in respect of the person concerned and her child.  Notice of these Orders was served by registered post dated 27 January 2005.  This communication advised the person concerned of the legal requirement that she and her child present themselves at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 3 February 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for their deportation from the State.  The person concerned &lsquo;presented&rsquo; on that occasion and on a number of subsequent dates but has failed to &lsquo;present&rsquo; since 5 July 2005.</P>
        <P>On 6 October 2005, the person concerned initiated Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court, challenging the Minister&rsquo;s decision to make Deportation Orders in this case.  On 23 March 2007, the High Court refused the Judicial Review Leave Application.</P>
        <P>On 1 November 2005, an application was received on behalf of the child of the person concerned requesting that he be re-admitted to the asylum process in accordance with the provisions of Section 17(7) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended). Following the consideration of this application, a decision was taken to refuse the application and the person concerned was notified of this refusal decision by letter dated 18 November 2005.</P>
        <P>An application for the revocation of the Deportation Orders, under Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), has also been submitted on behalf of the person concerned.  This application is under consideration in my Department at present.  When a decision has been made on this application, the person concerned will be notified in writing of that decision and of the consequences of the decision.</P>
        <P>The person concerned and her child remain the subject of valid Deportation Orders.  The Deputy may be assured that these Orders will not be enforced pending the determination of the application for the revocation of the Deportation Orders as referred to above.</P>

Garda&iacute; <Col N="211"/>from the Neighbourhood Policing Unit engage with the community and community leaders in the area, and regular meetings are held to address any issues that arise.</P>
        <P>Residents of the area have been reassured of Garda commitment to the area.  Any issues arising or fears being expressed or experienced by members of the community will be addressed by local Garda management.</P>
        <P>The area is subject to regular foot and mobile patrols and patrols by the Garda Mountain Bike Unit, supplemented by the District Detective and Drug Units and the Divisional Crime Task Force.</P>
        <P>Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences, including the prevention of crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of residents.  Community policing is a central feature of the policing plans.  This strategy is central to the delivery of the policing service to the area in question.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that the incident referred to is the subject of ongoing investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with one person charged.  It would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

        <P>In relation to the treatment of such cases where an applicant reaches 18 years, the same legal entitlements and provisions will apply to such persons as would to cases involving persons who were adults at the time an asylum claim was lodged. For this reason, it is not possible to dis-aggregate the cases of previously unaccompanied children who were subsequently granted permission to remain in the State from the overall figures for persons granted permission to remain in the State.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might also wish to note that it is not uncommon for persons arriving in the State as unaccompanied children to be re-united with family members already in the State and once such re-unification is achieved, the HSE will no longer be required to act as guardian to such children.</P>

        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that policy for the care of children in the criminal justice system is outlined in the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010, one of the actions of which states that the Department of Health and Children will work with the HSE to implement the recommendations of the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, to increase access to appropriate child and adolescent mental health services for children in the youth justice system.</P>
        <P>Also, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Report Implementation Plan, commonly known as the Ryan Implementation Plan, states &lsquo;In conjunction with the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS), the HSE will develop a national specialist multidisciplinary team for children in special care and detention by July 2010&rsquo;.  I understand the HSE is currently working  to progress this recommendation.</P>
        <P>In relation to children in detention schools, I can advise the Deputy that each of the children detention schools provides access to specialist mental health assessments and appropriate treatment.  Mental health care in the community is a matter for the HSE, however, the IYJS is working with the HSE to ensure that offending children with mental health issues are identified at the earliest opportunity and diverted from the criminal justice system where possible.</P>
        <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that while officials in my Department are aware of the new children&rsquo;s mental health coalition, my office has not received any proposals from this group to date.  Any proposals received in the future will be given due consideration.</P>

        <P>All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of the application has commenced and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

No 518 of 2006 (&lsquo;the Regulations&rsquo;). On 19 October 2006 my Department informed the applicant that the regulations are not applicable in cases where a deportation order was made before coming into operation of the regulations on 10 October 2006.</P>
        <P>The applicant instituted Judicial Review proceedings on 9 November 2006 challenging the decision not to process an application for Subsidiary Protection. These proceedings were settled on the 4 December 2007 following the finding of Justice Feeney in the cases of Hila and Djolo that I have a discretion under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 S.I No. 518 of 2006 to accept and consider applications for subsidiary protection from persons who do not have an automatic right to apply but who have identified new facts or circumstances which demonstrate a change of position from that which pertained at the time the deportation order was made. Following a subsequent consideration of the material submitted by the applicant, it was concluded on 18 March, 2008 that she had established no grounds which would enable me to exercise my discretion under Regulation 4(2) to consider an application for subsidiary protection from her.  The applicant instituted further Judicial Review proceedings on 11 April, 2008 challenging that decision and accordingly, as the matter is sub judice, I do not propose to comment further.</P>

	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland which are registered with the GCVU and which employ personnel to work in a full-time, part time, voluntary or student capacity with children and/or vulnerable adults.  The Teaching Council is the organisation registered with the Garda Central Vetting Unit to submit Garda Vetting applications in respect of new teachers.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that all applications received from the Teaching Council in respect of new teachers are processed in accordance with the GCVU&rsquo;s standard operating procedures and the results in respect of each individual applicant are disclosed to the registered organisation.  I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that discussions are ongoing regarding the process of vetting of existing teachers, in the context of the continu<Col N="223"/>ing expansion and enhancement of Garda vetting.  These vetting applications will also be submitted through the Teaching Council. This process is expected to commence during 2010.</P>
        <P>The current average processing time for valid vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately 6 weeks.  This processing time may fluctuate due to seasonal demands and the volume of applications received.  The timeframe may be longer in cases where further enquiries need to be made in individual cases.  A total of 78 personnel is assigned to the GCVU at present, the same allocation as at this time in 2009.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned as dedicated Community Garda&iacute; has increased from 709 at the end of December 2008 to 1,058 at the end of December 2009; an increase of almost fifty percent.  The work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is driven by a community policing ethos.  The new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na National Model of Community Policing was launched last year to deliver:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a consistent national structure to the Community Policing function;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a more coordinated and efficient Garda service to the community; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the spread of good practices and quality service in Community Policing on a national basis.</P><Col N="226"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Community Alert, set up by Muintir na T&iacute;re in association with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1985, is a national movement comprising over 1,300 local groups dedicated to improving the quality of life of people in rural communities who are vulnerable, in particular the elderly, by:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />preventing crime;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />promoting general community safety and well-being;</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />promoting neighbourliness and self-reliance; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />having an anti-poverty focus and awareness of social inclusion.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department provides financial support to Community Alert. Neighbourhood Watch was established by the Garda&iacute; to enlist the voluntary help of the community in cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and operates mainly in urban areas.  It promotes community participation and good citizenship at a time when sections of our community are in danger of becoming marginalised.  Its importance lies in reducing opportunities for crime by improving personal and home security, including the security of older people, and fostering a community spirit where neighbours look out for each other.  The programme is administered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the Garda Community Relations Division.</P>
        <P>I am informed that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs provides grant support for community and voluntary organisations to address the isolation and security needs of older people.  The Scheme of Community Support for Older People has enabled the installation of monitored alert systems since 1996.  The Department estimates that the homes of some 90,000 older people are currently monitored on a 24 hour seven day basis.  The Scheme was reviewed during 2009.  The Review called for closer working relationships at local level between community groups working with older people, the fire services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to improve coordination and lessen the risks for older people living alone.  I am informed that an improved Scheme will become available in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, provision is made under the Firearms Acts, as amended, including the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 that, before granting a Firearm Certificate to any person, a Superintendent or a Chief Superintendent, as the case may be, shall be satisfied that an applicant: </P>
        <P el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>has a good reason for requiring the firearm in respect of which the certificate is applied for, and</P><Col N="227"/>
        <P el="5">(b) <?oasys _ix ?>can be permitted to have in his possession, use, and carry a firearm or ammunition without danger to the public safety or to the peace, and</P>
        <P el="5">(c) <?oasys _ix ?>is not a person declared to be disentitled to hold a firearms certificate under the Firearms Acts.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These three conditions must be satisfied in respect of every application, thereby ensuring that Firearm Certificates are granted to responsible persons. Additionally, a Chief Superintendent, when considering an application for a Restricted Firearm Certificate, must be satisfied that the applicant has &lsquo;demonstrated that the firearm is the only weapon suitable for the purpose for which it is required&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>The licensing of firearms is an operational matter and each application is judged on its own individual merits and the decision on whether, or not, to grant a Firearm Certificate rests solely with the issuing person.  The decision of the issuing person cannot be fettered in any way and I have no role in the matter.  Where an issuing person refuses an application for a firearms certificate the reason for such refusal shall be communicated to the applicant, in writing, within three months of the valid application being received. Applicants, who have been refused and are dissatisfied with the decision of an issuing person, have recourse to appeal that decision, within 30 days, to the District Court, in accordance with the provisions of section 43, Criminal Justice Act, 2006.</P>

	<P>The person concerned, accompanied by her infant child, applied for asylum on 23 April 2003. The child was included in his mother&rsquo;s asylum application.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned and her child were entitled to remain in the State until her application for asylum was decided.  Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 17 May 2004, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her child.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against her and her child. Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned at that time.</P>
        <P>Her case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement and all representations received were considered in arriving at a decision in her case. On 27 October 2004 Deportation Orders were signed in respect of the person concerned and her child. Notice of these Orders was served by registered post dated 27 January 2005. This communication advised the person concerned of the legal requirement that she and her child present themselves at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 3 February 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for their deportation from the State. The person concerned <Col N="228"/>&lsquo;presented&rsquo; on that occasion and on a number of subsequent dates but has failed to &lsquo;present&rsquo; since 5 July 2005.</P>
        <P>On 6 October 2005, the person concerned initiated Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court, challenging the Minister&rsquo;s decision to make Deportation Orders in this case. On 23 March 2007, the High Court refused the Judicial Review Leave Application.  On 1 November 2005, an application was received on behalf of the child of the person concerned requesting that he be re-admitted to the asylum process in accordance with the provisions of Section 17(7) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended). Following the consideration of this application, a decision was taken to refuse the application and the person concerned was notified of this refusal decision by letter dated 18 November 2005.</P>
        <P>An application for the revocation of the Deportation Orders, under Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), has also been submitted on behalf of the person concerned. This application is under consideration in my Department at present. When a decision has been made on this application, the person concerned will be notified in writing of that decision and of the consequences of the decision.  The person concerned and her child remain the subject of valid Deportation Orders.  The Deputy may be assured that these Orders will not be enforced pending the determination of the application for the revocation of the Deportation Orders as referred to above.</P>

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in January 2007.  All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straightforward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the number of full-time equivalent civilian staff employed in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at 31st December 2009 was 2,108. The equivalent figure at 31st December 2006 was 1,282. This represents an increase of 826 (or 64.4%) in civilian personnel strength over this period. Civilian staff are involved in the provision of a wide range of important support services in the administrative, professional, technical and industrial areas, including Human Resources, Training and Development, IT and Telecommunications, Finance and Procurement, Internal Audit, Communications, Research and Analysis, Accommodation and Fleet Management, Scene-of-crime support and Medical services.</P>
        <P>Civilians at many different grades have been recruited into the Force, and an example of this civilianisation process is that clerical officers were recruited and assigned to positions throughout the country in Garda stations and also in such units as the Garda Central Vetting Unit, Garda Fixed Penalty Office in Thurles, and the Garda Information Services centre in Castlebar.  The increased number of civilian support staff has released sworn members who were performing exclusively clerical, administrative or technical duties for operational duties. It has also allowed sworn members who would otherwise have to perform some administrative duties to focus exclusively on front-line policing duties. The civilian support staff may also perform new or expanded administrative, managerial and professional support roles in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The entire world has been deeply moved by the plight of the Haitian people following the earthquake there. The devastation wrought and the impact on peoples&rsquo; lives were made all the worse by the levels of poverty experienced by most Haitians.  The Haitian Government reports that more than 150,000 are dead, although that number could rise as reports from outside of Port-au-Prince are collated. There has been widespread destruction of infrastructure, including to schools and hospitals. Water and electricity supplies were severely damaged and there is growing concern about the spread of disease. Following the completion of search and rescue operations, attention now is focused fully on helping the survivors of the earthquake.</P>
        <P>The Government responded immediately and within hours of the earthquake, Irish Aid was in contact with NGOs such as Concern and Goal to make emergency funding available to these organisations.  On the day following the earthquake, we pledged &euro;2m to support the initial emergency relief effort. To date, &euro;300,000 each has already been disbursed to the World Food Programme and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) which is coordinating the international relief effort. A further &euro;250,000 was paid out to the Red Cross.</P>
        <P>The Government also freighted 84 tonnes of essential shelter, water and sanitation equipment to Haiti from our emergency stockpiles. These arrived on 21 January and were distributed by Concern and Goal. Yesterday I announced a further shipment of 40 tonnes at the recommendation of an Irish Aid technical team which travelled to Haiti in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. This team was tasked with assessing the humanitarian situation in Haiti and recommending how Ireland should focus its contribution to the international relief effort. It identified a continued urgent need for emergency shelter and water supplies and this second shipment will help to address these needs.</P>
        <P>In addition to these contributions, two members of the Irish Aid Rapid Response Corps have deployed to Haiti. The two concerned, an IT expert and an electrical engineer, have been assigned to the World Food Programme. Others, with skills in areas such as logistics, water and sanitation and child protection, are on stand-by. The Rapid Response Corps is a 130-strong group of highly-specialised volunteers available at short notice to humanitarian organisations in need of their skills. It was established following the 2004 tsunami.</P>
        <P>The total value of the Government response both financially and in kind is more than &euro;3 million. It is likely that this will increase further once we have a clearer and more comprehensive picture of Haiti&rsquo;s needs.  Our funding forms part of a &euro;122 million humanitarian response by the European Union, agreed at an emergency meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended last week. At that meeting the European Commission also pledged &euro;300 million for the longer term reconstruction of Haiti in advance of an international donor meeting planned for the spring. Ireland will consider its role in reconstruction in the light of the report of our technical team and a thorough assessment of Haiti&rsquo;s medium and long term needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the reports to which the Deputy refers. There are widespread allegations relating to North Korea&rsquo;s financial arrangements abroad and to possible money-laundering activities. The allegations made in these reports are even more regrettable in the context of the plight of ordinary people in North <Col N="232"/>Korea. While the North Korean regime continues to invest precious resources in its nuclear and military programmes, and in the welfare of its elites, the country is suffering chronic food insecurity and high malnutrition rates, and remains reliant on external food assistance to meet the needs of its 23 million people. </P>
        <P>Violations of human rights in North Korea are also well-documented. In his report of 22 October last, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in North Korea, Prof. Vitit Muntarbhorn, described the human rights situation there as &ldquo;abysmal&rdquo;.    He noted that despite various formal guarantees in the Constitution, the people of the DPRK are subject to persecution, clampdowns, collective punishment, torture, arbitrary executions and public executions and he added that almost 9 million people in the DPRK are suffering from food shortages.  I take these human rights violations very seriously. Issues relating to human rights are raised bilaterally with the North Korean authorities by our Ambassador in Seoul, who is accredited to North Korea, during his regular visits to the North. They have also been raised by visiting senior officials from my Department.</P>
        <P>North Korea broke off the Human Rights Dialogue which the EU initiated with it some years ago. EU meetings of a more general nature continue to take place, however, and human rights concerns are raised in this context. The most recent such meeting, at senior official level, took place during an EU Troika visit to Pyongyang from 26-30 October last.</P>
        <P>On 7 December North Korea was subject to a Universal Periodic Review (UPR) by the Human Rights Council. A wide range of issues regarding human rights abuses were raised. In its contribution to the UPR, the Irish delegation raised a number of specific human rights issues directly with the DPRK authorities, including those relating to the right to a fair trial and freedom of religion. We noted the widely-shared alarm, across the international community and from all regions, at the extent of human suffering caused by the violations of human rights in DPRK and we called again on the authorities there to work with the Special Rapporteur. Unfortunately, North Korea has consistently refused to recognise or co-operate in any way with the Special Rapporteur or with any other human rights investigations.</P>
        <P>As regards the issue of money laundering and concealment of funds in foreign bank accounts, this issue was much highlighted previously in the context of Macau. Action has been taken internationally to address illegal money-laundering and we will continue to monitor whether additional regulation is required in this regard.  At the EU level, the EU Council&rsquo;s 3rd Money Laundering Directive requires financial institutions and certain other persons, such as lawyers and accountants, to identify their customers (including beneficial owners) and to report suspicions of money laundering to the national authorities . This Directive&rsquo;s provisions apply to all EU Member States, including Luxembourg.</P>

	<P>As I stated previously in my reply of 19 January, I am aware of the case of Dr. Sadok Shourou, who was re-arrested on 3 December 2008, shortly after serving nearly 18 years of a 30 year sentence for his leadership of an Islamist group allegedly attempting to overthrow the Tunisian government.  I understand that Dr. Shou<Col N="233"/>rou was arrested for the second time on foot of comments he had made publicly and to the media about his earlier detention.  He had also urged legalisation of the an-Nahdha political movement, of which he is the former president.  The Tunisian authorities banned the an-Nahdha Party in 1991 on the grounds that they viewed it as an extremist organisation. </P>
        <P>Dr. Shourou was sentenced on 13 December 2008 to a further year in prison on charges of resuming his political activities and speaking on behalf of a banned movement. His appeal in March 2009 was denied. Reports indicate that he remains in custody.  I understand that there are concerns about his health, given the duration of his earlier period in detention and that he is now 62 years of age.  Dr Shourou&rsquo;s case has been raised at UN level by a number of NGOs, including in the context of the Universal Periodic Review of Tunisia at the UN Human Rights Council in April 2008.  It is possible that this contributed to Dr. Shourou&rsquo;s release later that year.</P>
        <P>The UN Special Rapporteur on the question of torture has expressed some concerns and has requested a visit to Tunisia on a number of occasions since 1998.  I note that the recommendations arising from the Universal Periodic Review, which were supported by Tunisia, include a recommendation that Tunisia consider cooperation with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture.  I would hope that such cooperation on the part of the Tunisian authorities would be forthcoming.</P>
        <P>The issue of freedom of expression and human rights generally in Tunisia is an important one and is subject to regular consideration at EU level.  The EU has supported measures by the Tunisian authorities to promote pluralism, democracy and freedom of expression and of association.  The EU also has a regular dialogue with Tunisia on human rights within the framework of the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement.  Regrettably, the latest meeting of the sub-committee on human rights and democracy, which should have taken place under the Swedish Presidency, had to be postponed, at Tunisia&rsquo;s request.  I hope that it will be re-arranged during the current Presidency.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department does not engage in significant capital expenditure in the State.  Most of the relatively small amount of capital expenditure undertaken by my Department is on the renovation or purchase of properties, both in Ireland and abroad.  In Ireland in 2010, there is one renovation project being undertaken where an additional floor of the Passport office building in Molesworth Street will be remodelled.  This project is currently at tender and works are expected to be completed in the spring. Throughout our diplomatic network of 75 Missions overseas, there are three new capital projects planned for 2010 which will be tendered locally.  These are the refurbishments of the Chancery in Paris and the Ambassador&rsquo;s Residences in Abuja and Ljubljana.  An additional three capital projects are ongoing and are expected to be completed in 2010; the refurbishments of the Chancery in Addis Ababa and the Ambassador&rsquo;s <Col N="234"/>Residences in Ottawa and Prague.  There are no instances of capital projects which have gone to tender that were due to start in 2010 but are not now proceeding. </P>

	<P>I refer to my response to PQ no 1221/10 on the issue of Irish investors who are experiencing difficulties with their investments in Turkish property.  I am aware of a number of similar cases to the one outlined and in this regard I recently wrote to my counterpart, the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, to raise my concerns regarding the problems experienced by Irish citizens with their property purchases in Turkey.  The Irish Embassy in Ankara has also been in contact with the Turkish authorities and an officer in the Turkish Ministry of Finance has been designated as a contact point for Irish nationals experiencing difficulties regarding their property investments.  I have asked the Embassy in Ankara to pass the details of this case to this Turkish officer.  They will also raise it with the local authorities of the area in question.  This case, in common with most cases that have been brought to my attention, relates to an Irish purchaser finding it difficult to claim their title deeds. I note that this Irish citizen is following legal advice and has decided to pursue the matters through the courts.  The Embassy in Ankara will continue to assist Irish investors in any way open to it, including in finding suitable legal representation.</P>

	<P>The Administrative Budget available to my Department in 2010 is some &euro;10million less than in 2009.  Some of the necessary savings will fall on headquarters activities but savings and efficiencies in running our embassies and consular offices will also be implemented in 2010.  The details of the reductions are currently being worked through but there will be reductions in all areas of expenditure to take account of the reduced resources.  As far as possible these will be achieved without affecting our service to the public.  In addition to these general reductions, I have decided, on a trial basis, to make structural changes with regard to some of our embassies in the European Union.  I intend to put in place in a number of capitals a lighter model of representation.  Such missions will be staffed by a single Irish diplomat with appropriate local support and backup from Dublin and other missions in the region.  They will generally operate from a more modest residence and without an official car.  They will be explicitly tasked to prioritise our work on EU affairs and the promotion of our economic interests.  There are particular challenges in implementing such a model.  Irish embassies are already relatively small in comparison to many other countries and it remains to be seen if a one-person mission is entirely feasible.  The performance of these lighter missions will be closely monitored in that regard to see if the desired outcomes can be achieved. </P>

	<P>There are a number of different schemes operating in my department which administer grant funding: the Reconciliation Fund for North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation; the Anti-Sectarianism Fund; the Emigrant Support Programme; the Communicating Europe Initiative; and the Irish Aid programme, Ireland&rsquo;s programme of official development assistance.  In addition to this there are a number of grants which are given to specific programmes or organisations such as the Atlantic Corridor Project; the Irish College in Paris; the Fulbright Commission. </P>
       <P el="10"><i>Reconciliation Fund for North-South &amp; Anglo-Irish Co-operation &amp; Anti-Sectarianism Fund</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of the Reconciliation Fund for North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation is to assist organisations involved in reconciliation work and to support efforts to create better understanding between people on the island of Ireland, as well as between Ireland and Britain.  In addition, an Anti-Sectarianism Fund was launched in February 2008, to assist local efforts aimed at tackling sectarianism.  This Fund supports community based projects that focus on developing new and more effective ways of addressing sectarianism and division in society.  The grant budget for 2009 was &euro;3 million, covering both the Reconciliation Fund and the Anti-Sectarianism Fund, which was disbursed to 147 groups last year.  Details of the grants announced in 2009, are set out below.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Emigrant Support Programme</i></P>
        <P el="0">Under the Emigrant Support Programme in 2009, grants totalling &euro;14,885,680 were provided to Irish community organisations abroad and in particular to organisations which support vulnerable members of those communities.  The table below summarises the regions and organisations to which the funds were allocated.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Promoting Ireland Abroad Grants</i></P>
        <P el="0">Under the Cultural budget of the Department funding is provided in the form of annual grants to two bodies under the aegis of the Department. The first of these is the Fulbright Commission which supports study, research, teaching and other educational activities between Ireland and the United States.  The Fulbright Commission received funding of &euro;254,000 for 2009.  The second is the Irish Cultural Centre in the Irish College in Paris, which promotes cultural and educational exchange between France and Ireland, received a grant of &euro;150,000 in 2009. A grant of &euro;250,000 was given to the Atlantic Corridor Ireland in 2009.  Atlantic Corridor Ireland facilitates the development of projects that will assist in supporting sustainable development and enhanced educational attainment, through its network activities and international linkages between economically deprived regions of Ireland, the United States and Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Communicating Europe</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Communicating Europe Initiative (CEI) was established in 1995 to raise awareness about the European Union and to improve the quality and accessibility of public information on European issues. A call for proposals issues on an annual basis.  In March of this year the Minister approved funding of &euro;292,372 for 42 projects.  A list of the groups funded in 2009 is set out below.  A press release did not issue on the occasion of the announcement of the grants.</P><Col N="236"/>
        <P el="10"><i>Title V of the Treaty on European Union Grants</i></P>
        <P el="0">Title V of the Treaty on European Union constitutes the provisions on the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of the European Union.  Expenditure under this Subhead includes, mandatory contributions under the ESDP (the EU Satellite Centre and EU Institute for Security Studies), and (ii) discretionary funding of activities in support of Ireland&rsquo;s CFSP objectives.  A list of grants made under this funding scheme is listed below.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Irish Aid</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Government provided a total of &euro;696 million for Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 2009.  Of this, &euro;571 million was administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, which manages the Government&rsquo;s development aid programme.  Under Vote 29 (International Cooperation), Irish Aid, which is based in the Development Cooperation Division of the Department, provides funding to a wide range of partners, including developing country governments and local authorities, UN Agencies, development Non-Governmental Organisations, missionaries and other civil society groups.  This funding is provided through the various funding schemes managed by the aid programme.  The clear focus of the programme, and funding allocations, is the alleviation of poverty, with a particular concentration on meeting fundamental needs, including food security, access to safe water, primary health care and access to a basic education.  Approximately 95% of the overall funding allocated to Vote 29 is managed through Grant or Grants in Aid funding schemes.  The balance is allocated to meet the costs associated with the management, oversight and administration of the aid programme.

        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the reason a passport has not been returned to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15 who mislaid their passport and applied for a duplicate, subsequently found their passport which was then cancelled due to earlier report; if renewal of passport will be undertaken in view of the need for study and employment purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As indicated in my reply to your question number 94019, on Thursday 17th December, 2009, the person in question submitted his application for a passport having lost his first Irish passport and the vital documents which provide evidence of his citizenship.  Section 7 of the Passports Act 2008 requires that before issuing a passport to a person, the Minister shall be satisfied that the person is an Irish citizen, and as to the identity of the person.  Additional information was sought from the applicant.  Having examined that information the Passport Office is now satisfied as to the identity of the applicant and his entitlement to a passport.  The applicant has been contacted and his passport has now been issued.</P>

        <Quest> the level of financial <Col N="243"/>assistance available to a family who wish to repatriate a member of their family (details supplied) who was seriously injured in the United States; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset, I wish to advise the Deputy that I am informed that Consular assistance was not sought from my Department, either through the Consular Assistance Section in Dublin or our Consulate in Boston by the person, or his family, mentioned by the Deputy.  Our Missions overseas provide a wide range of practical assistance where Irish citizens experience serious illness or are hospitalized.  This includes the provision of lists of English speaking doctors and appropriate local medical facilities; communicating with medical personnel or hospital authorities; visiting hospitals and transferring funds from family and friends.  They also liaise with insurance or medical evacuation companies.  There is a limited amount of funding available (&euro;79,000 p.a.) in the emergency repatriation fund.  Applicants for financial support are examined on an individual basis but where support is given it is usually to Irish citizens who urgently need to return home and have insufficient funds to do so.  Advances are normally repayable.  In the case of long term hospital patients, arrangements are normally made between the hospitals concerned and the HSE. </P>

	<P>In the reply to Question No. 231 of 1 December 2009, the Deputy was referred to relevant and easily-accessible published data in the Department&rsquo;s annual reports and the annual estimates for the Department which show the overall staffing numbers, grade breakdown and total payroll costs at year end.  This information is provided in these publications specifically in order to meet requests from public representatives and the wider public for such data and is available both on the Department&rsquo;s website www.dast.gov.ie and in the D&aacute;il Library.  In order to be helpful to the Deputy, the following table has been compiled and sets out a breakdown of staff numbers by grade at the end of each of the years since the Department was established.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It was not possible in the time provided to give any reasonably accurate or meaningful average wage cost for the grades of staff employed in the Department over the period from mid 2002 to 2008 given the format in which the relevant information is retained.  In addition during that period, the Department included the National Museum of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland until they were established as separate legal entities in May 2005, both of which employ a significant number of professional and technical grades.  Also due to the decentralisation of the Department to Killarney there was a turnover of staff for the years 2006 to 2009 in excess of 90%.  In light of all these factors any effort to compute average wage costs based on data retained would involve a disproportionate amount of staff resources in what would likely give a less than satisfactory result.  The relevant pay scales for Civil Service grades and key professional grades are already a matter for public record.</P>

	<P>Given its primary role of policy making and administration, the Department (including the National Archives) does not have capital projects planned or underway in the current year.  In respect of some of the agencies under the remit of the Department, major capital projects, the day-to-day responsibility for which remains with those agencies, are continuing apace, including the development of a National Conference Centre, the development of a new stadium at Lansdowne Road and the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall.  In addition, under the ACCESS, Sports Capital, Local Authority Swimming Pool and Tourism Product Development Programmes a provision of over &euro;93 million has been made in the Capital Estimates for the Department for 2010 to meet the cost of ongoing projects across the Arts/Culture, Sport and Tourism sectors.  The responsibility for the delivery of these projects rests with the groups/agencies both voluntary and statutory which have been allocated funds under the various programmes.  These programmes are of crucial importance in the provision of facilities and in retaining persons in employment. </P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s capital allocation for 2010, as shown in the Estimates announced on Budget Day, is &euro;105m.  I regard this as very important for the achievement of specific outputs and also in terms of the stimulation of economic activity at a local level across the country. The capital allocation is distributed across my Department&rsquo;s Vote as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;9.150m for Developing Communities,</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;3m for the Drugs Initiative,</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Expenditure on the various Departmental programmes and schemes under the above headings is disbursed mainly through agencies, intermediaries and other bodies rather than directly by my Department.  The chief exception to this is the allocation for islands infrastructure, where it is expected that &euro;11m will be spent this year, mainly in respect of capital projects that are already underway (the largest being the Cill R&oacute;n&aacute;in harbour works on Inis M&oacute;r, &Aacute;rainn).</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 417 and 418 together.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is responsible for the delivery of Axes 3 &amp; 4 of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 for which funding of the order of &euro;425m is available.  The roll-out of these axes commenced in February 2009 and by the end of December 2009, more than &euro;18m had been spent.  The allocation under the Programme for 2010 of &euro;40m represents an increase of approximately 120% on the level of expenditure in 2009.  Future allocations will be subject to the normal budgetary processes and will be agreed with the Department of Finance on an annual basis.  I have no doubt, however, that we will achieve the full target of &euro;425m over the lifetime of the Programme.  The main objectives of the Programme are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy.  The individual measures under the Programme including initiative allocations are listed as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Diversification into non-agricultural activities for farm families<b> &mdash; </b>&euro;16.66m;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">A number of Local Action Groups (LAGs), formerly known as LEADER companies, have been contracted by my Department to deliver the Programme throughout Ireland.  The following table details the group names, their county coverage and their overall funding allocations to date.</P>
        <P>In terms of the delivery of the Programme, my Department has issued a set of operating rules to each group based on the EU Regulations which govern it.  These rules are regularly updated, as necessary.  However, in line with the bottom-up nature of the LEADER approach, the Deputy should note that the LAG is the principle decision-maker in relation to the eligibility criteria for Programme funding, the application process and the allocation of project funding to individual applicants.  Funding decisions are made by the LAG following extensive evaluation and approval processes in the context of the Group&rsquo;s Local Development Strategy and in line with the operating rules and EU Regulations.  Groups or individuals interested in applying for funding under the Programme should, therefore, contact their local LAG for further information.</P>

	<P>The provisions and procedures governing the registration of deaths in Ireland are contained in Part 5 of the Civil Registration Act 2004. </P>
        <P>Where a death occurs in the State it is the duty of a qualified informant (normally a relative of the deceased) to attend at a registrar&rsquo;s office and register the death on foot of a certificate of cause of death supplied by a registered medical practitioner.  Where a death is referred to a coroner, the death is registered by a registrar on foot of a coroner&rsquo;s certificate.</P>
        <P>In general, only deaths which occur within the State are registerable.  Exceptions apply under the provisions of section 39 of the Act, concerning;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />deaths of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Permanent Defence Force or of the spouse or specified members of the family of such a member outside the State while the member is serving outside the State as such member,</P><Col N="249"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />deaths of persons on board an Irish aircraft or an Irish ship,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />deaths of Irish citizens on board a foreign ship or a foreign aircraft travelling to or from a port, or an airport, as the case may be, in the State.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Where the death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State occurs abroad, the death may be registered here if at the time of the death there was not a system of registration of deaths in the place where the death occurred, or such a system that applied to such a death, or it is not possible to obtain copies of or extracts from civil records of the death.  Where an Irish citizen dies abroad and the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred, a certified copy of the death registration, translated, if necessary, is sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes here and there is no necessity for the event to be entered in the register of deaths in the State.  Accordingly, it is not proposed to make any changes to the existing provisions at this time.</P>

        <Quest> if small business owners who go out of business are eligible to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit; if not, her plans to change this so that a safety net is provided to these risk takers who provide employment here; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The PRSI system, in line with other European social protection systems, provides for separate arrangements for employed and self employed workers. </P>
        <P>Self-employed people pay a modified rate of PRSI contribution (Class S) which provides cover for long-term pensions such as state pension and widow&rsquo;s/widower&rsquo;s contributory pension.  These contributions do not provide cover for short-term benefits such as jobseeker&rsquo;s and illness benefits &mdash; these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P.  This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed people pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these same people enjoy.</P>
        <P>The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work.  This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable.  Self-employed workers are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3%.  They are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.</P>
        <P>In certain cases, a self-employed person who had insurable employment in the relevant year (currently 2008) and has sufficient PRSI contribution paid at the appropriate class, may qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment provided all the conditions of the scheme are satisfied.</P>
        <P>A self-employed person who has insufficient PRSI contributions paid may qualify for a jobseekers allowance which is a means tested payment.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers.  Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context.  Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The Executive has advised that the person concerned was initially awarded a mortgage interest supplement based on the interest paid on his original loan of &euro;68,000 which related to his primary residence.  The Executive has further advised that as the person concerned was dissatisfied with the rate of payment awarded in this case, he appealed this decision to the Executive&rsquo;s designated Appeals Officer but that this appeal was unsuccessful. This decision was appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) which awarded a mortgage interest supplement based on a mortgage valued at &euro;136,000.</P>
        <P>The Executive advised that as a result of the Social Welfare Appeals Office decision, the mortgage interest supplement payment increased from &euro;36 to &euro;61 per week.  The Executive has now advised that, following a further review of his entitlement, payment of mortgage interest supplement will be reduced to &euro;22 per week from 1 February 2010.  The reduction in mortgage interest supplement payable is due to the reduction in the amount of interest payable by the person concerned in respect of his loan.</P>
        <P>The Executive further advised that the person concerned was notified of the decision to reduce the rate of payment of mortgage interest supplement in October 2009.  It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision to the Executive&rsquo;s designated Appeals Officer.</P>

	<P>Any person who makes a claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, domiciliary care allowance, child benefit, one parent family payment, disability allowance, State pension non-contributory, carer&rsquo;s allowance, widow&rsquo;s non-contributory, guardian&rsquo;s non-contributory payment, blind pension or supplementary welfare allowance must be habitually resident in the State. </P>
        <P>Section 15 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2009, passed by this House on 15 December 2009, provided for an amendment to the habitual residence provisions to ensure that only those who have a legal right to reside in the State shall be regarded as habitually resident for the purposes of any claim for social welfare.  This amendment states that a person who is awaiting a decision on their application for leave to remain shall not be regarded as habitually resident.  It also states that a determination as to whether a person satisfies the habitual residence condition from the date of grant of leave to remain shall be determined in accordance with all the circumstances of the case, including in particular:</P>
<P el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country; </P>
<P el="5">(b) <?oasys _ix ?>the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</P>
<P el="5">(c) <?oasys _ix ?>the nature and pattern of the person&rsquo;s employment;</P><Col N="251"/>
<P el="5">(d) <?oasys _ix ?>the person&rsquo;s main centre of interest, and</P>
<P el="5">(e) <?oasys _ix ?>the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In the experience of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, it has been found that in most cases of persons who have been granted leave to remain on humanitarian grounds sufficient evidence concerning these factors is readily available to show that they satisfy the habitual residence condition.  However, cases do occur where such evidence is not immediately available to the Department and the normal investigation has to be made to determine where the person has been living during the period of their application for leave to remain, what they have been living on during this period, where their main centre of interest lies and what their future intentions are.</P>

	<P>Statistics are not maintained of the number of court orders compelling the Department to make deductions from social welfare payments for maintenance purposes.  Each order is dealt with on an individual basis. </P>
        <P>Under normal circumstances, social welfare payments cannot be reduced below the corresponding rate of supplementary welfare allowance which would be payable, based on family circumstances, without the agreement of the claimant.  However if the court orders the Department to deduct an amount of money from a person&rsquo;s social welfare payment and pay it either directly to another person or to the court office, the Department must comply with the order of the court.</P>

        <P FLI="0">However, a number of categories are specifically excluded from receiving assistance.  These are people in full-time work, people in full-time education and people involved in trade disputes.  Additionally SWA cannot at any time be viewed as a temporary or interim means of income support available independently of HRC, while an applicant awaits the outcome of either a decision &mdash; or an appeal against a decision &mdash; on a claim for a social welfare payment from the Department.</P>
        <P>The HRC guideline advises that the main factors to be considered in determining whether a person is habitually resident are as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Length and continuity of residence in Ireland or in any other particular country</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Length and purpose of any absence from Ireland</P>

(These have been included in section 246 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 as amended by section 30 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007). The person concerned was refused SWA on 23 September 2009 as she was not deemed to be habitually resident in the state on the basis of the examination of her claim taking these factors into account.  The HSE has advised that the person concerned appealed against the decision to refuse her SWA to the HSE Appeals Officer.  The HSE Appeals Officer upheld the decision in December 2009 to refuse SWA and the person concerned was advised of her right to Appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  She lodged an appeal with the SWAO in December 2009.  The person concerned will be advised of the outcome as soon as a decision has been given in this case.  In the meantime, SWA is not payable in this case.</P>

	<P>In order to qualify for Domiciliary Care Allowance a child must have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</P>
        <P>An application for Domiciliary Care Allowance was received by the Department on 9 th July 2009.  This application was referred to one of the Departments Medical Assessors who found that the child in question did not meet the medical criteria to be eligible for Domiciliary Care Allowance.</P>
        <P>A letter issued to the person in question on 2nd September 2009 where she was advised of the decision to refuse Domiciliary Care Allowance for not satisfying the medical criteria.  In the case of an application which is refused on medical grounds, the applicant may submit additional information and/or ask for the case to be reviewed by a different Medical Assessor specially designated for this task. Where a person is not satisfied with the decision of a Deciding Officer they may appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  There has been no appeal of the decision or request for a review received in the Department to date.</P>

	<P>Spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors.  In these cases both spouses are liable to pay PRSI (Class S) contributions in a timely manner.</P>
        <P>On foot of a Programme for Government commitment an information leaflet, <i>&lsquo;Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements&rsquo;</i>, has been <Col N="259"/>developed between the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business.  It was published on the 25th of June, 2008.  The leaflet clarifies that spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria.  In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI and build up entitlement towards a contributory state pension and other social welfare benefits.  It is open to a person to apply for recognition of a commercial partnership, at any time.  The qualifying conditions for State Pension (Contributory) require the applicant to:- have entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 56 years; &mdash; have at least 260 paid contribution weeks since entry into insurance; &mdash; satisfy the yearly average condition.</P>
        <P>In addition, Section 110 (1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 provides that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions unless: (a) the person has paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year before attaining pensionable age, and (b) all self-employment contributions payable by him or her have been paid.</P>
        <P>According to the records of this Department, the self-employment contributions were all paid by the person concerned after their 66th birthday.  The person concerned does not therefore satisfy the condition at (a) above and has no entitlement to a State Pension (Contributory) based on her self-employment contributions.  However she has an entitlement to a State Pension (Contributory) at a reduced rate based on her standard rate PRSI contributions excluding self-employment contributions, and has been advised in writing of this entitlement on 12th January 2010.  This pension is payable at 50% of the maximum rate and is based on her yearly average of 11 contributions.  A yearly average of 48 or more is required to qualify for a full-rate State Pension (Contributory).</P>
        <P>Section 110 (1)(a) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, has been on the statute books for over fifteen years and there has not been a change in policy in relation to the requirement to have paid at least one year&rsquo;s self employment contributions prior to reaching age 66, in order to qualify for a State Pension (Contributory).</P>
        <P>An overpayment will be determined in the above case and the person concerned will be notified and requested to repay the amount involved.   However a Recovery Officer may reduce or cancel an overpayment based on the circumstances of an individual case, in line with the governing legislation.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that while the publication of the leaflet <i>&lsquo;Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements&rsquo;</i> clarified existing procedures in relation to the recognition of commercial partnerships between husbands and wives for social insurance purposes, including retrospective payment of social insurance, it did not involve a change in existing policy or administration.

PRSI Class K People receiving income which is not subject to social insurance contributions but which is liable for the Health Contribution, such as occupational pensions, income deriving <Col N="261"/>from positions of certain Office Holders (e.g. Judiciary and State Solicitors) and income of people aged 66 to 70 years who were previously liable for Class S.</P>
<P el="10"><i>PRSI Class M</i></P>
<P el="0">The M Class should be used for people with NIL contribution liability, e.g. employees under age 16 years, people within Class K with a NIL liability (medical card holders, widows/widowers, people aged 70 years or over), etc.</P>

	<P>Under Section 201 of the 2005 Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE) may make a single payment to meet an exceptional need to people on social welfare or health board payments.  These payments are known as Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs) and are made to assist with any essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet from his/her own resources.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case. </P>
        <P>The person concerned was refused an ENP in November 2009 as in the opinion of the CWO the person concerned did not have an exceptional need at the time of the application.  The person concerned was advised of her right to appeal the decision to the designated Appeals Office of the HSE.  To date no appeal has been received.  The person concerned should contact the local HSE Appeals Office, 8 O&rsquo;Connell Street, Clonmel, Co.Tipperary. (phone: 052-6125758) should she wish to appeal the original decision to refuse an ENP.</P>

	<P>It is understood that this Question relates to the treatment of cohabiting couples in the social welfare and tax systems. </P>
        <P>These systems have evolved over time and in response to a variety of factors, including Constitutional imperatives as interpreted by the Courts, changing social trends and EU Directives.</P>
        <P>The social welfare code recognises the couple status of co-habiting couples and treats married and co-habiting couples in a similar manner.  The EEC Equality Directive 79/9 and the subsequent Supreme Court case (<i>Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare, 1989</i>) led to the change in the treatment of non-married cohabiting couples in the social welfare code.  The Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</P>
        <P>The income tax arrangements and subsequent legislation for cohabiting couples are a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>Based on the information available in March 2009 in the Central Unit dealing with habitual residency cases, the number of Irish people refused for failure to meet the habitual residency requirements was 424. </P>
        <P>In addition to the decisions made in the central unit and the other payment areas, the figure of 985 which was provided in response to the question on 19th January is an accurate reflection of the number of decisions made in offices throughout the Department.  This figure took account of cases dealt with in the Central Decisions Unit and in the HQ payment areas in Sligo, Letterkenny and Longford. It subsequently emerged, however, that a number of other cases had been decided locally and these cases had not been reported centrally.</P>

	<P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment. Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.</P>

	<P>My Department encourages people to engage in voluntary work within the State. Any person who engages in voluntary work may continue to be entitled to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or Allowance provided that, in engaging in the voluntary work, the customer continues to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  Examples of voluntary work in which jobseeker&rsquo;s may engage include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />helping the sick, elderly or persons with a disability</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />assisting youth clubs, church groups, sports groups, cultural organisations, local resident associations</P>
        <P FLI="0">The groups involved may be nationally organised groups or local voluntary or community groups.</P>
        <P>The aim of the Voluntary Work Option is twofold, namely &mdash; to encourage voluntary organisations to involve jobseeker&rsquo;s to the greatest extent possible in their existing activities by creating new opportunities for voluntary work and to inform jobseeker&rsquo;s of their freedom to <Col N="267"/>involve themselves in voluntary work and to encourage them to do so. In addition, the existing Community Employment Scheme, operated by F&Aacute;S, offers the opportunity to unemployed persons to participate in paid employment in the social economy.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation governing means-tests for Disability Allowance and other welfare schemes provides that certain compensation awards are disregarded in the assessment of means. For instance, compensation awards by the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal 1997, the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal 2002 or compensation awards by a court   of competent jurisdiction to persons who have contracted Hepatitis C or HIV from contaminated blood products, together with subsequent income from the investment of that money, are not assessed as means. Similarly, compensation awards to persons who have a disability caused by Thalidomide together with subsequent income from the investment of that money are disregarded in the means test.</P>
        <P>More generally, compensation awards for injuries are treated as capital income. In this regard, the capital disregard in the means test for Disability Allowance was increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 in 2007. This measure recognised the need to provide additional supports for people with disabilities on low incomes by addressing the fact that in cases where a compensation award has been made to a client as a result of accident or injury, the assessment of capital received in excess of &euro;20,000 could have resulted in a reduction or loss of payment of Disability Allowance and associated benefits.</P>

        <P>Similarly, mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements have been made to the means test for rent and mortgage interest supplement in recent years. The assessment of means now provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as earnings increase. Those availing of part-time employment (less than 30 hours a week), community employment, and/or specified training opportunities can continue to receive rent or mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules. Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.</P>
        <P>A person is regarded as being in full-time employment where s/he is works for 30 hours a week or more an d in general, a person is not entitled to rent or mortgage interest supplement while engaged in remunerative full-time employment. However, where an existing rent supplement tenant has been out of full-time employment for at least 12 months and, has been accepted by a housing authority as being eligible for accommodation under the Rental Accommodation Scheme, that person may engage in full-time employment and still be considered for rent supplement, subject to their satisfying all of the other conditions of the scheme, including a means test.  Arrangements are in place to allow a person to participate in: approved employment, approved training schemes; or to engage in full-time employment and retain entitlement to mortgage interest supplement for up to 4 years on a tapered basis. If a claimant is on an approved scheme they can retain 75% of their mortgage interest supplement in year 1, 50% in year 2, and 25% in years 3 and 4. This arrangement is subject to the claimant&rsquo;s income being below an income threshold, currently &euro;317.43. Back to work allowance and family income supplements are disregarded in the assessment of household income. PRSI and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded.</P>
        <P>The Department is developing proposals in relation to the payment of rent and mortgage interest supplements to people who participate in the graduate placement scheme. These will be finalised and announced shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 456 and 457 together.</P>
        <P>Social welfare legislation does not currently provide for the reimbursement to the Department by insurance companies of social welfare payments deducted from awards of special damages in respect of loss of earnings.</P>
        <P>However, officials in the Department have been examining this matter. The Department does not routinely collect information on the numbers of clients who hold private insurance or whose loss of income was covered through an insurance claim. It is not possible, therefore, at this time to produce robust estimates of how much money might be reimbursed if the legislation in this area were changed.</P>

	<P>Spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors.  In these cases both spouses are liable to pay PRSI (Class S) contributions in a timely manner.</P>
        <P>On foot of a Programme for Government commitment an information leaflet, <i>&lsquo;Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements&rsquo;</i>, has been developed between the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business.  It was published on the 25th of June, 2008. The leaflet clarifies that spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria.  In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI and <Col N="270"/>build up entitlement towards a contributory state pension and other social welfare benefits.   It is open to a person to apply for recognition of a commercial partnership, at any time.</P>
        <P>The qualifying conditions for State Pension (Contributory) require the applicant to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 56 years</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have at least 260 paid contribution weeks since entry into insurance satisfy the yearly average condition.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, Section 110(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 provides that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions unless:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>the person has paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year before attaining pensionable age,</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">and</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(b) all self-employment contributions payable by him or her have been paid.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The person concerned was awarded a State Pension (Contributory) from 24th October 2008. However, according to the records of this Department, the self-employment contributions were all paid by the person concerned after their 66th birthday.  The person concerned does not therefore satisfy the condition at (a) above and has no entitlement to a State Pension (Contributory) based on their self-employment contributions and should not have been put into payment on this scheme. The person has been notified of this decision on the 12th January 2010, and has been advised in relation to their right to appeal this decision, or to have it reviewed.</P>
        <P>Section 110(1)(a) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, has been on the statute books for over fifteen years and there has not been a change in policy in relation to the requirement to have paid at least one year&rsquo;s self employment contributions prior to reaching age 66, in order to qualify for a State Pension (Contributory).</P>
        <P>An overpayment will be determined in the above case and the person concerned will be notified and requested to repay the amount involved.   However a Recovery Officer may reduce or cancel an overpayment based on the circumstances of an individual case, in line with governing legislation.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that while the publication of the leaflet <i>&lsquo;Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements&rsquo;</i> clarified existing procedures in relation to the recognition of commercial partnerships between husbands and wives for social insurance purposes, including retrospective payment of social insurance, it did not involve a change in existing policy or administration.  In particular, the clarification of the position did not alter people&rsquo;s potential entitlements and all applicants for the state pension (contributory) must continue to satisfy the eligibility conditions as contained in legislation, and outlined above.</P>
        <P>The Department understands and apologises for the upset and distress caused to this person and regrets the administrative error involved.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the reason persons on reduced rate social assistance payments have received a full decrease in their payment for 2010 and not a decrease proportionate to their reduced rate payment. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The various social assistance schemes operated by my Department are means tested and include schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and one-parent family payment. For means test purposes, account is taken of the value of any capital or property owned by the person in addition to any cash income the person might have including, <i>inter alia</i>, earnings from employment, income from self-employment, foreign social security pensions and occupational pensions. If a person has a spouse or a partner, the means of that person is also taken into account. </P>
        <P>As provided for in social welfare legislation, where a person has means the weekly value of those means is deducted from the maximum weekly rate of payment and a reduced rate is payable. Where a person has weekly means in excess of the maximum personal rate of the relevant social assistance payment, no payment is made.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the means test is to reflect that fact that the person has other income or assets available to support him or her. Accordingly, the total weekly income available to that person or couple comprises both the value of the means of the person in addition to any social assistance payment they may be entitled to.</P>
        <P>In addition, where a person has income from certain sources, some of that income is disregarded. In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, for example, the first &euro;20 per day is disregarded, subject to a maximum of &euro;60 per week and 60% of the balance is assessed where a claimant or a spouse/partner has income from employment,</P>
        <P>Where a person has no means, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is payable at the maximum rate of payment. In the case of a single person, the maximum weekly rate was &euro;204.30 in 2009 and is &euro;196 in 2010, a reduction of &euro;8.30 per week or 4.1%. In the case of a couple with no means, the reduction is &euro;13.80 per week, also 4.1%, from &euro;339.80 to &euro;326.10 (including the qualified adult allowance).</P>
        <P>The effect of the Budget changes in rates of payment where a person has means can be illustrated by way of the following example. In the case of a couple where the claimant is unemployed and the spouse or partner is working three days per week with net earnings of &euro;460 per week, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance of &euro;99.90 per week would have been payable in 2009. This reduced rate is equivalent to the combined maximum weekly personal and qualified adult <Col N="272"/>rates of &euro;339.90 less weekly means of &euro;240. Accordingly, the total income of the couple in this example would have been &euro;559.90 per week in 2009 comprising net earnings of &euro;460 and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance of &euro;99.90.</P>
        <P>Consequent on the reduction in the maximum weekly personal and qualified adult rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance announced in Budget 2010, the total weekly income of the couple will reduce to &euro;546.10 per week in 2010, an overall reduction of &euro;13.80 per week or 2.5%.</P>
        <P>As the example shows, the overall reduction in percentage terms in total family income for persons on reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is somewhat less than applies in the case of a person with no means who receives the maximum rate of payment. This arises because the element of their total income which is represented by their means is not affected by the recent Budget. The introduction of pro-rata reductions for recipients of reduced rate jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments would further reduce the overall percentage loss in total family income when compared with that experienced by persons who had no means and are, accordingly, totally dependent on the social welfare payment.</P>
        <P>Similar effects will occur in relation to other social assistance payments. The precise level of reduction in overall family income will vary as the income disregards and assessment rates vary from scheme to scheme. No change was made in Budget 2010 in relation to the means testing arrangements where a claimant or a spouse/partner is engaged in employment in order to maintain incentives to take up, or remain in, employment.</P>
        <P>Where a claimant, or his or her spouse, is in employment and net earnings from that employment reduce for one reason or another, the claimant should request his or her Social Welfare Local Office, or the relevant Department Headquarters Office dealing with the claim, to review their means. In the event of a reduction in means, the level of entitlement will increase.</P>

	<P>Spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors. In these cases, both spouses are liable to pay PRSI (Class S) contributions in a timely manner.</P>
        <P>On foot of a Programme for Government commitment an information leaflet, <i>&lsquo;Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements&rsquo;</i> has been developed between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business.  It was published on 25 June, 2008.  The leaflet clarifies that spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria.  In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI and build up entitlement towards a contributory state pension and other social welfare benefits.   It is open to any person to apply for recognition of a commercial partnership.</P>
        <P>Approximately 1,000 people applied for partnership under the scheme by showing that they were in partnership with their spouses.  Of these, 579 cases have been decided on the basis of whether or not they qualify as a partnership.  Some 508 of those were deemed to have a partnership in existence.  Of those, 268 applied for a State Pension (Contributory). One condition for receiving State Pension (Contributory) is that the person must have paid one years contri<Col N="274"/>butions before reaching pension age. Unfortunately a number of claimants who failed to meet this condition were authorised for payment of the pension. When their cases were reviewed the error was discovered and revised decision was made disallowing the claim. To date 85 claims for State Pension (Contributory) which were in payment have been disallowed and 16 customers have had their rates reduced. A further 46 customers have failed to satisfy the qualifying conditions State Pension (Contributory) and accordingly their claims have been refused.</P>
        <P>The qualifying conditions for State Pension (Contributory) require the applicant to have entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 56 years; have at least 260 paid contribution weeks since entry into insurance; satisfy the yearly average condition.</P>
        <P>In addition, Section 110(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 provides that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions unless (a) the person has paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year before attaining pensionable age, and (b) all self-employment contributions payable by him or her have been paid.</P>
        <P>It is open to any person to apply for recognition of a commercial partnership.  However, to be eligible for State Pension, the legislation stipulates that at least 52 self-employment contributions must be paid by a person before they reach 66 years of age. Contributions paid by a pension applicant&rsquo;s spouse do not satisfy this condition.</P>
        <P>Overpayments will be determined in these cases. The persons concerned will be notified and requested to repay the amount involved.  However a Recovery Officer may reduce or cancel an overpayment based on the circumstances of an individual case, in line with governing legislation.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that while the publication of the leaflet <i>&ldquo;Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements&rdquo;</i> clarified existing procedures in relation to the recognition of commercial partnerships between husbands and wives for social insurance purposes, including retrospective payment of social insurance, it did not involve a change in existing policy or administration.

	<P>Spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors. In these cases, both spouses are liable to pay PRSI (Class S) contributions in a timely manner. In addition, to qualify for a State Pension (Contributory), at least one year&rsquo;s contributions must be paid before reaching pension age.</P>
        <P>On foot of a Programme for Government commitment an information leaflet, <i>&lsquo;Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements&rsquo;</i>, has been developed between the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the Revenue Commis<Col N="275"/>sioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business.  It was published on the 25th of June, 2008. The leaflet clarifies that spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria.  In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI and build up entitlement towards a contributory state pension and other social welfare benefits.   It is open to any person to apply for recognition of a commercial partnership.</P>
        <P>The qualifying conditions for State Pension (Contributory) require the applicant to have entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 56 years; have at least 260 paid contribution weeks since entry into insurance; satisfy the yearly average condition.</P>
        <P>In addition, Section 110(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 provides that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions unless (a)  the person has paid self-employment contributions in respect of at   least one contribution year before attaining pensionable age, and (b) all self-employment contributions payable by him or her have been paid.</P>
        <P>Section 110(1)(a) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, has been on the statute books for over fifteen years and there has not been a change in policy in relation to the requirement to have paid at least one year&rsquo;s self employment contributions prior to reaching age 66, in order to qualify for a State Pension (Contributory).</P>
        <P>Approximately 1,000 people applied for recognition of a commercial partnership with their spouses.  Of these, 579 cases have been decided on the basis of whether or not they qualify as a partnership.  Some 508 of those were deemed to have a partnership in existence.  Of these 268 have applied for a State Pension (Contributory).  However, following a review it was found that the self-employment contributions were all paid by the persons concerned after their 66th birthday.  The people concerned did not therefore satisfy the condition at (a) above and has no entitlement to a State Pension (Contributory), and should not have been put into payment under this scheme.  85 claims for State Pension (Contributory) which were in payment have been disallowed and 16 customers have had their rates reduced.  A further 46 customers have failed to satisfy the qualifying conditions for State Pension (Contributory) and accordingly their claims have been refused.</P>
        <P>Overpayments will be determined in these cases.  The persons concerned will be notified and requested to repay the amount involved.  However a Recovery Officer may reduce or cancel an overpayment based on the circumstances of an individual case, in line with governing legislation.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that while the publication of the leaflet <i>&lsquo;Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements&rsquo;</i> clarified existing procedures in relation to the recognition of commercial partnerships between husbands and wives for social insurance purposes, including retrospective payment of social insurance, it did not involve a change in existing policy or administration.  In particular, the clarification of the position did not alter people&rsquo;s potential entitlements and all applicants for the state pension (contributory) must continue to satisfy the eligibility conditions as contained in legislation, and outlined above.</P>
        <P>The Department understands and apologises for the upset and distress caused to all persons concerned and regrets the administrative error involved.</P>

	<P>In recognition of the devastation suffered by people in many areas of the country as a result of the flooding from November 2009 onwards the Government set up a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme to provide income tested financial support to people who have suffered damages to their homes not covered by insurance.  An initial sum of &euro;10 million has been set aside by the Government for this purpose. </P>
        <P>Community Welfare Service staff throughout the country have been providing support to families since this flooding occurred. Up to the 15 January 2010 they had already made over 1,861 payments to 1,091 individuals to the value of &euro;744,000. The average payment per individual is &euro;680, with the largest payment to an individual in excess of &euro;20,000.  Initially, the vast bulk of applications for humanitarian assistance were for small amounts to assist with basics such as food, clothing, bedding, heating and the hire of dehumidifiers.</P>
        <P>As the flood waters began to recede in some areas and householders were able to assess the extent of damage to the contents of their homes, claims have been submitted and approved for items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods.</P>
        <P>While assistance is available for structural repairs to homes not covered by household insurance, very few large scale claims have been made at this stage. This is because homeowners have not yet established the cost of repair in many cases, for example because they are awaiting builder&rsquo;s estimates. As the flood waters have receded in most areas, individuals are now in a better position to assess the extent of the damage to their homes. It is expected that large scale claims will be received over the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Application forms and information about the Humanitarian Assistance Fund are available from the Department of Social and Family Affairs website, <i>www.welfare.ie</i>.  This material is also available through the Citizens Information Service, and the HSE website,<i> www.HSE.ie</i>.</P>

        <P>In accordance with the Framework for Major Emergency Management, the Defence Forces in their role as aid to the civil power (an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) and aid to the civil authorities (i.e. local authorities, HSE, etc.)<b> </b>can be called upon to provide support to locally based services.</P>
        <P>During the recent period of severe weather conditions, I directed that all assets, resources and capabilities of the Defence Forces throughout the country be made available to assist the civil authorities where and when called upon.</P>
        <P>Limerick County Council were advised that the assistance of the Defence Forces was available. Neither my Department nor the Defence Forces received an official request for assistance from Limerick County Council. If such a request had been made, assistance would have been forthcoming.</P>
        <P>The provision of Defence Forces capabilities is dependent on the exigencies of the service and within available resources at the time. However, where additional forces are required in an emergency in any one particular area, the Defence Forces has the adaptability to marshal capability to meet the need.</P>

	<P>My Department is engaged on an ongoing capital building programme designed to modernise and enhance the training, operational and accommodation facilities available to members of the Defence Forces. The programme provides for new starts and the continuation of capital building projects already underway. The amount allocated in 2010 for this programme is &euro;12.8m of which &euro;7m approx. will be expended on projects already underway and the balance will be used for new starts in 2010.</P>
        <P>There are no new projects that went to tender and were due to start in 2010 which are not now proceeding.</P>
        <P>A number of capital building projects are at various stages of construction at a number of military locations. The main projects include gymnasium facilities at Aiken Barracks, Dundalk and Custume Barracks, Athlone, administration and security buildings at Finner Camp, and billet accommodation at Lynch Camp, Kilworth.</P>
        <P>The principal projects due to go to tender in 2010 are new locker room facilities at both Aiken Barracks, Dundalk and Finner Camp, upgrade of dining hall/kitchen facilities at Kilbride Camp, garaging facilities at Custume Barracks, Athlone and upgrading of the medical facilities at the Defence Forces Training Centre, Curragh Camp.</P>
        <P>While I am aware of the importance of such expenditure in the context of the economy in general, it is also imperative that my Department and the Defence Forces look to whatever efficiencies we can make, taking into account the current difficult economic environment and the overall financial envelope available for the Department for investment in new capital building projects over the coming years.</P>

	<P>On 20 December 2001, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1386 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, authorising the establishment of an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.  Ireland has participated in the NATO&ndash;led UN mandated mission since 5 July 2002, following the Government Decision of 2 July 2002, authorising the provision of seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the force.  Over the past number of years the UN is increasingly relying on regional organisations such as the European Union, African Union and NATO to launch and manage operations on its behalf and under its authority.</P>
        <P>Since 2002, the Government has reviewed and approved, on an annual basis, the continued participation by seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF.  On 30 June 2009, the Government approved continued participation by seven members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF for a further period from July 2009 subject to ongoing review by the Department of Defence.</P>
        <P>The seven Irish personnel currently participating in ISAF, comprising 4 Officers and 3 Non Commissioned Officers, are located in the two ISAF Headquarters in Kabul.  The Irish personnel work in staff appointments in planning and administrative roles.  Irish personnel are rotated every 6 months.</P>
        <P>Seven members of the Permanent Defence Force have served with the force to date in 2010. The additional cost to the Defence Vote arising out of Defence Force participation in ISAF is approximately &euro;270,000 per annum.</P>

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas, including the dates from which the Defence Forces have participated in these missions, are listed in the tabular statement below.</P><Col N="279"/>
        <P>The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed, are the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) with 419 personnel, the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 236 personnel and the EU-led operation, ALTHEA, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 44 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the EU, OSCE and NATO.</P>
        <P>The taskings for the MINURCAT mission in Chad is similar to the former EUFOR mission in Chad but MINURCAT  has two additional tasks, namely; to escort humanitarian aid convoys where and when necessary and to protect logistics distribution points and centres, including escorts. KFOR&rsquo;s mandate is to establish a safe and secure environment in Kosovo conducive to the implementation of refugee return and reconstruction. The EU-led operation, ALTHEA, in Bosnia and Herzegovina is tasked with the main peace stabilisation role under the military aspects of the General Framework for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</P>
        <P>Troops serving on the main overseas missions are rotated on a six-monthly basis except in the case of troops serving with MINURCAT in Chad who are rotated on four-monthly basis.</P>

	<P>My Department has a delegated sanction from the Department of Finance for implementation of the general moratorium on the filling of public sector posts in the Local Authority Sector, on the condition that the overall staffing levels in the local authority sector are to be reduced significantly by the end of 2010 in adherence with the Government&rsquo;s Policy on Staffing and Numbers in the Public Sector.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements which issued to the local authority sector on 20 August 2009, Local Authorities are expected, where vacancies arise, to consider options for reorganisation and reallocation of work to meet requirements. Any exceptions to this principle, which will arise in very limited circumstances, require sanction from my Department.</P>
        <P>Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible, including the employment of Planners, in compliance with the relevant public sector recruitment and employment law requirements.</P>

        <Quest> if a full water rate reimbursement scheme will be considered with local authorities for businesses in instances in which water supplies are cut off to them for more than 24 hours in view of the fact that a number of businesses have to close down when such water shortages take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Local authorities are responsible for setting water charges in their functional areas.  The Government&rsquo;s water pricing policy provides for full cost recovery without profit, with charges based on actual metered consumption. The cost of providing water services to the non-domestic sector includes elements of infrastructure provision including meter installation and operation and maintenance costs and as a result the level of water charges varies from authority to authority.</P>
        <P>A national water metering programme for purposes of supply to non domestic customers is now largely complete and the majority of non domestic users are being charged based on consumption.  Such customers will not be charged for consumption in the event of a disruption where the local authority cannot provide a metered water supply.</P>
        <P>It is matter for individual local authorities to consider offering discounts or reduced water charges for customers paying fixed charges who have been affected by recent disruptions in services.</P>

	<P>A scheme to extend the Lough Mask Regional Water Supply to Louisburgh and a scheme to extend the supply from Shrah to Westport and to upgrade the water treatment plant in Tourmakeady were included for funding in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 at estimated costs of &euro;6.3m and &euro;21.3m respectively.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently examining Mayo County Council&rsquo;s latest tender proposal, received in October 2009, to advance the extension from Shrah to Westport and to upgrade the water treatment plant at Tourmakeady.  A decision will be conveyed to the Council as soon as possible in the light of the finalisation of the Water Services Investment Programme for 2010 to 2012.</P>
        <P>My Department is awaiting the Council&rsquo;s tender proposals to advance the extension to Louisburgh.</P>
        <P>Local authorities were asked in July 2009 to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services in their areas to my Department by 23 October 2009.  My Department is currently considering these assessments, which form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 Water Services Investment Programme.  In conducting their assessments, local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.  I expect to publish the Water Services Investment Programme 2010 to 2012 early this year.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s responsibilities include capital programmes for Housing, Water Services, Environmental and Heritage Protection, Fire Services, Libraries and other capital projects <Col N="287"/>implemented primarily by local authorities but also by my Department.  The scale of these activities, involving hundreds of separate projects at varying stage of implementation primarily by local authorities, ranges across social and affordable housing, water supply and waste water treatment systems, construction and upgrading of fire stations and libraries, as well as improvement works by my Department at National Parks.</P>
        <P>I am acutely aware of the value of our key infrastructural investment programmes in terms of employment creation and maintenance, economic recovery, and social and environmental support. Expenditure provisions for 2010 for my Department are set out in the Estimates Volume published by the Minister for Finance as part of Budget 2010; these include some &euro;1.5 billion for investment in my Department&rsquo;s capital programmes.  My Department, local authorities and related agencies will work to maximize outputs from the 2010 provisions through prioritisation, increased efficiency and lower procurement costs generally.  The compilation of the detailed information sought in relation to individual projects would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work by my Department, including contact with local authorities.</P>

	<P>Having regard to available budgetary resources, priority is being given under the bog purchase scheme to those wishing to sell their interest in the 32 raised bog sites which were nominated for designation as Special Areas of Conservation in 1999. For these sites the ten year derogation given by the Government, which allowed the continuation of turf cutting for personal domestic use, has now expired.  The person in question owns land within a Natural Heritage Area designated in 2004, and the 10 year derogation period will not expire until 2014. Land transactions within this area do not qualify for priority attention at present.  Turf cutting for domestic purposes can continue on this site until 2014. However, the individual in question would lose out on the incentive bonus that is provided to those who have not cut turf on lands subject of a proposed sale to the Department. </P>

	<P>Part H of the Building Regulations (Drainage and Waste Water Disposal) sets out the requirements for the design and installation of wastewater systems.  The relevant Technical Guidance Document (TGD) H provides guidance on how to comply with the requirements of Part H.  Part H / TGD-H is currently under review and the public consultation process in this regard will end on 8 March 2010.</P>
        <P>The EPA Code of Practice on Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems serving Single Houses refers to the suite of new European Standards for small wastewater treatment plants EN 12566.  It is proposed to call up the EPA Code of Practice in TGD-H in substitution for SR:6 of 1991 which will be withdrawn by the National Standards Authority of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The renewed Programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a scheme for the licensing and inspection of septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems.  My Department is chairing a task force to consider how the inspection of septic tanks should be carried out.  In order to comply with a recent European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling, legislation will be required to give effect to the new inspection system.  At this stage, while this matter is receiving priority attention, it is too early to estimate when the new arrangements will be operational.</P>
        <P>In the interim, my Department has recently issued a circular letter to planning authorities regarding the implementation of EPA&rsquo;s new Code of Practice, and <i>inter alia</i>, requests planning authorities to continue their practice of requiring that details of on-going proprietary wastewater systems maintenance contracts with suppliers and/or expert contractors are provided as part of the planning application documentation, and that such contracts should be maintained <Col N="289"/>by the applicants, developers and/or property owners as appropriate, as a condition of any planning permission or approval.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Separate provisions apply to the exercise of planning control by a planning authority and An Bord Pleanala under Part III of the Planning and Development Act, 2000.  The raison d&rsquo;etre of the Board, as an independent planning appeals body, also suggests that it will make decisions that do not accord with those already taken by planning authorities; this does not mean that the planning authority is not properly considering the relevant factors, including its development plan policies and the provisions of relevant legislation and guidelines.</P>
        <P>An Bord Pleanala&rsquo;s Annual Report 2008 shows that the Board confirmed planning authority decisions in about one third of planning appeal cases, varied planning authority decisions in one third of cases and reversed planning authority decisions in the remaining one third of cases; while there will be variations amongst planning authorities, these proportions have generally remained constant in recent years.</P>
        <P>My Department keeps the planning code under regular review in order to ensure that it supports proper planning and sustainable development.  My Department has also issued a large number of statutory planning guidelines to promote best practice in planning authorities and consistency across planning authorities.  Copies of the guidelines are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at<i> www.environ.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the Commissioner of Valuation.  A standard Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) is applied to all such property within any local authority area and there is no provision for discounting the ARV or issuing credit notes in respect of commercial rate charges.</P>
        <P>Under section 2(1) of the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for the waiver of all or a portion of rates due to it by ratepayers or a class of ratepayer in respect of specified property.  The making of such a scheme is subject to the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Any application received for a rate waiver scheme is carefully considered by me.  However, in considering any such application, it would have to be borne in mind that a waiver of rates for one class of ratepayer could unfairly impact on other businesses in the area by giving a competitive advantage to a certain group through a reduction of costs.  In addition, the introduction of a waiver scheme could increase costs on the part of ratepayers who are not part of the scheme, as they could be required to make up the costs of the waiver scheme through the payment of additional rates.  This would impose an additional burden in what are already difficult economic circumstances.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>As Minister, my role is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority. The adoption of individual development contribution schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.  It is a matter for the members to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply.</P>
        <P>Details of individual development contribution schemes and local authority annual reports are available directly from each planning authority. Each planning authority is required to include details of contributions received and contributions owing to it, together with information on how the contributions have been expended, in their statutory annual report.</P>
        <P>A new requirement was introduced by my Department for the financial year 2008 requiring the inclusion, by each local authority, of details in the annual statement of all outstanding uncollected levies.  The Department has reviewed the provisional financial information to hand from local authorities on the level of contributions owed to them at the end of 2008. This indicates a figure in excess of &euro;800m. However, this figure does not include any provision for bad or doubtful debts, and may well include contributions in respect of developments not yet commenced (and for which payments are not yet due). It is reasonable to expect, therefore, that a certain level of data adjustment may be required.</P>
        <P>At this stage, many of the 2008 Annual Financial Statements are subject to full audit by the Local Government Audit Service. On completion of the audits for the 2009/2010 audit cycle in March 2010, my Department will have full information on development contributions that are due and outstanding at the end of 2008. My Department does not hold information on the number of accounts due that are in excess of &euro;5 million for any of the years 2007-2009.</P>
        <P>As outlined in the reply to Question No. 25 of 24 June 2009, the overall Development Contributions balance at 31 December 2007, comprising both cash and debtors, was some &euro;1.5 billion. The provision for bad/doubtful debts for 2007 was &euro;98 million. The accounting code of practice requires local authorities to submit their Annual Financial Statements for the proceeding year by 1 July; therefore the un-audited figures for 2009 are not yet available.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware the Inland Fisheries Bill 2009 was published on the 18 November 2009 and has commenced its passage through the Oireachtas.</P><Col N="294"/>
        <P>In cognisance of the growing obligations on Ireland under European law and in particular responsibilities under the Habitats Directive and Water Framework Directive, the Government has decided that Inland Fisheries Ireland should manage and report on its operations on the basis of the River Basin Districts established for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive.  The House may be aware that there are six River Basin Districts within the area covered by the existing seven Regional Fisheries Boards.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the arguments put forward for retention of the status quo in the seven regions, I remain convinced of the merits of the river basin approach.  Aligning the management of Inland Fisheries Ireland in this way will enable an integrated ecosystem approach to be adopted, which will be fully coordinated with the structures already in place for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive for environmental and habitat protection across all animal species.</P>
        <P>However, I am cognisant of the scale and variety of activities and the location and number of staff across the North West and Western regions and can confirm that the Government has decided that the retention of offices in both Galway and Ballina, within the Western River Basin District, is warranted for an initial period at least.</P>

	<P>The Independent Salmon Group was established in 2006 to examine the implications of fully aligning the management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice.  The Government adopted the key recommendations of the report, which included the creation of a salmon hardship fund for those affected by the cessation of mixed stock fishing.</P>
        <P>The scheme, which was administered by BIM, provided a measure of relief to individuals in line with the level of hardship likely to be experienced on foot of the cessation of fishing.  The level of payment, recommended by the Independent Salmon Group and applied through the scheme, was based on the recorded catch history of the eligible licensees and the average net income per salmon in the commercial drift and draft net fishery.</P>
        <P>I understand that payments to beneficiaries ranged from &euro;1,140 to &euro;190,000 whilst the average payment was approximately &euro;21,000.</P>

        <P>Responsibility for the regulation of electronic communications services rests with the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) in accordance with the requirements of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, as amended, and the EU Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications.</P>
        <P>Issues relating to the provision of electronic communications services are, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant service provider.  The service provider retains the primary responsibility for complaint resolution.  If a customer is not satisfied with the service provider&rsquo;s complaints handling procedures, he or she may contact the Commission for Communication Regulation (ComReg).  Part of ComReg&rsquo;s role is to establish the Codes of Conduct for the handling of consumer complaints by service providers.  Each code sets out the minimum level of service that a customer can expect to receive from a service provider.  ComReg will examine whether any issue that is raised, falls within its powers and may arbitrate in accordance with regulatory obligations.</P>

        <Quest> the breakdown of expenditure for the &euro;7.4 million allocated to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for 2010; the mechanism in place to ensure the money is spent prudently and appropriately; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>In accordance with section 37 of the Act, the setting of the budget for the BAI for any particular year is a matter for the Authority.  While the legislation makes provision in section 37(1) for the Minister to be able to specify the form the estimates should take and any additional information as may be needed, it does not require the estimates to be submitted for specific Ministerial approval.  </P>
        <P>The budget for 2010 has been set by the BAI at &euro;7.6 million which will be fully funded by the industry levy as provided for in the Act.  Details of this budget have been submitted to my Department and I will be considering if additional information is required. In accordance with section 37(7) of the Act, this 2010 estimate of income and expenditure will be published shortly by the BAI on its website, with my consent and that of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>The BAI has indicated that the increase in the budget for 2010 over that of the 2009 budget for the BCI is as a result of the increased role given by the Oireachtas to BAI.  While the BAI has taken over the functions of the BCI and the BCC, it has also been given a range of new functions additional to those held by its predecessors, mainly in relation to public service broadcasting and the provision of digital broadcasting services.  The BAI has also indicated that the extent to which this budget is actually expended will depend on the level of activity of the organisation.  They have confirmed that they will discharge their functions in a cost effective manner and are conscious of not imposing an undue burden on the broadcasting sector.</P>
        <P>In this context, section 32(4) of the Broadcasting Act, requires the Authority to ensure that regulation by the Authority and the statutory committees does not involve the imposition or maintenance of unnecessary administrative burdens.  In addition to including this provision in legislation, I have made it clear to the Authority the need to be particularly vigilant about keeping costs down in the current economic climate.  I understand that the Authority has requested the Chief Executive to continuously review its proposed expenditure throughout 2010 with the aim of reducing it where possible.  In accordance with section 33 of the Act, any <Col N="298"/>surplus of levy income over expenditure in 2010 shall be offset against future levies or refunded, as appropriate.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 521 to 523, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>In December 2008, my Department entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  The company is required to provide services, using a mix of technologies, to all fixed residences and businesses that are located within the NBS Coverage Area and which seek a service.</P>
        <P>3 continues to progress its network rollout and NBS broadband services are available in almost half of the 1,028 designated Electoral Divisions (ED) to be covered under the Scheme.  With particular reference to County Mayo, the table below, shows the 112 EDs to be covered under the NBS in the County and identifies the 49 EDs, which can now avail of the NBS broadband services.  Details of all the areas to be covered by the NBS, including the status of the NBS rollout, are available at www.three.ie/nbs.  Under the NBS contract, all EDs in the NBS Coverage Area will have broadband connectivity by end September 2010. </P>

	<P>In December 2008, my Department entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  The company is required to provide services, using a mix of technologies, to all fixed residences and businesses that are located within the NBS Coverage Area and who seek a service.</P>
        <P>3 continues to progress its network rollout and NBS broadband services are available in almost half of the 1,028 designated Electoral Divisions (ED) to be covered under the Scheme. With particular reference to County Sligo, the table below, shows the 22 EDs to be covered under the NBS in the County and identifies the 11 EDs, which can now avail of the NBS broadband services.  Details of all the areas to be covered by the NBS, including the status of the NBS rollout, are available at www.three.ie/nbs.  Under the NBS contract, all EDs in the NBS Coverage Area will have broadband connectivity by end September 2010.</P>

	<P>All works carried out under the Home Energy Savings Scheme are underpinned by a comprehensive Technical Specification and Code of Practice for contractors which ensure that works undertaken represent best value for each homeowner&rsquo;s investment and also best value for all public monies expended.</P>
        <P>In general, all products used must be fit for purpose, improve the energy efficiency of the building and have no detrimental impact on the structure, viability, quality or safety of the property.  All insulation products must meet relevant product standards.  One underlying objective of this Scheme is to put in place materials that will achieve a level of performance in the home, equivalent to the standard required in the most recent update of Part L of the Building Regulations.</P>
        <P>The standard for Wall Insulation is to achieve a U-value of 0.27 W/m2K for external walls.  Different materials have different thermal performance and so the thickness of material required is dependent on the material selected as well as the existing wall construction form and what insulation might already exist.  Insulation thickness only becomes an issue in the case of dry-lining walls because with cavity wall insulation, Sustainable Energy Ireland only requires the cavity to be fully filled.  Budget 2010 has not led to any modification to the requirements of the scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 528 and 529 together.  </P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) collects and publishes energy statistics to support policy analysis and development, in line with national needs and international obligations.  Every six months SEI publishes a report on Understanding Electricity and Gas Prices in Ireland, which details electricity and gas prices to every category of domestic and industrial user and compares those figures with other Member States of the European Union.</P>
        <P>The latest SEI report was published on January 24th 2010 and contained comparative price data to 30th June 2009.  I have requested SEI to send a copy of this report to the Deputy but broadly speaking the report found that falling electricity and gas prices are bringing Irish energy costs closer in line with and, in some cases below, European averages.</P>
        <P>Ireland experienced the third largest price drop in electricity prices to industry across the entire EU over the 12 month period ending on 30th June 2009.  At the same time, 22 of 27 EU countries experienced price increases.  Gas prices also continued to fall with a result that gas prices are now 7% to 10% below the EU average in the two main consumption bands for business.</P>
        <P>As well as comparative figures, SEI&rsquo;s report also provides valuable insight into the drivers of higher energy costs in our market.  Our high energy costs are primarily due to significant dependence on volatile imported fossil fuels, particularly gas, as well a requirement for very significant investment in energy infrastructure, following two decades of under-investment in the networks.  The under-investment in networks and power generation posed real risks to security of supply which had become a major concern for enterprise.</P>
        <P>The Government remains firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on energy prices, and also towards ensuring diversity of energy supply to reduce our exposure to high and volatile external energy prices.  Significant progress has been made to date, most notably with the all-island Single Electricity Market now in place, <Col N="304"/>the sale of ESB generation capacity, entry of new players and new generation capacity coming on-stream in the Irish market.</P>
        <P>The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.  There is no price control on petroleum products and prices at the pump reflect global market price, transportation costs, euro/dollar fluctuations and other operating costs.  Price differences are an ongoing feature of the market economy and it is a matter for retailers to explain price differences where they occur.</P>

	<P>Under the national smart meter pilot project smart meters have been installed in 6,500 households around the country to underpin the electricity customer behaviour trial.  All meters being used for this trial have been collecting baseline data since 1 July last year.  The trial went live on 1 January this year.  The electricity technology trial is assessing metering functionality and supporting information and communications systems.  Installation of a further 5,000 meters is underway for technology testing in Limerick/Ennis, Cork City/Bandon and South Dublin/Wicklow.  The electricity element of the pilot phase will be completed in December 2010.</P>
        <P>Meters have been installed in 1,925 households around the country for the Gas Customer Behaviour Trial and have been collecting data since 1 December last.  A further 500 meters will be installed in households to facilitate the Gas Technology Trials.  The gas trials will go live next June and will continue until May 2011.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Television licence revenue is generated from the sales of television licences and the recoupment of the cost of free television licences from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There is no fund reserve as such because the revenue generated is received and paid out on an ongoing basis.  The annual income generated from television licences was &euro;226.2m in 2009.</P>
        <P>Under Section 123 of the Broadcasting Act, 2009, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, I may pay RT&Eacute; in respect of each financial year an amount equal to the total of receipts in that year in respect of broadcasting (TV) licence fees less (i) any expenses incurred in relation to the collection of those fees, and (ii) an amount being equal to 7% of these net television licence fee receipts, which is paid under Section 156 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in respect of the Broadcasting Funding Scheme.  This amount was increased from 5% to 7% under the 2009 Act.  In effect, therefore, RT&Eacute; is now being paid 93% of net television licence fee receipts on an annual basis.</P>

	<P>The Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) continues to develop and grow the Digital Hub.  There are 835 full-time employees and 350 part-time employees currently working in 97 Digital Hub companies.  The Hub has attracted significant inward investment with approximately 10% of the enterprise cluster and 30% of the employees resulting from foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>The DHDA continues to successfully promote the identity and brand of the Hub and companies located there have enjoyed notable successes and have gained national and international recognition.  The Hub is a sought after location for digital media companies and the cluster effect is recognised as an attractive environment for innovation.</P>
        <P>On its educational remit the DHDA delivers a very successful learning programme, which provides state-of-the-art digital media education to schools and the wider community in Dublin&rsquo;s inner city.  The DHDA has developed an award-winning community engagement process, the Community Public Private Partnership (CPPP).  To date, 36 digital media learning programmes have been delivered to 10,000 participants in local schools and community groups.</P>
        <P>The DHDA has leased office space to meet the requirements of its tenant companies and has reached the point where all of its own available space has been occupied &mdash; approximately 80,000 square feet.  A further 80,000 square feet is occupied by Digital Hub tenants under interim lease arrangements with third parties.  An additional 20,000 square feet will be delivered by next April through redevelopment of a building in the Hub in partnership with the OPW.</P>
        <P>The level of Exchequer funding for the agency has fallen over the years from 100% to approximately 40% in 2009.  The Agency had plans for the development of further office space that would have eliminated its reliance on Exchequer funding.  This development is not progressing at present in light of the current economic climate and the Agency is pursuing the matter with the two developers concerned.  Meanwhile I will shortly undertake a review of the DHDA in light of its work to date, the implications of current economic circumstances for its future funding and its potential role in delivery of the Government&rsquo;s objectives for the smart economy.</P>

        <P>The only petroleum discovery that has been declared commercial but has yet to be developed is the Corrib Gas Field. Construction of the Corrib Gas Terminal at Bellanaboy is almost completed as are the subsea facilities at the Corrib Gas Field.  Last summer the 83km offshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline was installed.  The developers are engaged in the process of securing a number of statutory consents required for the construction of the onshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline.</P><Col N="306"/>
        <P>Completion of the development works by the developers is the principal factor that will determine the date for first gas.  There are currently no new mineral discoveries that are proving commercially viable; however, there have been some encouraging results.</P>

        <P>As of 12 January 2010, there was 1260MW of installed wind capacity on the system and as of 25 November 2009, there was a further 1415MW of wind projects contracted to connect.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and EirGrid have calculated that around 5,800 megawatts (MWs) of renewable capacity will be required to deliver the 40% target in 2020.</P>
        <P>The CER decision on the &lsquo;Gate 3&rsquo; round provides for connection offers for 4,000 MW of additional renewable electricity capacity.  Approximately 90% of these offers are wind powered capacity including around 800 MW of offshore wind.  The list of projects included in the Gate 3 decision can be found in the CER Decision 08/260, which can be found on its website at: www.cer.ie.  Gate 3 connection offers began to issue in December 2009 and rollout of the offers will continue on a phased basis over the next 18 months.</P>
        <P>The decision by CER on Gate 3 projects is potentially capable of delivering the 40% national target for the contribution from renewable energy resources to electricity consumed by 2020.  In the event of any non take-up of the Gate 3 offers, the CER would intend to add replacement projects, to ensure delivery of the 2020 target.</P>

	<P>Wind generation is the most abundantly available alternative renewable energy technology in Ireland.  The development of onshore wind generation in the Irish electricity system is supported under the Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT) which guarantees a minimum price for wind generation.  This cost is recouped through a public service obligation (PSO) paid by all electricity users.  For the last two years the overall PSO levy has been set at zero by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) due to a combination of offsetting factors.</P>
        <P>Recently completed research by CER and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) respectively have examined the costs of renewable electricity under a range of scenarios including fossil fuel and carbon prices to 2020.  Their respective research generally concludes that high levels of wind capacity can provide a hedge against high fossil fuel prices particularly gas prices.  It is the case that when fossil fuel and carbon prices are low, high wind penetration will be more expensive.</P>
        <P>The ESRI concludes overall that in a scenario of mid range to high oil and gas prices over the coming years extensive wind generation could facilitate reductions in Irish electricity prices.  I agree with the ESRI that investment in renewable energy provides a valuable insurance policy against the risk of future high fossil fuel and carbon prices as well as achieving a significant reduction in emissions.  I also agree with the International Energy Agency that the era of cheap oil is over.</P><Col N="308"/>
        <P>The impact which renewable electricity will have on Irish electricity prices in 2015 will depend on the price of fossil fuels and carbon at that time.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 539 and 540 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of broadband services, including the provision of such services to the health and financial services sectors, is a matter for electronic communications service providers who operate in a fully liberated market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</P>
        <P>Government policy pertaining to the electronic communications market in Ireland is set out in &ldquo;Next Generation Broadband &mdash; Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland&rdquo;, which I published in June 2009.  The policy paper was developed in accordance with various key principles, which are crucial to the development of the market including (i) competition, at platform and service levels, which drives innovation and investment (ii) investment certainty for service providers considering investing in network infrastructure, (iii) investment intervention by Government to bridge any digital divide in cases of market failure and to meet certain of the State&rsquo;s own communication needs, and (iv) appropriate regulation.  The policy paper sets out the Government&rsquo;s position that investment in broadband infrastructure is primarily a matter for the private sector, facilitated, where appropriate and possible, by Government.</P>
        <P>Existing policy has facilitated significant progress in broadband roll out and broadband quality over recent years.  According to ComReg&rsquo;s Quarterly Report for Q3/2009, 68% of residential subscriptions in Ireland are in the 2-10 Mbps range.  72% of the non-residential subscriptions in Ireland are in the 2-10Mbps range.  Only 21% of the non residential subscriptions and only 24% of the residential subscriptions are in the 1-2 Mbps range.  Higher speeds, in some cases up to 50Mbps are also available to residential and SME customers in urban areas.  For example, speeds of up to 24Mbps are available from DSL providers, 50Mbps products are available from fibre operators and 20Mbps products are available from cable operators.</P>
        <P>I have no specific information on the quality of broadband services provided to the health and financial services sectors.</P>

	<P>Directive 2002/58/EC (Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications) contains provisions prohibiting the sending of unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes (spam).  This Directive was transposed into national law in November 2003 via the Data Protection and Privacy Regulations 2003 (SI No. 535 of 2003).  The regulations prohibit the sending of unsolicited phone calls or emails for direct marketing purposes and provide for a summary offence in respect of each unsolicited call.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  In 2008, I amended the regulations in order to strengthen the Commissioner&rsquo;s enforcement powers by providing for an indictable offence, carrying a penalty of up to &euro;250,000 or 10% of turnover, whichever is the greater.  These penalties are in line with the highest in the EU and should provide an effective deterrent against this practice.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and other private sector and not-for-profit organisations have, since 2004, conducted a number of  public awareness campaigns called &ldquo;Make It Secure&rdquo;, to promote the safe use of the Internet, and to reduce the spread and effect of computer viruses.</P>
        <P>The campaign is designed to increase awareness among citizens of the most common security risks related to accessing and transacting on the Internet &mdash; such as identity theft, spyware, and phishing.

	<P>Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act, 2009 provides for the development of digital terrestrial television in Ireland.</P>
        <P>This Act requires RT&Eacute; to provide a national &lsquo;free to air&rsquo; digital service with capacity to carry RT&Eacute; 1, RTE 2, TG4 and TV3 by the end of 2011 or such later date as I may specify.  The RT&Eacute; &lsquo;free to air&rsquo; digital service is to replace the existing analogue terrestrial television service and I wish to make it clear, at this stage, that it is my intention that the date stipulated in the Act for the &lsquo;free to air&rsquo; DTT launch should be met.</P>
        <P>In addition, the 2009 Act requires the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), an independent regulatory authority, to provide for the development of commercial digital terrestrial television services.</P>
        <P>On foot of this requirement, the BAI&rsquo;s predecessor, the BCI, launched a competition, which is still ongoing.  As the Deputy is aware, the highest placed consortium in the competition withdrew from the process last April.  Negotiations then commenced with the next placed bidder and this process is continuing.</P>
        <P>While I have no direct function in these matters, I would like to see this process concluded as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In relation to the rollout of DTT services, I am informed by RT&Eacute; that, to date, 13 sites have been upgraded to accommodate both the single &lsquo;free to air&rsquo; DTT multiplex and also three commercial DTT multiplexes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 546 and 558 together.</P>
        <P>At the moment there are no specific plans in place to allow a resumption of commercial fishing for sea bass.  However, the Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) has made a proposal regarding the possibility of a limited offshore Sea Bass fishery to my colleague Minster Killeen.</P>
        <P>Minister Killeen is giving careful consideration to this proposal in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and is particularly conscious of the necessity of maintaining the existing protection afforded to the inshore Sea Bass fishery.   This factor is also recognised in the FIF proposal which gives assurances that the inshore Sea Bass fishery around our coast would not be targeted for commercial fishing. Under the FIF proposal, vessels would be permitted to land  Sea Bass caught south of  (51.30&rsquo;N) in area VII. This area is approx 50 KM off the SE coast of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Given the overall economic situation and the challenges facing fishermen generally, Minister Killeen is anxious to pursue any proposal that would create additional commercial fishing opportunities for the Irish fleet. In that context Minister Killeen has written to Minister Lenihan in the Department of Energy, Communications and Natural Resources, who has responsibility for inland fisheries, seeking his views on this proposal before making any final decision in the matter.</P>

	<P>Drafting of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill, which gives effect to commitments in the Programme for Government and the Renewed Programme for Government is ongoing in my Department. The legislation will amend and consolidate legislation in the area of animal health, particularly to reflect the changed disease status of our animals. Existing legislation will also be updated, including provisions of the Protection of Animals Act 1911, to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals, is properly protected and that the penalties for offenders are increased significantly. The proposed legislation will also provide for the consolidation of responsibility for the welfare of all animals within my Department. I intend to submit the proposed heads of this Bill to the Government at an early date this year.</P>

	<P>I would like to put on record that at no point has compensation been awarded to fishermen in the Castlemaine Harbour, County Kerry, area. It therefore follows that no qualifying criteria exist.</P>
        <P>As a non-prejudicial, once off response to the events of late 2000, early 2001, whereby the bottom grown mussel industry in Castlemaine Harbour suffered protracted closures due to biotoxin incidence, resulting in an inability for operators to market their stock during the usual sale period of October to December, the Government decided to provide funding for an Industry Revitalisation Programme, designed exclusively as a rebuilding measure. The qualifying criteria for the Revitalisation Programme required that eligible applicants be those operators who: Were licensed under the 1998-2003 Ground Allocation by the Castlemaine Harbour Fishermen&rsquo;s Co-op Society Ltd., in accordance with the Mussel Fishery (Castlemaine Harbour) Order 1979.  Had transplanted either individually, or as part of a group, seed mussels between the 16th and the 21st October 1999, from Inch Point and Rossbeigh Point into the intertidal nursery areas, Area F, known locally as Ban Fluic.</P>

	<P>I am aware that due to very wet conditions in November 2009 a proportion of the total national area of potatoes remained unharvested at the end of the year. Since Christmas Ireland has experienced very severe frost conditions which have resulted in losses to potatoes and other crops. The extent of losses is difficult to quantify at this stage. It would be influenced by the nature of the crop, its location and the extent to which it was exposed.  I have received representations on behalf of growers in relation to the losses incurred and the matter is currently being considered by officials in my Department.</P>

	<P>To be eligible under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme applicants are required, inter alia, to occupy and farm a minimum of three hectares of forage land; land designated as other than forage is not eligible. The closing date for the 2009 Scheme was 15 May 2009. The Scheme provided for amendments forms to be submitted up to 31 May 2009, without penalty, and afterwards up to 9 June 2009, subject to penalty. However, applicants were advised that land could not be added after that date.</P>
        <P>The person named submitted an application under the 2009 on 14 April 2009, in respect of which payment in full issued on 21 September 2009.  An amendment form was submitted on 22 December 2009, the land use of the additional land being declared as &lsquo;bog&rsquo;; however, as this application was both late and in respect of ineligible land, no further payment was due to the person named.</P>

	<P>Mindful of the hardship and distress caused by the recent widespread flooding, on 27 November 2007 I announced the introduction of the Fodder Aid Scheme, targeted directly at those farmers who encountered damage to fodder in the affected areas. While I was very anxious that the funding reach the affected farmers as quickly as possible, it was essential that farmers demonstrate that their fodder was damaged and to what extent. To this end, therefore, it was necessary that each claim be verified by an on-the-spot inspection. I had initially set the closing date for receipt of applications as 11 December, but subsequently extended it by one week. Immediately applications began to be received by my Department, the necessary inspections were begun, following which the applications were further processed for payment. I am pleased to say that payments commenced issuing on 18 December and, to date, payments worth &euro;504,074 have issued to 237 applicants.

	<P>There are currently some 21,000 part-time undergraduate students enrolled in the university and institute of technology sectors. It is not known how many of these students would qualify under any extension of the Free Fees Initiative as this would be determined by the eligibility criteria that would apply to such a scheme, including for example, residency, nationality, previous higher education attainment etc. The availability of free fees would also be likely to impact on future demand for access to higher education on a part-time basis.    Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that any estimate of costs is very tentative depending on the range of variables referred to.</P>
        <P>The annual revenue that is currently generated by part-time tuition fees amounts to some &euro;40 million.

In due course, both grant schemes <Col N="323"/>will be merged.  In the interim, both grants will continue to be paid according to existing timelines and calculated separately as heretofore.</P>
        <P>Primary schools may use this funding to support the implementation of the curriculum, including Physical Education.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in anticipation of the review and recent updating of Children First, my Department wrote to all the education partners last Autumn inviting submissions from them on potential changes that might be desirable to the Department&rsquo;s existing child protection guidelines to schools.  The education partners were also invited to participate in a working party to  review the guidelines and the working party commenced its work before Christmas.</P>
        <P>I have also recently re-iterated my view that ensuring that the Stay Safe  Programme is implemented in all schools to ensure child safety is important and  it for this reason that I have stated my intention to have it included as a mandatory requirement for all schools.</P>

	<P>The supply teacher scheme was initially set up at primary level over 15 years ago at a time when schools had difficulty getting substitute teachers. The supply scheme operates on the basis of an additional full-time teacher being allocated to a school to cover certified sick leave absences in that school and a cluster of neighbouring schools. If the teacher is not required on a given day to cover sick leave absences they generally assist with other work in their school such as administrative duties. There are 60 posts allocated to the scheme. A value for money review was published in July 2006. The review found that approximately 60% of these teachers&rsquo; time was used to cover sick leave <Col N="325"/>absences with the balance on various other school duties. This reflects the unpredictable nature of sick leave absences.</P>
        <P>While there are benefits for schools in having these full-time teachers it is  considered more cost effective to use the normal substitution arrangements that  apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences instead of having a cohort of full-time teachers &ldquo;on call&rdquo; all the time in these schools to cover sick leave absences that may or may not arise.</P>
        <P>The supply teacher scheme will cease from the start of the 2010/11 school year.  The teachers concerned will be redeployed in accordance with the existing  redeployment arrangements to other schools that have vacancies.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have repeatedly stated my, and the Government&rsquo;s, commitment to supporting Protestant education while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements for schools under Protestant management are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
        <P>Indeed, it is in order to deal with the concerns expressed by some members of the Protestant community of the effect of changes to certain funding arrangements on Protestant second-level schools that I have sought to ensure the direct engagement with those involved in Protestant education in identifying and resolving issues collaboratively.</P>
        <P>I have had meetings with a number of groups on this issue. On 21 October, I met with the Committee on Management for Protestant Schools. I extended an invitation to that committee to join a working group with my officials to identify particular measures to support the schools and consider options that might deal with their needs. Regrettably, the committee declined my invitation.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and has been assigned a band rating of 3. There is no deficit of mainstream accommodation at the school and the application relates to ancillary accommodation/refurbishment.</P>
        <P>Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is now available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.

	<P>Details on prefab units for County Cavan and Monaghan are provided in the table below.</P>
        <P>The overall policy goal is to ensure the highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools. However, I&rsquo;m sure the Deputy will appreciate that in the context of a rapidly increasing school population, the necessity to put additional accommodation in place in a short time-frame and competing pressure on the capital budget, it will continue to be necessary to use temporary accommodation to meet the needs of schools in certain circumstances.  This is because competing priorities mean that it will not always be possible to have a permanent accommodation solution in place in a short time-frame. My Department will continue to provide funding for such prefabricated accommodation and the decision on whether to rent or purchase will depend on the likely length of time it will be required. In all cases, the approach will be to ensure best value for money.</P>
        <P>The overall amount spent on the rental of temporary accommodation in 2008 was almost &euro;53m. In 2009, expenditure on the rental of temporary accommodation fell significantly to &euro;39m, a saving of &euro;14m over 2008.</P>
        <P>One change in policy that has been implemented is to grant aid the purchase (rather than rental) of temporary accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than 3 years. Furthermore, since July 2008, it is my policy to offer schools being approved for grant aid for temporary accommodation the option to use their capital grant aid to build a permanent classroom(s) rather than purchase a prefab.</P>
        <P>These policies will reduce the usage of temporary accommodation and, particularly, the incidence of long term rental of prefabs and have contributed to the saving of &euro;14m on annual expenditure on rental of temporary accommodation in 2009 as compared to 2008.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department has engaged a specialist firm to develop new procedures and systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving best value for money. Work is well underway and the firm of specialists is working closely with officials in the Planning and Building Unit of my Department. The review incorporates the development of standard specifications for temporary accommodation, the development of new contractual terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation options to cater for individual local circumstances and appropriately protect the interests of the Department and school authorities.</P>
        <P>Another strand of the review is negotiations with prefab suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts or reductions in annual rent, as appropriate. An initial group of 46 schools with rented prefabricated accommodation has been identified for priority negotiations with suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts.</P>
        <P>A number of these prefabs have now been bought-out and negotiations are ongoing with a view to ending rental contracts for as many schools as possible in 2010.</P><Col N="329"/>
        <P>In the meantime, schools proposing to rent temporary accommodation must seek competitive quotes from suppliers which should allow them to take advantage of competitive market prices.</P>

	<P>The Local Authority recently advised my officials that the negotiations with a land owner have concluded and they are now exchanging contracts to complete the sale of a site. My Department, as sought by the Local Authority, has arranged to provide the funding to the Council to enable the transaction to be concluded.</P>
        <P>The Department has already commenced preliminary work on master-planning the site and other associated work and a building project will be progressed to deliver school accommodation for Tyrellstown as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 596 and 597 together.</P>
        <P>Fingal County Council has recently advised my Department that negotiations are continuing in relation to a site for the school referred to by the Deputy. The matter of submitting a planning application will be dependent on the successful completion of the site acquisition by the Local Authority. As the Deputy will appreciate, due to commercial sensitivities relating to site acquisition, I am not in a position to comment further at this time.</P><Col N="331"/>
        <P>When the site has been acquired the progression of the building project on the site will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding a school building (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; if he will expedite a decision to allow the project to move to the next stage in view of the co-operation of the two religious orders to make land available and the need to provide modern accommodation for the amalgamated schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The proposed project for the school to which the Deputy refers has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned 1.4 rating.</P>
        <P>Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is now available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

	<P>The number of permanent teaching posts available in second-level schools at any one time is determined in accordance with the agreed criteria relating to the application of the pupil teacher ratio.

        <P>When deciding on the number of teaching posts, if any, which may be filled in a permanent capacity in a particular school year, the school authorities must take account of the approved teacher allocation for the school for that year, the number of permanent teachers currently <Col N="336"/>employed, including those on approved leave, the overall limits as to the level of permanency as agreed from time to time and the need for flexibility to cater for the needs of all of the pupils attending the school.  The assignment of teachers to individual classes within the overall approved allocation is a matter for the authorities of the school concerned.</P>
        <P>Teachers who are on approved leave (e.g. career break, secondment, study leave, sick leave, maternity leave) or in job-sharing arrangements are entitled to return to their full-time teaching positions at the end of their period of approved leave/job-sharing.  Replacement teachers may be appointed but, because of the permanent teachers&rsquo; right to return to their posts, the replacement teachers may only be appointed in a temporary capacity.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is at present carrying out a review of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) allocations in all schools with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts, as outlined in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 07/02, are properly met.  This is an exercise in identifying surplus posts which are in the system and which do not meet the current criteria &mdash; posts that have been retained when a pupil&rsquo;s care needs have diminished or where the pupil has left.</P>
        <P>SENOs are communicating the outcome of the review directly to schools as the review progresses.  The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any surplus identified.  It is expected that the NCSE will have completed the review by the end of March 2010.</P>
        <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the SNA support will continue to be made available to schools which have enrolled pupils who qualify for such support.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 616 and 622 together.</P>
        <P>My Department provides funding for thirty eight projects in Local Drugs Task Force areas, including the project specifically referred to by Deputy McGrath. These projects, through a variety of programmes and activities, seek, in the main, to encourage young people not to engage in drug-taking. My Department originally took on responsibility for funding these projects through a mainstreaming process, whereby projects on interim funding were assigned to a number of departments and State agencies. Thirty five of the projects are administered by the three VECs in Dublin City, Dublin County and in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, while the remaining three projects are funded directly by my Department. The allocation for the 38 projects over the past three years were as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2007 &mdash; &euro;3,621,000;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2008 &mdash; &euro;3,715,000;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Arising from Budget 2010, it was decided that funding for these projects was to be reduced to &euro;2,461,000 in 2010. My Department is currently reviewing the implications of this decision for the individual projects concerned.</P>

	<P>The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years. This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs in addition to recent schools&rsquo; enrolment data. The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 selected locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas. Following from this detailed analysis it appears prudent to plan for the establishment of new schools to commence operation in September 2010 to meet increasing demand in up to nine identified areas. The area referred to by the Deputy has been identified as one of these areas.</P>

        <P>In December 2009, after following the aforementioned process required under the Act, I appointed 11 of the 13 NCSE Council members for the 2010-2012 term of office. Each of the appointees has a special interest in, or knowledge relating to, the education of children with <Col N="341"/>special educational needs. The two remaining members will be appointed from nominees of the National Disability Authority.</P>

	<P>Over 2,300 schools submitted applications by the closing date on 27 November 2009 in respect of the Summer Works Scheme 2010. Following an assessment process which is currently underway, projects will be selected for funding from all valid and approved applications on a top down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria published with the Scheme. When the assessment process is completed I shall be in a position to announce the successful applicant schools under the Summer Works Scheme 2010. The total funding available for the school capital programme 2010 is &euro;579m and this will allow my Department to deliver a similar sized programme of large and small scale building projects in primary and post-primary schools as was provided in 2009. It is not expected that the Summer Works Scheme 2010 will differ significantly in scale from the Scheme delivered in 2009.</P>

        <Quest> if all schools throughout the country, including DEIS banded schools, are subject to water charges; and if it is his policy to only allow schools in non-rented accommodation access to water saving measures under the summer works scheme. </Quest>

	<P>Since 1 January 2010, all schools, including those within the DEIS programme, are liable for full metered water charges. In order to avoid substantial increases in their water charges, it is essential that schools put in place water conservation measures. Actions that schools can take in this regard were included in Circular 46/2008, issued by my Department in April 2008. Schools were advised to develop a water management plan, in order that they be familiar with the water distribution systems serving the school and the areas where water is used along with potential areas for wastage and leakage. Practical suggestions for reducing water consumption, along with examples of best practice, were also included. However, as advised to schools in Circular 64/2009, data from local authorities indicates that water consumption levels in many schools remains too high. Schools are urged to reduce water consumption to a recommended per capita usage of 2.1 cubic metres. </P>
        <P>Under the terms and conditions of the Summer Works Scheme 2010, it is open to all schools with permanent recognition to apply for water conservation measures, including those with prefabricated buildings, whether owned or rented by a school.</P>
        <P>The exception to this provision concerns schools that are occupying rented buildings from a private landlord.  Schools occupying such buildings should contact their landlord to explore the possibility of having water conservation measures implemented by the landlord. The full terms and conditions of the Summer Works Scheme are contained in Circular letter 0057/2009, which is published on my Department&rsquo;s website: www.education.ie.</P>
