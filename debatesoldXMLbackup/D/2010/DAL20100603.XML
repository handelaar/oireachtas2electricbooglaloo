      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with two notices under Standing Order 32.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the urgent need to support proper facilities at the Dublin city mortuary at the O&rsquo;Brien Institute, Malahide Road, Dublin 3, as promised four years ago, and to end the practice of relatives and people in mourning having to use a portacabin; and to call on the Government and Dublin City Council to make this a priority issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I request the adjournment of the Dail under standing Order 32 to discuss an urgent matter of public importance, namely, the closure of a residential bungalow unit at &Aacute;ras Attracta disability services, Swinford, County Mayo.  &Aacute;ras Attracta was set up 22 years ago and has 116 high-dependency residents, all with different level of disabilities.  The unit that is closing was home to ten people with an intellectual disability and is the second such bungalow to be closed at &Aacute;ras Attracta in the past 14 months.  Its closure will lead to overcrowding and a return to the use of bedroom sharing which is a breach of HIQA&rsquo;s standards and regulations.  I appeal to the Minister to reverse this decision immediately.</P>

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 10<i>b</i> and 10<i>c</i> shall be decided without debate and in the case of 10<i>c</i>, the motion and all amendments thereto shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair.

	<P>There are two proposals to put to the House today.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 10<i>b</i>, Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Carbon Revenue Levy) Bill 2010, financial resolution, and 10<i>c</i>, motion re sittings and business of the D&aacute;il, agreed to?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with the Ceann Comhairle in welcoming Dr. Paisley and his good wife to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery of the D&aacute;il.  Over the years we have heard the voice of Dr. Paisley on many issues, usually much louder than mine.  I might have disagreed with him on many issues but on one I would always agree, and that is the question of the accountability of parliament.</P>
        <P>I disagree with these motions and with the Order of Business.  It includes a proposal that the House should come together on Wednesday and Thursday of next week without any accountability, any legislation, any questions to a Minister, any Leaders&rsquo; Questions and any Adjournment debate, at a time when we expect that two major banking reports are to be put into the public domain, at a time when the Taoiseach refuses to come in here on Thursday mornings, at a time when the Government clearly has something to hide or is afraid to return to the House to answer questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I join with Deputy Kenny in welcoming Dr. Paisley and his wife to the House.  This is an historic occasion.</P>
        <P>The Government proposal before the House this morning in regard to next week is unconstitutional, a matter I will deal with later.  I want first to deal with the political context for this proposal.  The Government had originally intended that there would be no sitting of the House next week because it was anticipated that the three by-elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Whips agreed that last September.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="577"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Dempsey, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which are outstanding, one for a year, would be held next week in conjunction with the referendum on the rights of children.  If the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, had got his act together by now in respect of the Lord Mayor of Dublin&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>He is very seldom here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;we might have had that election too.  The Government does not want to hold the by-elections.  It is afraid of facing the people.  There will not, therefore, be by-elections next week and, because of this, the Government cannot hold the referendum on the rights of children next week.  It is quite a cynical position on the part of Government in terms of it being prepared to sacrifice the welfare of children to protect its own political hide.  As a result of all of this, the House must sit next week.  The Government Chief Whip announced this with some fanfare last weekend.  </P>
        <P>The proposed sitting for next week comprises a day and a half.  I do not have any objection to the business proposed in this regard but the House will be meeting for only a day and a half.  If this is not bad enough, we have before us this morning a proposal that next week there will be no oral questions, Order of Business, Adjournment Debates, Requests under Standing Order 32, Private Members&rsquo; business or votes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>Sin &eacute;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>That type of order for an entire week&rsquo;s business is arrogant.  It shows a Government that is out of touch and that is abusing its majority in the House.  It is a muzzling of Parliament.  I submit that the proposal is not constitutional.  I draw the attention of the House to Article 15.11.1 of the Constitution which states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">1&deg; All questions in each House shall, save as otherwise provided by this Constitution, be determined by a majority of the votes of the members present and voting other than the Chairman or presiding member.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The motion before us states: &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, unless the D&aacute;il shall otherwise order. . . &rdquo;  The problem is that if this motion is passed, the D&aacute;il will have no means by which it may otherwise order business in the House next week because it provides that there shall be no votes in the House.  I put it to the House that the motion proposed by the T&aacute;naiste is not constitutional and should not be taken in this House.  It is unprecedented for any Government to abuse its parliamentary majority by bringing before Parliament a proposal which effectively muzzles it.  That proposal and the manner in which it has been presented prevents the House from making a change next week.</P>
        <P>Let us suppose an issue arises next week.</P>

	<P>On my own behalf and on behalf of my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues in the D&aacute;il Chamber, I join the other party leaders in extending a welcome to Dr. Paisley and his wife.  In witnessing the somewhat boisterous exchanges here this morning, I have no doubt the thought, &ldquo;why have I missed such craic down here in the past?&rdquo; might have crossed Dr. Paisley&rsquo;s mind.  I would have no objection if he went back and said, &ldquo;the craic down there is mighty, we should look at it again&rdquo;.  </P>
        <P>To turn to the business in hand, on my own behalf and my colleague&rsquo;s behalf, we strongly object to the ordering of business not only in terms of the approach today but the ordering of business for next week.  Make no mistake about it, it is a sham session that is being put together for next week.  There is no other way to describe it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The critical issue is not only that there will be no questions, Order of Business or Private Members&rsquo; business next week but that there will be no votes.  Why will there be no votes?  The reality must be that the Government is far too afraid or it already knows that it will not be able to muster enough support to ensure the Government&rsquo;s position if any vote were to be called on any of the matters before the House scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday of next week.  That is at the core of what this is all about.</P>
        <P>This will not impress the wider population who already have a very understandably jaundiced opinion of political life and the role of politicians in serving their needs today.  That applies across the board and it is not only a reflection on Government, it reflects just as uncomfortably on members of the Opposition.</P>
        <P>In terms of the proposition before the House, it would have been better if the Government had decided to continue, as scheduled, not to sit than to come forward with this proposition and the methodology it has employed.  We need only look at what we are facing &mdash; the issues that are presenting here.  Yesterday the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Education and Skills announced curtailments in library services to schools in disadvantaged communities.  We cannot get responses from specific Ministers.  The Minister for Transport sitting beside the T&aacute;naiste is not responding to parliamentary questions &mdash; I am sure this is not only my experience &mdash; on roads and public transport.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Health and Children does not take a serious interest in her portfolio responsibility and kicks everything to the HSE under health.

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;against the backdrop of all we have highlighted here in recent weeks, namely, the State&rsquo;s failure to address the needs of children in State care, it having a disgraceful record and one that needs to be addressed substantively on the floor of this D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>A chairde, this is a shameful proposition.  It is one that not only the Opposition should reject this morning, the House should reject it.  Accordingly, I ask that we unanimously say this is not worth what is being proposed; either the Government should come forward with a real schedule of work for the coming week or forget it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>On the point of order, the Ceann Comhairle responded that he believes the House can vary the Order of Business for next week.  I respectfully suggest to him that I do not see how it can do that, if there is no Order of Business at which the business of the House can be discussed</P>

	<P>Second, if there is no provision for the taking of a division or vote next week, that means that the House will be deprived of making a decision.  I submit that this proposal is not constitutional.  I suggest that at a minimum the Ceann Comhairle should adjourn the House to take some advice on it and to perhaps consult either party leaders or party Whips on the proposal.  </P>
        <P>I draw the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s attention to the fact that Deputy Stagg had proposed seven amendments to this motion from the Government this morning but it will not be possible to deal with those seven amendments individually because the Government proposes that the motion be taken as one question and be put without debate, which will deprive us of the opportunity of dealing with it.</P>
        <P>I recommend that the Ceann Comhairle adjourn the House and take some advice on this.  I submit to him, on behalf of the Labour Party, that the Government proposal before the House is not constitutional.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the House can vary the order next week by agreement of the House.</P>

	<P>The Ceann Comhairle has said that the House can vary the order next week and that the House is the master of its own destiny.  This motion removes the House&rsquo;s mastery of its own destiny and its discretion.  There is no means under the motion the Government is proposing whereby the House can change the order.  The motion sets down the business for next week without any provision or opportunity for that business to be varied.  There will be no Order of Business, no votes and no Private Members&rsquo; time.  It is removing from the House from next week the discretion the House would have in a normal week&rsquo;s business.  I put it to the Ceann Comhairle again that this is not constitutional and I ask him to protect the rights of the Members of this House by, at a minimum, adjourning the House and taking some advice on what I have put to him.</P>

The Government wants the House to return but there is no mention of any accountability or a right to ask questions.  Regarding the HSE, children in care are vulnerable and cannot speak about it.</P>

        <P>We agree on the importance of the Ryan commission, but the T&aacute;naiste, as the Deputy Head of Government, has nothing to lose by having a normal day&rsquo;s business in the D&aacute;il, which would involve the commencement, Leaders&rsquo; Questions, ordinary questions, Adjournment debates, motions and votes.</P>

	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, I would like to say the following.  You adjourned the House for a ten minute period.  I see no reason the Government should not have normal D&aacute;il business next Wednesday and Thursday, and I have made that point vociferously.  I find it regrettable that the Taoiseach walked out of the Chamber after the vote was taken.  This is about his Government proposing that there be no effective accountability in the Chamber next Wednesday and Thursday, beyond the listed legislation, which is important in respect of the Ryan report statements.  However, there should be normal accountability in the way we do business here.</P>
        <P>I have made my point vociferously.  I say to the T&aacute;naiste directly that I see no reason the Government has chosen this attitude.  Somebody on that side said &ldquo;Let them hang&rdquo;, so that we will have an anodyne day where Ministers do not need to attend and where Government Deputies will not be forced to vote, as the motion proposed by the Government does not allow for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We saw the live register figures yesterday for the past month.  There are 6,600 more people on the live register, meaning that there are about 440,000 people out of work.  That does not include all those who have emigrated.  Instead of having a normal week&rsquo;s business next week, Ministers are going on holidays and presenting us with a day and half&rsquo;s business in the House, beginning at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday.  When the Opposition party leaders object to that, as we have done this morning, the response of Ministers right across that front bench is to laugh.  They are laughing at the people.  Have they not done enough damage to the country without now laughing at the people and taking themselves off on holidays next week instead of coming in here for a normal week&rsquo;s business?</P>

You said that the House will be able to vary the Order of Business next week.  I want you to tell us how we will do that.  We will not have any Order of Business, any vote, or any Private Members&rsquo; business, so how are we going to change the Order of Business next week?  I will want it changed next week and I am going to take you at your word.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The ruling is made on the basis of precedent that has been long established in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already ruled on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not care about that.  It is the outcome&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>You said we could change it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The opportunity is there and we are not going to debate it now.  The ruling was made on the basis of long-established precedent in the House.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="590"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.  It is the outcome that concerns me.  When I raised the issue and drew your attention to the Constitution and to what was in the motion, you told us that we would be able to vary the Order of Business for the House next week.  I am going to keep you to that.  You figure out how to do it, because we want the Order of Business varied for next week.  We want a normal week&rsquo;s business here next week, whereby we will be able to put questions, have votes on issues and do normal parliamentary business.  It is the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s problem now; he made the ruling but in doing so he told us we could vary the order next week and that the House was the master of its own destiny.  He must figure out how we will do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It has to be tested.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as this proposal to adjourn until 2.30 p.m. next Wednesday is concerned, the Labour Party opposes it.  If we are going to have an anodyne week it might as well start on Tuesday as Wednesday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;The Members of the House are the masters of their own destiny&rdquo; was the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s phraseology yet after some questioning it became apparent that there is only one set of masters here and that is majority Government rule.  The rest of us have no say.  I fully concur with the previous speaker&rsquo;s point that the Ceann Comhairle has placed on the record an opportunity to alter the proposed structure of the one and a half day sitting of next week and one of the areas that I certainly want to see changed by whatever means is the provision of two hours to address the implementation of the recommendations in the Ryan report.  That is incredible; two hours to address a subject that we have been urging and demanding for several weeks on the first anniversary of the publication of that report.  It is unacceptable that only two hours of debate are to be provided.  All of the other issues aside, it is the single most important matter that is to be addressed and yet the opportunity is such that a great number of Deputies who will have important and useful contributions to make will not have that opportunity.  It does not come anywhere close to what is required.</P>
        <P>Humour is fine but there was nothing at all humorous in the Opposition&rsquo;s efforts this morning to put forward salient arguments for why the proposed ordering of business next week was unacceptable.  I do not believe that the 439,000 unemployed people and their dependent families will view any of this as humorous.  It is nothing of the kind.</P>
        <P>While we are told a whole range of things that will not happen next week, we are not told whether there will be a Cabinet meeting.  I understand the Cabinet meets every week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>

	<P>Will the Cabinet be meeting on Tuesday?</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, what is the sense in ordering business to commence at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday the week of a bank holiday?  The bank holiday is on the Monday; it is not on the Tuesday or Wednesday morning.  I have no doubt there are some honourable souls on the Government benches who would be willing, available and ready to present here as normal next Tuesday.  If the Cabinet is to meet next week, will all the Ministers be in attendance?  If so, let us put that to the test.  Opposition voices are saying the Ministers will all be away on holidays.  Present here at 2.30 p.m. next Tuesday, not on Wednesday, to commence a proper week&rsquo;s business on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  That will be the litmus test.  If the Cabinet is meeting, let Ministers be present here and not in a closed room in Government Buildings or wherever it meets&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in let us remember we are on the Order of Business.  It is 11.45 a.m. and we are still on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>

	<P>Let us present on the floor of this House and let us have the opportunity to see exactly who is here and who is not here.</P>
        <P>This further proposition not to resume business until 2.30 p.m. next Wednesday is unacceptable.  The proposition should be that we meet at 2.30 p.m. next Tuesday and that is what Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing.  That is our amendment to what is proposed.  Surely the Government can have no objection if the Cabinet is already committed to meeting on that day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of them have gone already.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what we need to decide.  Will the Ceann Comhairle accept that amendment and put it to the House first?  I move that we meet next Tuesday at 2.30 p.m. and allow the business of the House to continue as normal as any other week&rsquo;s sitting.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am asking you to deal with a point of order, which is my entitlement under Standing Orders.  I will be brief.  In the course of those exchanges, you indicated to me further, while neglecting to quote the precedent, that it is possible for this D&aacute;il to vary or change the order.  Since you made that statement, the D&aacute;il has voted and decided to set <Col N="594"/>aside Standing Orders 21 and 26 in regard to next week&rsquo;s business.  I am asking you, Ceann Comhairle how, or by what means, can we, as Members of this House or as political groupings in this House, vary the order, in view of the fact that we have voted, under your stewardship, that the taking of any division should be postponed until next week?  We have also discarded in its entirety the Order of Business for next week.</P>

It will be having its Cabinet meeting and will be absent.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two matters, both of which are points of order.  The first is that Members of this House are entitled to make a point of order.  With respect, a Cheann Comhairle, you must take the point of order and hear it.  I appreciate that there has been a bit of ruaille buaille in the course of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Points of order when there is disorder in the House are out of order.</P>

	<P>The Deputy can continue. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The second point of order I am raising is that the motion which the Government has presented about next week&rsquo;s business has not yet been voted on.  There are some questions which I wish to put to you, in your capacity as Chair of the House and the holder of the office to protect our rights here as Members.  In the course of the earlier exchanges, you told us that the House was master of its own destiny and that if the motion was passed we could still vary the Order of Business for next week.</P>
      
        <P>I would like the Ceann Comhairle to tell us how we may do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to vary the Order of Business for next week and I will be proposing to do so at 2.30 p.m. next Wednesday.  If the motion we will shortly be voting on is passed and there is no Order of Business, I would like the Ceann Comhairle to tell me what opportunity I will have to propose that the Order of Business be varied.  If there is no Standing Order 32, what opportunity will I have to ask that the business of the House be set aside to discuss another matter?  If there is no Private Members&rsquo; business, how may I, as an Opposition Deputy, make a proposal on any matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Or Adjournment debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is no Adjournment motion, how will I get a response from a Minister to my questions?  If there are no oral questions, how can I put a question to a Minister on matters of importance?  In any event, how will the House decide on these issues if we do not have an opportunity to divide? </P><Col N="596"/>
        <P>I noted earlier there are provisions in the Constitution to deal with these matters.  I put it to the Ceann Comhairle that he is required to rule on constitutional provisions as they apply directly to the House.  When I asked him to rule on this, he cited precedent but assured the House that we would still be able to vary the business for next week.  I want him to tell us how we may do so if the motion is passed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

I challenge his interpretation that the Government proposes and the House disposes.  We are not a rubber stamp.

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not acceptable.  The Ceann Comhairle spoke about precedent.  That will fundamentally change the relationship between Government and Parliament.  It is not the case, and I will oppose the assertion, that the way the Parliament works is through the Government proposing and the House disposing.  We have rights here.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We have rights as individual Members and as representatives of Opposition parties.  It is the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s responsibility to defend these rights and to be fair to every Member of this House.  The proposed motion, which apparently must be taken without debate, will in effect stand down the rights of Deputies.  It is the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s job to defend our rights, ensure that every Member is treated fairly and prevent the Government from using its parliamentary majority to stand down the rights of the Members of this Parliament.  It can use its majority and I will accept defeat where it proposes Bills or appropriate measures, but it is unconstitutional of the Government to use its parliamentary majority to stand down the rights of Members of this Parliament.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the point I made earlier was simple and could have been of assistance to the Ceann Comhairle.  The Government indeed proposes our business and we vote on it, but the Government does not, for example, own Standing Order 32.  Requests under this Standing Order have only been granted two or three times but it enables Members in assembly to decide whether to respond to urgent matters requiring attention.  No Government has the right to stand down the Standing Order that enables the Parliament in assembly to address a matter it regards as urgent.

	<P>Given that the Government will not allow me to ask questions to be answered next week and I will have no opportunity to table a motion on the Adjournment and no opportunity for priority questions, can the T&aacute;naiste please explain why her Department is now sacking 40 librarians in some of the poorest schools in the country?  How can she justify this given that two weeks ago she told librarians in my constituency that those jobs were safe?</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is completely unacceptable that those librarians would now be sacked by the Government.  It makes no sense whatever.  It is a false economy.  Is the T&aacute;naiste prepared to give an undertaking to safeguard the jobs of those librarians who are making such a difference to the lives of hundreds of children in the most disadvantaged schools?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This was announced at 6 p.m. yesterday evening when it was too late to table parliamentary questions to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills.  There is also no opportunity next week for questions or for an Adjournment debate.  The T&aacute;naiste is hiding behind the excuse that there is no promised legislation in this matter.  It should be dealt with.  It is too late for any of us to raise this matter.  Figures for two schools in my constituency show how the children are improving.</P>

	<P>It would seem to make sense &mdash; subject to agreement from the Minister of State &mdash; to take amendments Nos. 28 and 30 together.  Essentially, they both relate to the same issue.  I do not wish to take the Minister of State short in respect of this matter so I will <Col N="610"/>give him a moment to consider it.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>That makes sense, otherwise we would be covering the same territory unnecessarily.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 28 relates to an issue we discussed yesterday, namely, family adoptions where, in some 99% of instances, a biological mother marries someone who is not the father of her child and where the latter wants to acquire parental rights and responsibilities in law in respect of that child.  We discussed an amendment which would have facilitated the adoption authority conferring guardianship rights on the father.  I made reference to the pleas of the Adoption Board to the effect that a different procedure be put in place to deal with these issues.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and I had some words in respect of the amendment to which I refer when he stated &mdash; as his excuse for not accepting said amendment &mdash; that guardianship issues are an issue for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and that this is an adoption Bill not a guardianship Bill.  The Government opposed what I believed to be a very sensible amendment.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 28 offers an alternative way of dealing with the same issue.  I previously pointed out that as matters stand a biological mother who marries a person who is not the father of her child and who wishes him to acquire parental rights and obligations in respect of the child is placed in the anomalous position of being obliged to jointly adopt her own child with her husband.  This makes no sense.  I do not believe a mother should be obliged to undergo a process which, under Irish law, results in her ceasing to be the biological parent of a child and becoming his or her adoptive parent.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated that he wants to confine the Bill to matters relating to adoption.  In such circumstances, the amendments I have tabled are designed to deal with this matter in an adoption context.</P>

        <P>Amendment No. 28 proposes that after the word &ldquo;couple&rdquo; the phrase &ldquo;or the spouse of the parent of a child&rdquo; be inserted.  This would allow the adoption authority to make an adoption order in favour of the husband, without the mother being obliged to become an adopter.  In effect, this would give rise to structure whereby a mother would retain all of her guardianship and other rights and the husband would acquire guardianship and other rights as an adoptive <Col N="611"/>parent.  A proper assessment would be undertaken in respect of the husband in order to ensure his suitability to have such legal rights conferred upon him.  All of the procedures we previously discussed with regard to notifying the biological father and seeking his views, hearings being held in front of the adoption authority and the Minister of State&rsquo;s added adornment of, where necessary, applications being made to the High Court would all be in place.  However, the artificial mechanism whereby biological mothers are compelled under our law to adopt their own children in order for their husbands to acquire rights and obligations of a parental nature in respect of their children would be removed.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 28 relates to the section in the Bill which specifies the persons who are eligible to adopt.  Amendment No. 30 is what I would describe as the supplementary, substantive measure that would be required.  It proposes to insert, in page 24, between lines 31 and 32, the following into section 20:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;(4) On the application of the spouse of a biological parent desiring to adopt a child to acquire the same rights and responsibilities with regard to the child as the biological parent.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>a</i>) The adoption order shall confer the same rights and responsibilities on the spouse as vest in the biological parent.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>b</i>) Shall not affect the rights and responsibilities of the biological parent.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>c</i>) Where the biological parent with whom the child does not permanently reside continues to have regular contact with the child, the Authority may make an order conferring guardianship rights and responsibilities on the applicant to so act jointly with the child&rsquo;s existing guardian or guardians instead of making an adoption order.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Paragraph (<i>c</i>) is the part of this amendment the Minister of State will not like.  That is because it allows for the alternative option of the guardianship order being made.  However, this could still operate despite the Minister of State&rsquo;s disagreement with the more detailed amendment we addressed previously.  If he were willing to take on board amendment No. 30, I would be willing to amend paragraph (<i>c</i>) in order to facilitate the adoption authority to make an access order in favour of the biological father who agreed to an adoption, without the necessity of this only applying when a guardianship order is made.</P>
        <P>Many hundreds of biological mothers are being placed in the position I have outlined.  I do not believe a biological mother should ever be obliged to adopt her own child.  Nor do I believe that an artificial legal relationship of adoptive parent should be created in circumstances where someone is the biological parent.  That is not in the best interests of the welfare of children, particularly in the very many instances where the biological father has absolutely no involvement nor interest in the life of his child born outside marriage, in the very many cases where the biological father is making no financial contribution by way of support or maintenance for the child, and in the very many instances where the biological father has essentially abandoned the mother and child.  It is clearly in the best interests of the welfare of a child that the spouse of the mother, where she wishes this to occur, where there is a good relationship between the spouse and the child and where the spouse is a thoroughly appropriate person, be allowed to adopt.  This is even more the case where there are subsequent children born of the marital relationship.  Why should the child born prior to marriage, parented by a different father who has no interest in the child, be left in a sort of legal limbo or an anomalous situation where one of two things happen &mdash; either his or her biological mother is turned into an adoptive parent or, if that is not done, no real legal relationship is acquired with the step parent.  I cannot fathom why we should preserve this type of provision in our law.</P><Col N="612"/>
        <P>Over the years of my practice as a solicitor dealing with family problems &mdash; I constantly make declarations of interest in this regard &mdash; I have represented many mothers in circumstances where the fathers of their children have failed to make support payments, resisted making support payments and, after court orders have been obtained against them, have simply disappeared and the support payments become unenforceable.  I have also represented biological fathers who have a genuine interest in their children and who continue a role in the lives of those children in circumstances where they will never marry the biological mothers.  However, I have to say &mdash; I am sorry if it goes against certain levels of political correctness &mdash; a large number of mothers who give birth to children outside marriage find that the fathers have no interest, that no provision is made for support and that they will do as little as they can to provide any assistance.  Unfortunately, the majority of such men never play a role in the lives of their children, not because they are obstructed from doing so by the mothers, but simply because that is the attitude they take.</P>
        <P>It is right that we recognise the rights of fathers and put in place protections for those fathers who genuinely want to play a role in the lives of their children.  While we must recognise that it is absolutely in the interests of the welfare of children that they have a full relationship, where that is possible, with both their biological parents, let us not lose sight of the reality that a large number &mdash; far too many &mdash; men in this State father children, fail to take responsibility, fail to involve themselves in their children&rsquo;s lives, fail to provide adequate supports and, more often than not, it is the mother who bears the burden and the pleasure of real parenting.  While there was a perception in the past that this was always the case and that the father was always the villain, which was unfair, we are now going to the other side.  Now we are assuming that all fathers are supportive and always do the right thing.  I wish that were so.  Sadly &mdash; for many women and children, very tragically &mdash; it is not the case.</P>
        <P>We must make, within a proper legal structure, appropriate arrangements to facilitate mothers bearing the burden and the pleasure of bringing up their children born outside marriage and to have legal relationships conferred on their husbands which recognise them as full parents without the mothers having to adopt their own children.  I referred to the statistics on this yesterday.  In between 99% and 100% of cases, depending on which year one looks at, where a family adoption involves a biological parent and a spouse who is not a parent, the biological parent is the mother.</P>
        <P>We discussed this issue on Committee Stage and I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has listened to some of what we said in some small areas and has tabled some of his own amendments.  However, what I find extraordinary about this process &mdash; it is quite different from my experience prior to 2002 &mdash; is that I have not seen a single Opposition amendment taken on board.  I do not want to personalise this in regard to the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, because it is the ethos of a political party that has been in government for too long.  The ethos of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, which has apparently been distilled into the Green Party&rsquo;s genetic system at an extraordinarily fast rate, is that one does not simply accept an amendment as tabled by an Opposition Deputy.  I do not know whether Ministers fear that this will affect their political CV, undermine their political pedigree, undermine their ministerial authority or make Ministers of State the butt of jokes by their senior colleagues.  I do not know what psyche has entered into the political process to produce this outcome.</P>
        <P>We are not going to finish the debate on this proposal but I urge the Minister of State to look seriously at what I am proposing.  It is in the interests of the welfare of children.  It is not inimical in any way to children or to biological parents.  It does not undermine the rights of biological fathers.  What it does is provide a more logical legal structure to address an issue that is of importance and which is the dominating issue in domestic adoptions.  Too much of <Col N="613"/>the focus of this Bill has been exclusively on inter-country adoption.  I understand the reason for that, with so many people anxious to adopt abroad because there are so few children available to adopt in Ireland.  However, if we focus on domestic adoption, the primary concern of the Adoption Board is family adoptions, the majority by mothers adopting their own children.  Can we not put in place a more sensible structure to facilitate this happening in a manner that is in the best interests of children, does not create artificial legal relationships and does not put a biological mother in the demeaning position where she has to ask the Adoption Board to make an adoption order in her favour?  That is lunacy.  What if the Adoption Board refuses because it does not consider the mother appropriate?  She remains the mother of the child.  The procedure is quite bizarre.</P>
        <P>This debate started an hour and a half later than we thought and will finish at 1 p.m.  I have probably talked too long.  There is a real concern in regard to this issue.  If the Minister of State does not like the terms of the amendments I have tabled, will he, between now and when we come back to deal with Report Stage, table his own?  Let us make one or two real reforms to our adoption law that make sense based on the real issues being dealt with in the area of domestic adoption.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin my contribution now and continue when the debate resumes.  Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s proposals are sensible, are in the interests of the child and address real issues, particularly the issue of natural mothers having to adopt their own children through the Adoption Board, which makes no sense whatsoever.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In the short time remaining I propose to address the issue raised by Deputy Shatter regarding the rights and responsibilities of fathers.  In practical terms he is probably right that the majority of fathers in the circumstances in which he described, where there is no relationship with the mother, do not participate very much in their children&rsquo;s lives.  However, I am strongly of the view that we must challenge and change that culture.  We must give fathers both the opportunity and the responsibility to involve themselves in their children&rsquo;s lives.  That is the cultural change towards which we must work.  We should not accept the situation as a given and simply move on from there.</P>
        <P>There are many fathers who would love to have a say in their children&rsquo;s lives; I have met some of them.  There are two sides to this and the father&rsquo;s side has not yet been given the type of protection in law, in respect of the rules regarding lone parent&rsquo;s benefit and so on, that is required in the interests of the child.  That may be a debate for another day.</P>
      
        <P>It is an important debate.  I support Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s amendments.  Amendment No. 72, in my name, addresses a slightly different situation.  As it is approaching 1 p.m. I will wait until the next occasion to speak to it.  What I am speaking about is the rights of people, previously involved with a child, to some possibility of access following the adoption order.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce to the House today the Second Stage of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.  The Bill has several purposes.  Its main purpose is to give further effect to the Government&rsquo;s cancer control strategy and, in particular, the development of radiation oncology services under the national plan for radiation oncology.  The plan will result in the expansion of public radiation oncology services, integrated with surgical and medical oncology.  It includes the integration of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Rathgar, into the HSE&rsquo;s national cancer control programme.  Accordingly, this Bill dissolves the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and transfers the hospital and its staff to the HSE.</P>
        <P>Deputies will recall that the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provided for the integration of the national cancer screening service into the national cancer control programme.  Cancer screening is an intrinsic component of cancer control and integrating it into the cancer programme ensures that services and resources in the fight against cancer are co-ordinated.  Similarly, the provision of radiation oncology services is an intrinsic component of cancer treatment.  The Bill makes provision for the integration of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital into the HSE&rsquo;s cancer programme as in the case of last year&rsquo;s legislation for the cancer screening service.</P>
        <P>The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 also provides for the discontinuance of the infectious diseases maintenance allowance originally introduced in 1947.  Currently, no person is in receipt of this allowance and there are in place a number of other schemes through which financial and other supports are provided to such persons.  Finally, the Bill contains a number of minor technical amendments.  First, it makes technical amendments to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 and the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 to assist in the interpretation of these Acts.  Second, it makes a technical amendment to the Health Act 2007 which relates to decisions taken under section 55 of that Act.  Third, it makes textual amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to correct typographical errors.  I propose now to give an overview of the main policy areas of the Bill and then to set out its provisions in more detail.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s national cancer control programme, NCCP, was established and approved by Government in 2007 to give effect to the National Cancer Control Strategy 2006.  The strategy sets out the future framework for delivery of cancer treatment in Ireland.  It also endorses the national plan for radiation oncology which had been approved by Government in 2005. <Col N="615"/> Implementation of the programme involves the transfer of diagnostic, surgical and radiation oncology services to designated centres, each with a critical mass of expertise, sufficient throughput of cases and a high concentration of multi-disciplinary specialist skills.  This approach is supported by international evidence which demonstrates that the concentration of cancer services in large volumes in specialist centres produces superior outcomes.</P>
        <P>The re-organisation of breast cancer diagnosis and surgery into the eight cancer centres has been the most high profile aspect of the work of the cancer programme to date.  This has been a significant and a challenging task.  Its completion late last year marked a major milestone for the cancer programme.  HIQA&rsquo;s assessment of the symptomatic breast cancer services in February this year found that all the fundamentals are now in place in the eight centres to ensure safe, quality care for patients, which is very positive confirmation of the progress that has been made.</P>
        <P>Considerable progress has also been made on services for other cancers.  An important development is the establishment in each of the eight centres of rapid access diagnostic clinics for lung and prostate cancers.  These clinics will speed up access to diagnosis and multi-disciplinary decision-making for patients whose symptoms are indicative of these cancers.  So far, we have six lung clinics and five prostate clinics and the remainder are due to be established this year.</P>
        <P>Good progress is also being made on the re-organisation of surgical services for pancreatic and rectal cancer.  There will be one national centre for pancreatic cancer surgery at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin, while rectal cancer surgery will be carried out in each of the eight centres.  The community oncology programme is a more low profile aspect of the cancer programme&rsquo;s work but an extremely important one.  The major focus of this programme is to create capacity and knowledge among health professionals in the community to promote best practice in cancer control.  These initiatives are all part of the overall implementation of the cancer control strategy.</P>
        <P>Demand for cancer services, including radiation oncology, will continue to increase in the coming years as the population ages.  The 2003 report of the expert group, known as the Hollywood report, recommended the development of a clinical network of large centres.  The national plan for radiation oncology was approved by Government in 2005 and was, as I have already stated, endorsed in the 2006 cancer control strategy.  Its aim is to provide new or additional radiation oncology facilities in four cancer centres, namely, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Galway.  There will also be satellite facilities at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, and at Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the plan is under the governance of the cancer control programme and is well under way.  Construction of new facilities at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont Hospitals will be completed this year.  When the new facilities come on stream, they will increase radiotherapy capacity significantly.  We will have 12 linear accelerators in the public system in the eastern area as compared to only eight now.  St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Rathgar, is the largest provider and the most specialist centre for radiotherapy in Ireland, with an international reputation.  The two new facilities at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s will come together with St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to form the St. Luke&rsquo;s Radiation Oncology Network.  The new facilities will be under the governance of the cancer programme.</P>
        <P>To facilitate the establishment of the St. Luke&rsquo;s network, the then director of national cancer control programme, Professor Tom Keane, advised that there should be a single governance model and that therefore St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital should also come under the governance of the cancer programme.  St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital board was established by statutory instrument in 1999 <Col N="616"/>as a voluntary hospital under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961.  Providing for the effective delivery of radiation oncology services as a fully integrated component of the cancer control programme is the main purpose of this Bill.  Accordingly, the Bill provides for the dissolution of the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s and the transfer of St. Luke&rsquo;s staff and facilities to the HSE.</P>
        <P>This means that all staff of the new network will be employees of the HSE and not of any individual hospital.  This will facilitate the transfer of employees between locations, subject of course to the usual industrial relations mechanisms.  It will allow for a single referral facility, a single management structure and shared support services across all three sites.  Additional development funding and 54 posts have been provided to the cancer programme this year for the new centres.  In addition to these, some staff and resources will transfer from St. Luke&rsquo;s to the new centres in the second half of this year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2014, when the national plan for radiation oncology will have been completed and further capacity will have been developed at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont, all remaining staff and resources will transfer from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital or Beaumont Hospital and radiotherapy will no longer be provided at St. Luke&rsquo;s.</P>

	<P>On a point of order, a copy of the Minister&rsquo;s script is normally circulated to Members if the Minister is reading from one.  Are copies of the script available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea)</NameTxt>
	<P>We have not received copies of it yet.  I take it they are on way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>They are.  Apologies for that.</P>
        <P>From 2014, therefore, all publicly-funded radiotherapy services in Ireland will be provided as part of an integrated multidisiplinary service involving surgical, medical and radiation oncology.  This is in keeping with the recommendations of the Hollywood report.</P>
        <P>That there has been great loyalty and support for the hospital over the years from patients and their families who have experienced the services of St. Luke&rsquo;s and also from staff and from the wider community.  St. Luke&rsquo;s has combined technical excellence with outstanding patient care.  The commitment, expertise, tradition and ethos of the hospital and its staff should not be lost when services move from the site itself in a number of years from now.  This was acknowledged by Government in 2005 when it approved the plan.</P>
        <P>With the establishment of the St. Luke&rsquo;s network, we have a duty to ensure that the less tangible but immensely valuable aspects of St. Luke&rsquo;s are as much part of the provision of the new services as its more tangible resources.  Staff can play a key role here and therefore it is to be welcomed that St. Luke&rsquo;s staff will be in place in all three centres in the network from its establishment.</P>
        <P>As many people will be aware, there are organisations that are closely associated with St. Luke&rsquo;s but that are at the same time separate entities.  They are not encompassed within this legislation, nor should they be.  My Department has liaised closely with the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s on the future of these organisations &mdash; the St. Luke&rsquo;s Institute of Cancer Research and the St. Luke&rsquo;s Cancer Research Fund.  The focus of both these entities is on cancer research and the continued development of expertise and knowledge and there is widespread agreement that this should continue into the future.  I understand that the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s is taking the necessary steps to ensure that these organisations continue to have legally sound structures following the enactment of this legislation and I very much welcome this.</P>
        <P>I also want to mention the significant work that has been done by the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital over many years.  To date, I understand that the friends of the hospital have raised <Col N="617"/>more than &euro;26 million in funds for various projects within the hospital.  The friends of the hospital have been a major force in fundraising for radiation oncology services over the years and I understand that those involved wish to ensure that the great goodwill and support for St. Luke&rsquo;s in the community can continue to benefit cancer patients into the future.</P>
        <P>Another key policy area of the Bill relates to the reallocation of certain functions from the health sector to the Department of Social Protection.  The Government decided some time ago that in order to increase the effectiveness of the health service generally, it was important that the service concentrated fully on addressing its core health objectives.  Accordingly it was felt that there could be scope to transfer certain functions out of the health service and locate them more appropriately within other Departments.</P>
        <P>The subsequent Core Functions of the Health Service Report 2006 found that there were a number of schemes which were seen to be more income supports than personal social services.  A number of implementation groups were set up to carry out the transfer of functions.  One of these, the interdepartmental group on non-supplementary welfare allowance payments, was given specific responsibility to examine the transfer of income supports to the Department of Social Protection.  A total of 25,000 domiciliary care allowance cases transferred from the HSE to that Department in 2009.  In this context the infectious diseases maintenance allowance, IDMA, was examined by the group.  The IDMA was originally introduced in 1947 for a specified list of diseases, including TB.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a situation where policy is moving towards mainstreaming supports for people with a disability, the sustainability of a separate income support payment for a prescribed set of diseases must be questioned.  The group found that the key objectives of the scheme were now met by other allowances, in particular the disability allowance and supplementary welfare allowance.  The incidence of the specified infectious diseases has been steadily declining and the number of people in receipt of the allowance in 2009 was fewer than 20.  The group therefore decided to ask the HSE to examine the small number in receipt of the allowance with a view to establishing their eligibility and suitability for transfer to the appropriate equivalent Department of Social Protection.</P>
        <P>The HSE completed its examination of the small number of recipients in 2009.  It found that some were no longer eligible for the allowance and others were suitable for transfer to the appropriate Department of Social Protection.  It should be noted that the weekly payment rates for this allowance, the supplementary welfare allowance and the disability allowance were the same and therefore those who transferred to a new payment were not disadvantaged.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed my Department that no one is currently in receipt of this maintenance allowance and there are no applications or appeals on hand.  Therefore, it has been decided to remove the infectious disease maintenance allowance from statute by repealing section 44 of the Health Act 1947 and section 36(2) of the Health Act 1953.</P>
        <P>I will refer to the principal features of the Bill.  Part 1, comprising sections 1 to 4, inclusive, contains standard provisions dealing with the Short Title, commencement, definition and expenses.  Section 3 removes the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s duty to provide an infectious diseases maintenance allowance and also revokes the St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Board (Establishment) Order 1999.  Parts of the legislation will come into operation by ministerial order and different provisions will be brought into operation at different times.</P>
        <P>I will deal with the specific provisions of the Bill that relate to St. Luke&rsquo;s, that is, Part 2 of the Bill, sections 5 to 13, inclusive.  Section 5 provides for the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to be dissolved.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides for the transfer of land and other property of St. Luke&rsquo;s to the HSE.  The Bill also includes a provision that the site may not be disposed of in any way without the <Col N="618"/>permission of the Minister.  Many people will be familiar with the location of St. Luke&rsquo;s and the attractive grounds of the hospital.  How this site may be used in the future will be on many people&rsquo;s minds.  I understand that the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s and the board have been considering the future use of the hospital after 2014 and I understand that proposals will be submitted to me in the near future in this regard.  I look forward to receiving these proposals.  I have previously stated that I believe St. Luke&rsquo;s has a future within the public health service and I will consult with the friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s, the HSE and other interested parties on how the site could best be used for the benefit of patients.</P>
        <P>Sections 7, 8 and 9 are standard provisions dealing with the transfer of rights and liabilities of St. Luke&rsquo;s board to the HSE, the preservation of contracts and pending legal proceedings.</P>
        <P>Section 10 relates to the transfer of St. Luke&rsquo;s staff to the HSE.  The transfer of staff is being done to support the future provision of radiation oncology services within a network model.  For staff, some of whom will transfer to other sites in the network at the end of this year, and some of whom will remain at St. Luke&rsquo;s for a number of years to come, this provision provides certainty as regards their future conditions of employment.  All current employees of St. Luke&rsquo;s at the date of transfer will become employees of the HSE on conditions and pay that are no less beneficial than those that they currently have.  Superannuation benefits and reckonable service will also transfer with the employees.  Furthermore, the Bill provides that the pension liabilities of St. Luke&rsquo;s will now become the pension liabilities of the HSE.  This Bill therefore provides certainty about the future for pensioners of St. Luke&rsquo;s also.  These provisions are similar to those under which the national screening service staff transferred to the HSE in April of this year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sections 11, 12 and 13 are standard provisions dealing with the transfer of records and the preparation of a final report and final accounts of St. Luke&rsquo;s Board for submission to the Minister and the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Part 3 of the Bill, sections 14 to 17, deal with various miscellaneous technical and textual amendments.  Section 14 updates the definition of &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 to reflect the new legal framework for the regulation of nursing homes, namely the Health Act 2007.  Section 15 is a technical amendment to the Health Act 2007 to enable a decision by a chief inspector of social services to take immediate effect in cases where the registered provider or applicant informs the chief inspector that he or she accepts the decision.  Section 16 makes textual amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act to correct typographical errors.  Section 17 updates the definition of &ldquo;proprietor&rdquo; in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act to reflect the new legal framework for the regulation of nursing homes.  It also amends the definitions of &ldquo;allowable deduction&rdquo; and &ldquo;minimum retained income threshold&rdquo; to ensure that they take account of situations where both members of a couple enter long-term residential care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The contribution of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital board and its staff to the provision of cancer services has been immense.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge this contribution and to thank the board members, the management and staff for their commitment and dedication.     It is also very important to say that the board has provided great support and co-operation for the process of integration into the cancer programme.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the ethos and sense of professionalism, which is so much a part of St. Luke&rsquo;s, contributing to the continued successful implementation of the cancer control programme and in particular the new St. Luke&rsquo;s radiation oncology network.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, which provides for the dissolution of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital board and the transfer of its employees, assets and liabilities to the Health Service Executive. It is important to note that this Bill also provides for the amendment of the Health Acts 1947 and 1953 to discontinue the infectious diseases maintenance allowance, about which the Minister has informed us, and provides for technical amendments to the Health Nursing Home Act 1990, the Health Act 2009 and the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009.</P>
        <P>For more than 55 years,  St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, in the Dublin suburb of Rathgar, has been caring for cancer patients from all over Ireland.  Since its formal opening in May 1954, hundreds of thousands of patients and their families have been through its doors and experienced the excellent care that the hospital and its staff have provided at its unique site at Oakland.</P>
        <P>I echo the Minister&rsquo;s praise for the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and for the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s who have contributed so much and raised so many funds over the years.  I would be very concerned that the wonderful ethos that exists in that hospital should continue into and infect our general oncology services.   I must put it to the Minister that the HSE has not had that ethos at its centre.  I shall refer to that later in terms of people&rsquo;s experiences.  The progression of today&rsquo;s Bill reminds us of the many changes that have taken place in the provision of cancer care services since the publication of the Cancer Care Strategy in 2006.</P>
        <P>This Bill reminds us of individuals such as Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley and Susie Long who brought the failings of our cancer services to the nation&rsquo;s attention.  The late, very brave Susie Long paid far too high a price for the dysfunctional system of our cancer services.  The passing of this Bill also reminds us of the situation in Portlaoise where 97 women needed to be recalled after their ultrasounds were reviewed and were left waiting for contact until a sufficient &ldquo;cohort&rdquo; of files was reached.  What on earth was meant by that?  One still wonders but what I found repugnant about it, and what the people of this country found repugnant, was that a health service could form the view that it would deal with people when it felt it was appropriate, in terms of a magic number arbitrarily decided by somebody, as to when it would be worth its while to deal with women, some of whom transpired to have cancer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When we think of that ethos we think of the north east where the people, having had 6,000 X-rays and ultrasounds performed on 4,500 of the population, needed to have those re-examined because of a question mark over the competence of the individual who initially read them.  Despite knowing in September 2007 there was a problem, this HSE system took no action until May 2008.  Several people died.  We do not know whether their demise was unavoidable in any event but to make a cold callous decision of that nature is something abhorrent to me, as a doctor and as an Irish citizen.  Therefore, I hope our new cancer centres will absorb and embrace the excellent ethos of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital which always looked at patients from an holistic perspective, not looking only to their radiological and oncological needs but also looking to their social needs and had the ability to provide them with an experience that would mimic the home as much as possible.  That ethos is what makes St. Luke&rsquo;s so famous and such a success.  Rarely have I heard patients complaining about St. Luke&rsquo;s.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the rest of our services.</P><Col N="620"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister alluded to colonoscopy and bowel cancer screening.  These are to be welcomed.  At the beginning of 2009, the Minister instructed the HSE to ensure that patients needing an urgent colonoscopy should not have to wait more than four weeks following referral from their general practitioner.  More than a year later, high numbers of patients continue to wait excessive lengths of time for colonoscopies.  The Irish Cancer Society recently reported there are 951 people waiting more than three months for a colonoscopy.  That data were provided to the Irish Cancer Society by the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  As the Minister well knows, the consequences of long waiting times for these tests can be fatal, as they were for the late and very brave Susie Long.  We must sort this out or there will be more unnecessary deaths.</P>
        <P>Last January, the Minister announced the roll-out of a colorectal cancer screening programme for people aged between 60 and 69.  However, this programme will not commence until 2012, in selected hospitals. As the Minister knows, colorectal cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and women in Ireland, with approximately 2,200 new cases diagnosed every year and of which approximately 1,000 people die.  Given the seriousness of the illness Fine Gael looks for an earlier roll-out of the programme and the immediate expansion of this programme to younger age groups.  To wait until 2012 does not seem reasonable when this disease is such a major killer of Irish people,  men and women alike.</P>
        <P>I believe a real opportunity has been missed in regard to colonoscopy.  Colonoscopy is a procedure that can be carried out safely in an outpatient setting.  We all understand the need to provide more care in the primary care community setting rather than in hospitals, where appropriate.  Therefore, the fact that only hospitals are applying for the additional colonoscopy capacity rather than primary care centres being encouraged to do so is a huge missed opportunity.  There is no reason that these procedures could not be carried out in major primary care centres.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to embark on a long dissertation on the lack of progress in the roll-out of the primary care strategy which was announced in 2001 and has delivered so little to date.  When we are planning new services we should look to where they can be provided most cost effectively and conveniently for patients.  I believe this is the case with colonoscopy.</P>
        <P>I will provide a context for where we stand.  Demographically, we are heading for a great increase in the number of people aged over 85 years of age.  By 2021 the numbers will more than double from the present figures, as will the age group between 74 and 84 and 65 to 74.  If memory serves me correctly, today&rsquo;s figure is 510,000 people aged over 65 years.  By 2021 this will have risen to more than 900,000.  Unfortunately, there will be more cancers because, as people live longer they are more likely to develop the disease.  We need early intervention because the country will go broke if we do not change the way we are delivering health care.  As much as possible, this should be delivered through primary care which is cost effective and convenient for patients.</P>
        <P>This morning I had the pleasure of launching a book by Joe Ahern and John Whelton, &ldquo;Applying &ldquo;Lean&rdquo; to Healthcare&rdquo;, based on  the Toyota manufacturers&rsquo; new approach to creating efficiencies in their factories.  It has been applied to health care in Ireland and abroad, and I have two examples.  The metabolic lab in Temple Street hospital has, through reorganisation of people&rsquo;s work and where equipment was placed, reduced a 30-day turnaround to five days.  That was without any new tests or modalities.  As we are talking about cancer services, the oncology unit in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital used the lean approach and significantly improved patient satisfaction ratings, service to patients and efficiency.  We will need more of that in future, along with close scrutiny of how we deliver care and the various players &mdash; front line and others &mdash; operate together in their work.</P><Col N="621"/>
        <P>I am a fan of treating the patient at the lowest level of complexity that is timely and safe.  To put this simply, we do not want to see nurses taking blood samples when phlebotomists should be doing it, GPs taking blood pressure readings when nurses could do it or consultants reading ECGs when GPs can do it.  It is about appropriate services from appropriate clinicians.  As the Minister knows, 800 pharmacists have been trained by the Royal College of Surgeons to deliver safe adult vaccines.  Vaccination programmes in America and many other places are run on such a basis so there is a whole new role for other members of primary care teams.</P>
        <P>There was an excellent programme in St. Mary&rsquo;s orthopaedic hospital in Cork, which is mooted to be closed with the physiotherapy unit to be shoehorned into a very small space in the South Infirmary.  Its study, which replicated one in England, showed that the number of referrals to consultant surgeons could be reduced by 40% if patients were given appropriate physiotherapy and exercises.  There are many ways to improve the way we deliver care and we must consider the matter.  According to the VHI, the health bill will be &euro;37 billion by 2021.  Although I do not necessarily accept the figure, it sparks a necessary public debate nonetheless.</P>
        <P>The main provision of this Bill is the dissolution of the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  It is a statutory body funded by the HSE and is currently the largest provider of radiation oncology services in Ireland.  The Minister has told us two new radiotherapy centres at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont will open at the end of 2010 under phase one of the national plan for radiation oncology.  It is important to note that the full network of radiation oncology services as promised under the national network for radiation oncology was supposed to be rolled out by 2011 but, like so much else, this will not happen and the deadline has been extended to 2015.</P>
        <P>In July 2005, the Government announced a decision to move the services at St. Luke&rsquo;s to the site of St. James&rsquo;s Hospital as part of the national radiotherapy network.  Radiotherapy services will continue to be delivered at St. Luke&rsquo;s until at least 2014, when additional capacity is scheduled to come on stream under phase two of the national plan for radiation oncology.  On this occasion, I congratulate the Minister on not doing away with the existing service before the new service comes on stream, as has happened in so many places like the mid-west and others.</P>
        <P>We need this capacity as our general capacity in the health service is creaking at the seams.  I raised earlier the fact that 52 beds have been closed in Beaumont, which is one of the proposed centres.  We were told today that 60 beds are to be closed in the Mater, a surgical ward closed in Cavan, beds were closed in Portlaoise and Roscommon and there has been a major bed closure in Portiuncula.  The bottom line is that patients cannot access the service; it does not just come down to numbers and figures.</P>
        <P>I was informed today by a colleague of a female patient in her 40s who attended a Dublin hospital in December last year.  She was kept in the accident and emergency department for two days, having been advised that she needed to be admitted to the hospital because of a serious heart arrhythmia, which is an irregular heartbeat.  That predisposes her to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest.</P>
        <P>After 48 hours in the accident and emergency department, she was informed there was no bed and she could not be admitted.  She was sent home on medication and advised she would get an early appointment.  That early appointment is for 13 August this year.  The lady is experiencing symptoms and has been back and forth to her GP and the accident and emergency department.  This is no way to treat people.  The woman continues to be at risk and may need a surgical procedure, which is why she was to be admitted.  This illustrates a broken health service that is not working or delivering.</P>
        <P>The excellence in the service provided at St. Luke&rsquo;s is about staff attitude to the patient and people in general, seeing the patient as a person rather than a number at the bottom of a page. <Col N="622"/> I hope that ethos will be taken up by broader HSE services but this will not be possible if the capacity does not exist.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the north-east region earlier.  Hospitals such as the Mater and Beaumont, along with Cavan, have been affected and the facility in Monaghan is gone.  Services are being shoehorned through Drogheda to the Dublin hospitals which cannot cope.  They do not have enough beds but we cannot reduce emergency admissions by 33,000 when we do not have the facilities in the community to prevent those emergencies from developing.  We will probably see more emergencies developing as people wait longer for elective surgery without getting it.  A problem which may be treatable in an elective planned fashion could become an emergency, and everybody in the House knows that when there is emergency surgery, the chances of an optimum outcome are reduced when compared to planned surgery.</P>
        <P>I would appreciate if the Minister could arrange for a briefing on progress of the wider radiation oncology plan.  It is important that we know what progress has been made, when it will be completed, how much it will cost and what the funding will be, etc.  I recently read that 79 posts in the cancer control service earmarked for the development of planned radiation oncology services can only be filled if a similar number of posts of equivalent salary value are suppressed elsewhere.  Will the Minister assure us the suppressed posts will not be from the front line?  We would appreciate clarity on this important matter.</P>
        <P>Another issue of particular interest to me and others, and which has been raised in the House recently, is the regulation and control of the use of sunbeds, which we know can cause skin cancer.  We are back to trying to prevent rather than cure the disease.  We know sunbeds are a real risk, particularly if there is exposure during childhood.  Unless we act, more young people will be at risk of developing cancer through prolonged use of sunbeds.  We know much education is needed to inform people of the dangers, as people want girls in particular to look well on days such as when they celebrate first holy communion.  Children are being exposed unnecessarily and recklessly so we must legislate on the matter.  We have a duty of care to our children.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister indicate when the legislation on sunbed use will be introduced?  She launched the strategy for cancer control in 2006 and this legislation was part of it.  In the past number of years we have seen a rapid increase in the number of tanning centres and as people are not aware of the dangers we must take positive action.</P>
        <P>I will finish by commending the fantastic work done in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  I also commend the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, who have raised so much funding and been at the sharp end of leading the way in radiation oncology.  I would have no problem with supporting the Bill, but I warn that we must protect the ethos that made St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital so successful.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the important Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010, which provides for the dissolution of the St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital board and the transfer of its employees, assets and liabilities to the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Reilly stated, for more than 50 years St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in the Dublin suburb of Rathgar has been caring for cancer patients from all over Ireland and thousands of patients have experienced the excellent care it delivers.  Staff and patients at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital have campaigned for a number of years on the grounds that this move would not be in the best interests of the patients it treats.  Apart from the intention to move off-site in 2014, we know little more about the hospital&rsquo;s projected future.  Given that this matter is of particular interest to patients and staff, perhaps the Minister could inform the House about what decision has been made regarding the future use of the site and its facilities.</P><Col N="623"/>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of cancer services.  It was disappointing to read in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> an apology from the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady.  Information she read out in the D&aacute;il three weeks ago suggested that Clare County Council had required planning permission for the location of a mobile digital screening unit in Ennis.  This gave the impression that Clare County Council had been responsible for the delay in the provision of breast screening, which was incorrect and unfair to the council&rsquo;s staff and members.  Planning permission was not required at any time by the council.  Indeed, it has provided a site for the mobile unit, but the service has not arrived.  In the 2001 national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, the Government promised that programmes for breast and cervical cancer screening would be extended nationally.  Almost ten years later, this has still not happened.</P>
        <P>At the end of March, Fine Gael Deputy Joe Carey asked the Minister for Health and Children the position regarding the roll-out of BreastCheck to County Clare.  Conveniently and as regularly occurs, the Minister was unable to respond due to industrial action.  Perhaps she will take the opportunity when replying to clarify the status of BreastCheck in County Clare.  Given the facts that there is a site, planning permission is not required and the Government promised to roll out BreastCheck, why has this not been done?</P>
        <P>Regarding the radiation oncology plan, in early April we learned of a dispute between the HSE and management at the UPMC Whitfield Clinic in Waterford.  According to the managing director of UPMC, the HSE failed to renew the contract on radiotherapy services, which expired at the end of December 2009.  UPMC tried to put a new agreement in place that would have offered improved services at reduced rates but it failed to get any meaningful response from the HSE.  It was not until this issue hit the headlines that the HSE seemed willing to engage on a new service level agreement.  I understand that discussions have been held.  Perhaps the Minster could confirm whether this process has concluded and agreement been reached.  If not, how will the issue be progressed and how long will it be before completion?</P>
        <P>I was relieved when the Minister reversed her decision on the cervical cancer vaccine.  This is a matter on which Fine Gael and Deputy Reilly in particular campaigned for a number of months.  Fine Gael welcomes the long-awaited commencement of the cervical cancer vaccination plan, but more detail is required.  My colleagues in Fine Gael and I would like more detail from the Minister about the HSE&rsquo;s plan, breaking down which students will be vaccinated in May and which in September and providing more information on the decision to vaccinate some girls in schools and some in special clinics.  It is important that we get the implementation right.  Poor uptake, as has been the case in other jurisdictions, will fail to protect the maximum number of girls and represent poor value for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy Reilly, I urge the Minister to prepare and implement legislation on the regulation of sunbeds.  This was a recommendation within the national cancer control programme of 2006.  Years have passed but little has been done.  Action in this regard would have a clear benefit in helping to reduce the cause of cancer.  The measure would have long-term benefits for the health service, in that it would reduce costs.</P>
        <P>I compliment and highlight the contribution of the board and staff of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to the provision of cancer services.  As the Minister stated, their contribution has been significant.  I thank current and former board members, management and staff for their commitment and dedication.  As the Minister also stated, the board has provided considerable support for and co-operation with the process of integration into the cancer programme.  However, concern has been expressed in certain areas of the country regarding services for cancer patients after they leave the hospital.  Sligo was highlighted to me as being one such area.  Patients coming from Galway believe they have inadequate after-care services.  After-care services are not consist<Col N="624"/>ently bad throughout the State but in some areas they are less than adequate for the continuing care and rehabilitation of people following cancer treatment.</P>

	<P>It is with a sense of sadness that we discuss the change of the role St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin, which has been caring for cancer patients from all over Ireland for more than 50 years.  I understand it was founded by the then Cancer Association of Ireland in 1954.  No family in Ireland has not had some experience of the care provided by St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  My family experienced it, since my father attended the hospital.  His care was excellent.  When people discuss the hospital, they are referring to its atmosphere and air of tranquility more than anything else.  There is a sense that someone is cared for as a human being as opposed to as a number going through the system.  Families were involved in everything.  I was reading through some of the documentation that we got from the library in preparation for this Bill and I came across quotes from people who were involved in the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and various other protests.  They talk about that ethos as being part of what St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital represents in the minds of the Irish population.  My mother used to get a letter twice a year from a lady whose husband was in St. Luke&rsquo;s at the same time as my father.  They maintained that friendship and contact for many years afterwards.  That is a snapshot of the way in which St. Luke&rsquo;s cared for people and for the families of people who were in there because they had cancer.  That is the ethos that all of us in this House and the people of Ireland want to see preserved.  We are right to be sceptical that this might not happen in the future plans for the hospital.</P>
        <P>We understand that times move on and that we have to use resources well.  In spite of what the Minister might say sometimes, we all supported the cancer strategy.  We had one doubt about it, which was the fact that there was no centre north of a line between Galway and Dublin.  By and large, the Government got the kind of support from the Opposition on the cancer strategy that I feel would not have happened if it came from the other side of the House.  It must be acknowledged that we all want better outcomes for patients, which is why we largely supported the ethos of the national cancer strategy.  This move today is a part of that, and St. Luke&rsquo;s will be part of a wider network of care for patients who have cancer in that part of the Dublin region.</P>
        <P>We will now have four main centres, plus two ancillary centres in Waterford and Limerick.  We all hope that will produce better outcomes for cancer patients, because the statistics are quite stark.  The National Cancer Registry statistics show that between 2005 and 2007, an annual average of 27,023 new cancers was registered.  Apart from non-melanoma skin cancer, the most common cancers were prostate cancer at 2,462 cases, breast cancer at 2,335 cases, colorectal cancer at 2,156 cases and lung cancer at 1,118 cases.  The risk of developing cancer was roughly 6.6 per 1,000 persons per year over the two year period in question.  Our wish is that those statistics be addressed primarily through screening, early detection and prevention.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that we pretty much have BreastCheck all over the country now, and we will have colorectal screening within a couple of years.  Like Deputy Neville, I was aware of the situation in Clare.  I do not understand why that issue arose in respect of planning.  I was screened from a mobile van in the grounds of a premises owned by the HSE in Limerick.  The procedure was perfectly fine for me and for my neighbours, so it is unfortunate that there was a glitch in the roll out, because Clare is the last county to be incorporated in the plans.  I was <Col N="625"/>in the House when the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, made her statement a couple of days ago, and it is to be regretted.  Overall, there is no doubt that we are making progress.</P>
        <P>I support the calls by Deputy Reilly and Deputy Neville for the Minister to tell us that we are on schedule for the roll out of colorectal screening in accordance with the plans that have been outlined to us.  There were 952 people waiting for more than three months for a colonoscopy in the most recent statistics.  That is directly at variance with the specific plans of the Minister in respect of access.  When she signed the most recent consultants&rsquo; contract, one of her aims was to ensure that there would be no difference in waiting times between public and private patients for colonoscopies.  That is welcome and we remember the tragic story of Susie Long that was put into the public domain.  At the beginning, she did not use her own name, but eventually she did.  If she had been diagnosed earlier, she would have had a better prognosis for the outcome of her case.</P>
        <P>While the Minister has said that there will be no difference between public and private patients in respect of waiting times, the reality is completely different.  Private patients can go to private hospitals and clinics to have colonoscopies carried out and can then access the service sooner than public patients.  That is the reality of the world in which live.  Private patients make appointments every day and are seen within a short period of time.</P>
        <P>We need a system of health care in this country where everybody is treated on the basis of need.  We need it especially in respect of early diagnosis of killer diseases like cancer.  There should be no difference between public and private patients in the diagnosis.   If somebody needs a diagnosis, then he or she should get it.  If there are symptoms of colorectal cancer, then the person should get in as quickly as possible to have a colonoscopy if that what the person&rsquo;s GP considers to be the best option.  It is not within the capacity of GPs to decide that one person is urgent and another person is not urgent.  If the GP sees symptoms, he or she will want that person to have the diagnosis.</P>
        <P>I want to express my concern about the future of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and Deputy Quinn will continue in that vein because of his own experience of people who live near the hospital.  We do not know anything about the future use of the site and we have not been given any undertaking on that use.  We need to provide certainty that the site will be retained for health purposes.  It is being transferred to the ownership of the HSE, as are the staff and the resources, but we need to know that the site will be retained for health purposes.  There are many health needs in this city and across the country, and I would like the Minister to give us that kind of undertaking today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be retained for those purposes.  I am awaiting their proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  She said in her own contribution that she has engaged with the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s and is waiting to hear from them.  Maybe she can give us a clearer picture when she replies.</P>
        <P>I have doubts and concerns because I am familiar with reconfiguration.  It is happening in my own region.  In spite of all the assurances given to us that there would be full resources available at the Mid-West Regional Hospital before services closed in Ennis and Nenagh, services have already closed in Ennis and Nenagh and further services will close in July but the critical care unit that was promised, the kind of resources needed by the accident and emergency department and the extra beds are not in Limerick yet.  In fact, beds are being closed as they are being closed in other parts of the country.  We were given all these undertakings that reconfiguration is good for everybody and that hospitals in the network could do more for patients.  The hospitals in Ennis and Nenagh would get day beds and day wards and much more work would be carried out there, but that has not happened either.  Therefore, I am extremely <Col N="626"/>sceptical about promises in respect of the future use of health resources.  It is an issue for other regions as well and people in those regions are beginning to experience what we have already experienced in the mid-west.</P>
     
        <P>It is a huge issue in the north east and I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will address it when he contributes to the debate.  We cannot trust the Government or the HSE to deliver what they undertake.  That is the real problem, particularly so now because there is a shortage of resources.  There are indiscriminate cuts across the board which do not take any account of their effects.  The moratorium is crucifying many of the health services because key people are not being replaced.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Today, we heard that 60 beds are to be closed in the Mater Hospital.  In Beaumont Hospital, 52 have already been closed with other bed closures throughout the country.  More and more patients are not getting into hospitals because the beds are not there.  People are clogged up in accident and emergency departments and on longer outpatient waiting lists.  People in pain and distress are waiting to get access to the health services and that is a direct result of the closure of beds.  The Minister cannot sit there and treat that as an abstract concept.  These are real people with real suffering.  I spoke with a man who recently sat on a hard chair for 15 hours in an accident and emergency department in Dublin with his sick wife.  The real people of Ireland depend on the health service and most of them are public patients who do not have the opportunity to go into the more cushy surroundings of private hospitals.  The Minister for Health and Children cannot stand over that and she needs to engage more in what is happening in the health services.</P>
        <P>The Minister has promised legislation on the control of sunbeds and I understand they are to be banned for those under the age of 18 years.  That legislation is urgently required because those who use sunbeds are usually young women who do not seem to have any understanding whatsoever of the fact that the rays in sunbeds are damaging.  There is real danger that these young women will develop skin cancer as they get older and that is an urgent matter.  I hope the Minister will respond to us on this.</P>
        <P>With regard to other matters, if nobody is claiming the infectious diseases maintenance allowance then none of us has a problem with the fact that it will no longer exist.  Will the Minister clarify the issue of the transfer of functions?  Will the Minister update us on the plan to transfer some of the work of community welfare officers from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection?  There is some concern among community welfare officers about what exactly is happening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the measures on nursing homes in the Bill, I know they are minor amendments and I do not have any particular difficulty with them but other issues arise with regard to nursing home legislation, particularly the time that financial assessment takes.  I believe there was a proviso in the Bill that it would be reviewed after a period of time.  If the Minister is to review it, she should consult as widely as possible beforehand, including with the owners of nursing homes and with the workers in the HSE doing the assessments.  There are difficulties with delays in people being discharged from hospitals because of the time it takes to do some of the financial assessments.  While the Minister told me at one stage that it was all right to move people out even if the full assessment had not been carried out, I am told that no nursing home will take a person if it is not sure that person will qualify under the fair deal because nursing homes are afraid of losing money.  As hospitals are trying to move out of acute beds people who are finished with their care, they cannot do so because the nursing homes will not take them.  There are practical difficulties arising with the legislation and if there is a review the Minister needs to be aware of them.</P><Col N="627"/>
        <P>I pay tribute to everyone involved in St. Luke&rsquo;s since 1954.  I strongly reiterate the importance of retaining the premises for the use in health services and, more important, the ethos.  It has been described as a haven in Rathgar and that is a very good description of what St. Luke&rsquo;s has meant to many families in Ireland over the years.  We need to ensure that type of thinking remains in the care of cancer patients.  Unfortunately, in the life of a busy general hospital or tertiary hospital it is difficult to maintain that so it is important that the units are appropriately designed, laid out and structured and that there are garden and outdoor areas and the sense of calm and peace that patients need.  I do not know how that can be achieved but it is the strong view of people who have experienced what happens in St. Luke&rsquo;s that it should be retained for the families concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, for allowing me to intervene in this debate.  I have seldom spoken on health matters because, quite frankly, I know very little about the medical side of health and I would hate to have to deal with the complexity of the problems in our system.  Therefore, I do not propose to try in any way to second guess those who have put much more effort and consideration into these matters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to offer some observations, from a personal point of view and from a constituency point of view.  I will start with the HSE itself.  I do not think any of us - certainly I did not - opposed the concept of the HSE at the time.  However, I do not think any of those who vigorously proposed its establishment, including the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and the present Minister, would ever have believed it would become the unmanageable monster it now is.  In the course of that transition from inefficient and various health boards to what became an integrated single unit, the credibility of our ability in efficiency terms to deliver an efficient health service, or the perception of that &mdash; and frequently perception is more important than reality &mdash; is that it is a dysfunctional body.</P>
        <P>The Minister proposes to implement the Hollywood report and, as she stated to me in reply to a question in March 2007:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">It is my objective, and that of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to see the earliest delivery of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Radiation Oncology.  I am determined that the HSE will deliver on this Plan in 2011 as originally scheduled.  The HSE and my Department are considering options to speed up the pace of delivery.  This is a challenging timetable and I will provide the HSE with the necessary support to deliver on it.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">As regards the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, my objective is to ensure that these resources are utilised in the best interest of the health services.  I will discuss this issue in due course with the HSE and the Hospital Board.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">At the time, that reply sent shockwaves and fear across the cancer community I encountered who visited St. Luke&rsquo;s on a regular basis and among many of the residents who live there.  I never encountered a resident in the Rathgar area who was worried or upset by the excessive car parking that took place on occasion or gave out about it.  I never encountered a resident who felt his or her privacy or the tranquility of a residential area was marred or disrupted by people walking manifestly sick and dying relatives because of the haven of calm, to use the phrase referred to by Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, that was Rathgar and that still is St. Luke&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let me declare a personal interest.  I am a graduate of cancer treatment and I can still remember, five years on, that extraordinary sense of total inner panic and fear that came right through me when my doctor said to me that one of the six sample tests which took place out in Tallaght was cancerous.  The word &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; for my generation has the same resonance as &ldquo;TB&rdquo; for my parents&rsquo; generation.  The health outcomes, as the Minister knows much better <Col N="628"/>than I do as she has the statistics to hand, are wonderfully positive.  It is not the TB of our generation; it is a curable disease.  We know a great deal about what cures it but a framework and context in which those around one can be reassured is critically important.</P>
        <P>I had my full total body assessment after I went to the consultant when he told me that the first task was to find out if there was any cancer anywhere else in my system.  I went through a long process.  Going to St. Luke&rsquo;s was like going to a religious retreat.  It was not like going to accident and emergency in St. James&rsquo;s.  It was not like trying to find a parking place in the vicinity of St. James&rsquo;s and then negotiating something akin to a bazaar in Istanbul to get to the right place.</P>
        <P>The best architecture in the world will not transform St. James&rsquo;s into a place which will provide the sort of calm which already exists in St. Luke&rsquo;s.  In her speech and in the overall report that has been produced, I understand the Minister is bringing the facilities that were offered by St. Luke&rsquo;s to the National Oncology Centre.  I am sure the medical treatment will be of the best possible quality.  I consulted with some colleagues in my constituency who are medical professionals and they said from a medical point of view the recommendations are the best, but we do not know everything about medicine.  Our present standing in the world does not mean we are the most knowledgeable or that future cohorts of population and expertise will not discover anything new or different.</P>
        <P>We do not know what psychosomatic elements contribute to recovery from prostate cancer for some people and a failure to recover for others.  In sports psychology the whole area of mind over matter is discernible and has been observed but given the limitations of science and knowledge it cannot be quantified.  When I was a young athlete my coach gave me a book which described an incident in a garage in England.  A man who was an athlete and had a young child had a Morris Minor up on a block.  Something happened, the block shifted and the child was trapped under the car.  The man let a roar out of him, bent down and lifted up the Morris Minor to save the child.  When it was all over somebody asked him if he knew what he had just done.  He said, &ldquo;No, is my kid all right?&rdquo;.  The person said, &ldquo;You have just lifted this car.  Try and do it again&rdquo;.  Of course he could not.</P>
        <P>There are aspects of the human condition, physiology and emotional drive that we know about but cannot yet measure.  I am putting to the Minister that what we know but cannot measure is the healing calm that is St. Luke&rsquo;s.  I respectfully suggest, with the comfort of ignorance because I am not a medical scientist, that there are components of the campus in St. Luke&rsquo;s that provide that healing calm.  After the diagnosis in my case, which took place in St. Luke&rsquo;s, I had regular treatment.  I cycled up to St. Vincent&rsquo;s on the Merrion Road at 8 a.m., got my 15 minutes of treatment and came in here on the bus or by bicycle.  It was in July five years ago.  I was the lucky one because I was not very sick as they got it very early.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other people were receiving chemotherapy and serious radiotherapy and had to be driven from different parts of the country.  I met people who flew down from Donegal.  There is a string of bed and breakfasts on the Merrion Road which cater for outpatients of St. Vincent&rsquo;s for that kind of thing.  Where are they going to find that close to St. James&rsquo;s?  The Minister&rsquo;s medical report examined the X-rays and the medical inputs.  It is a one-dimensional world.  They do not travel with a relative who has to come and stay in a bed and breakfast on the Merrion Road.  I ask the people down the road to reconsider and not to throw out the healing haven which is there.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns of Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan regarding undertakings given in all good faith by the Minister, her colleague sitting beside her or the HSE.  Things change and those guarantees cannot necessarily be honoured.  They were not given dishonestly or in bad faith, but things <Col N="629"/>change.  We know that ourselves in our personal and professional lives.  In the answer the Minister gave to me as regards the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke&rsquo;s she said her objective is to ensure the resources are utilised in the best interests of the health service.  What does the health service need?  More cash.  What is the most valuable site in Dublin 6?  St. Luke&rsquo;s.  It was a no-brainer in terms of making a decision to sell the site.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The former leader took great offence to it but the Minister&rsquo;s answer left that charge open.  The best interests of the HSE could have been to realise its capital value and put it into the many areas where capital shortages are hindering her work.</P>
        <P>St. Luke&rsquo;s works for an aspect of the healing care which is associated with the TB of our generation.  We do not know everything; no generation ever will but we think that because we are the current cohort we do know everything.  It is a welcome facility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not often that a facility like St. Luke&rsquo;s is available in a suburban area.  It has the capacity to absorb and maintain the calm that many people, who travel long distances, require.  Frequently the people who are panicking most and are the most fearful are not those who have the disease but the immediate family around them.  We have all experienced that.  That itself can be a cause for additional strain and stress.  St. Luke&rsquo;s has addressed that.</P>
        <P>The Minister should put herself into the picture of travelling five days a week to get to St. James&rsquo;s to get regular radiotherapy treatment and navigate the Luas and car park.  She should come to the Mad Cow roundabout, an area she knows well, and get on the Luas.  She would be stressed out.</P>
        <P>This Bill will be passed.  The decision has been made.  I am sure the medical advice is the best available; I am not disputing that.  However, there are components which cannot be quantified but which can be experienced in St. Luke&rsquo;s.  In view of this I urge the Minister not to throw the baby out with the bath water.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate.  The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 provides for the dissolution of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital board and the transfer of its employees, assets and liabilities to the HSE.  The dissolution, I am told, arises from the national plan for radiation oncology, under which there are to be four radiation oncology centres, two in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway, and two satellite centres in Waterford and Limerick.  I am also advised that the Bill provides for the amendment of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, the Health Act 2007, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009.  It also repeals section 44 of the Health Act 1947 and section 36(2) of the Health Act 1953.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have listened carefully to the last two speakers and I compliment them on their contributions.  I heard Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan comment on calm and peace in regard to hospitals.  In fairness, Deputy Quinn made the same point regarding St. Luke&rsquo;s.  I am glad that we are now in the calm and peace of Thursday afternoon in the D&aacute;il.  One of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rsquo;s colleagues said recently that if the D&aacute;il reaches Thursday it is a good week.  We had an interesting morning and I am glad we are now much more peaceful and calm.</P><Col N="630"/>
        <P>I have a lot of sympathy with the point made by Deputy Quinn regarding the role of St. Luke&rsquo;s and other hospitals.  I am from a bygone Dublin age.  I was born around these parts.  I lived on the corner of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Street and George&rsquo;s Street.  There were many hospitals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>No, funnily enough I was not born and bred in Tallaght.  I was born and bred in the inner city.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I might not be a Deputy today if I had not moved to Tallaght with an employer who was a trustee of the Fine Gael Party but nevertheless saw some potential in me.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>My family were able to go from the inner city to St. Kevin&rsquo;s, which is now St. James&rsquo;s, the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, the Adelaide, Sir Patrick Dun&rsquo;s and Mercer&rsquo;s Hospital, where I had my tonsils removed.  I feel strongly about the cluster of small hospitals, including St. Luke&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>Thank God, I have never been a patient of St. Luke&rsquo;s but I have visited it on many occasions and I agree with Deputy Quinn in regard to its sense of peace and calm and the professional manner in which patients are treated there.  A good friend of mine was a former nurse at the hospital for some of its 56 years and she always told me about the way people were looked after.  I acknowledge the positive contribution it has made to the Dublin region and the entire country over many years.  I assure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that I am a proud Dubliner.</P>
        <P>I intend to speak about my local hospital in the context of this Bill but Deputies need not worry that I will refer to Tallaght for its own sake.</P>

	<P>At the end of May, the Minister for Health and Children announced the appointment of Dr. Susan O&rsquo;Reilly as new director of the National Cancer Control Programme, NCCP.  I understand Dr. O&rsquo;Reilly will take up her position in September.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I look forward to meeting her to discuss her plans.</P>
        <P>I had the opportunity to meet Professor Tom Keane on a number of occasions while he was in charge of the NCCP.  I was always impressed by his professionalism and dedication and I pay tribute to him.  On 29 January, his last day in office, he kindly sent me a long letter regarding cancer control in my own region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have had a long association with Tallaght hospital.  On one occasion, I would not have been reappointed to the hospital planning board if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as the then Minister for Health, had not intervened.  I am proud that I have been a long-term member of the board and I acknowledge the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rsquo;s help in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is important that hospitals such as Tallaght gain a local perspective through the appointment of local people to their boards.  I have raised with the current Minister my concerns about the composition of the board of Tallaght hospital and the proposals for a new board.  I do not wish to imply the people on the board are not doing a good job but it should include a local dimension.</P>
        <P>The Bill before us, which I will support, allows the HSE to take control of St. Luke&rsquo;s hospital.  However, the HSE will not take up its position on the board of Tallaght hospital.  I was a <Col N="631"/>member of the new board when the hospital opened in 1998 and remained on it until I stood down from Dublin County Council in 2003, when I was replaced by my colleague, Jim Daly.  When the HSE was established it decided for its own reasons, perhaps political ones, not to take up its position.  Given its interest in hospitals, I wonder why it took that decision.</P>
        <P>I raised concerns about the processes of the NCCP as they relate to Tallaght hospital.  There was considerable upset and distress in Tallaght, which is the third largest population centre in the country, as well as the wider catchment area, which extends to counties Kildare and Wicklow during the initial stages of the transfer of breast cancer services from Tallaght to St. Vincent&rsquo;s and St. James&rsquo;s.  My priority was to stress to Professor Keane and his colleagues the necessity of ensuring patients from Tallaght would be looked after in the best possible way.</P>
        <P>Deputy McGinley&rsquo;s presence in the Chamber reminds me that, while people from County Donegal have to travel sometimes torturous journeys to get good services, the situation is different in Dublin.  However, as Deputy Quinn noted, people who are unwell can be presented with challenges when crossing the city or worrying about getting the Luas.  As a local Deputy for Tallaght, I will continue to make the case to the HSE and the NCCP that patients who have been treated in Tallaght &mdash; I commend the services provided in my local hospital &mdash; are facilitated in going to other centres.</P>
        <P>Professor Keane&rsquo;s letter states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In relation to the transfer of initial diagnostic and surgical services from Tallaght hospital, the NCCP engaged in a comprehensive and detailed manner with Tallaght, St James&rsquo;s and St Vincent&rsquo;s hospitals in advance of the transfer last year. That engaged explored and agreed the necessary resources that would be required for the two designated cancer centres. The NCCP was in a position to provide significant extra resources through the providing of funding, medical, nursing and support service appointments and the transfer of appropriate resources from Tallaght. We were satisfied in advance that the appropriate services were in place and remain satisfied that both St Vincent&rsquo;s and St James&rsquo;s are providing a quality assured services to all their patients.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The most recent statistics available regarding access demonstrate that both are exceeding independently established standards. The HIQA standards require all eight designated centres to see 95% of urgent patients within two weeks and to see 95% of non urgent patients within twelve weeks.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I want that standard to be maintained and I will continue working to ensure that is the case.  When I have the opportunity to meet Dr. O&rsquo;Reilly, I will advise her of the need to look after those patients who were satisfied with Tallaght hospital.  We must ensure that everything is done in order that they are looked after and further stories do not emerge about appointments being stalled or other problems.</P>
        <P>I compliment the newly appointed chief executive of Tallaght Hospital, Professor Kevin Conlon.  Many Deputies know Professor Conlon and hold him in high regard.  He has a difficult job and must cope with many difficult issues, including cancer services at the hospital.  I wish him well.</P>
        <P>Some months ago, Tallaght Hospital was the focus of much negative publicity concerning X-rays and doctors&rsquo; referral letters.  It was an upsetting time.  Several weeks ago, I and my constituency colleagues, Deputies Pat Rabbitte and Brian Hayes, and the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, met Dr. Maurice Hayes, who is well known to members.  Dr. Hayes, who was appointed to carry out a detailed investigation into events at the hospital, offered many assurances at our meeting.  We asked him to make himself available to patients and families in Tallaght and he did so.  I understand he will hold further meetings.  Dr. Hayes also indicated <Col N="632"/>that he hoped to have his report completed by July and I wish him well in this regard.  The bottom line for me is that public confidence in Tallaght Hospital is restored.  The transfer of cancer services from the hospital, an issue addressed in the Bill, has also affected public morale.</P>
        <P>I understand the process of transferring St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to the Health Service Executive is being completed under the governance of the board of the hospital, which is the largest provider of radiation oncology services in the country.  Radiation oncology is the use of ionising radiation to treat disease and is most commonly delivered using linear accelerator equipment.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the staff of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital who have served the public well since the hospital was established in 1954.  I am not reluctant to admit I remember the year the hospital was founded.  I may have considered Rathgar a different area from my own but I was always happy to pass through it.</P>
        <P>St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital has provided a great service for more than half a century.  Yesterday, I spoke to Deputy Chris Andrews, the local Fianna F&aacute;il Party Deputy for the area, on the changes under way at the hospital.  Not everyone will be pleased about these changes, no more than I was when many inner city hospitals closed in the past.  Many years from now people will wonder why certain hospitals were closed and certain decisions taken.  Two similar cases which I recall from my youth were the closure of Mercer&rsquo;s Hospital and the pulling up of the tram lines in Aungier Street and Georges Street.  Fifty years after those events, one must ask who made these decisions and why were they taken.  I hope, in the years ahead, the decision to transfer services from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will be considered a good one and in the interests of the community.  The jury will be out on that issue for some years.</P>
        <P>I note that Professor Tom Keane strongly advised that St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital be subsumed into the Health Service Executive as soon as possible to facilitate the establishment of an integrated network.  I suspect Professor Keane, who left the position of director of cancer services in January, maintains an interest in this issue.</P>
        <P>The establishment of an integrated network will enable the creation of a single management and clinical governance structure and all staff will become employees of the HSE.  Staff and resources may be shared across the network and there will be a single team of physicists, engineers and other support services for the three centres at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  Some staff and resources at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will transfer to other sites in the network in the second half of this year.</P>
        <P>The provisions in the Bill relating to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital are similar to those contained in the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which transferred other health agencies, including the National Cancer Screening Service board, to the Health Service Executive.  All staff at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will transfer to the HSE under their current terms and conditions.  The pension liabilities of the hospital board will also transfer to the HSE.</P>
        <P>The Department is working closely with the board and management of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and the national cancer control programme to ensure the ethos of the hospital is retained in the new structure.  The involvement of its staff in all centres from the establishment of the network is particularly welcome in that regard.</P>
        <P>Radiography services will continue to be delivered at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital until at least 2014 when additional capacity is scheduled to come on stream under phase two of the national plan for radiation oncology.  At that point, the remaining staff and resources will transfer from the hospital.</P>

        <P>The Bill contains a number of other miscellaneous amendments, including with regard to the infectious diseases maintenance allowance.  I was astonished to learn that no one is currently in receipt of this allowance, which was introduced in 1947.</P><Col N="633"/>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I wish the process of transferring responsibility for St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital well.  It is important that those of us who have the honour and privilege to serve in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann take every opportunity to support the health services.  While I have views and concerns about the manner in which the HSE is operating, those issues should be debated on another day.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response at the conclusion of the debate.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, to pass on my good wishes to the Minister.  I support the Bill.</P>

	<P>I also welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill, the purpose of which is to provide for the dissolution of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital board and the transfer of its employees, assets and liabilities to the Health Service Executive.  Normally, any measure or legislation that improves cancer treatment services is welcome.  Nevertheless, I have mixed views on the Bill because it foresees the closure of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, which has provided excellent cancer treatment for numerous patients over the years.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Connor referred to Donegal.  I visited St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital long before I became a Member of the House.  More than 40 years ago, as a young teacher in Dublin, I used to visit neighbours who were patients at the hospital.  People from my parish and county are receiving the excellent treatment we have come to expect from the excellent facilities in the hospital.    I have seen that hospital develop through the years.  When we went there way back in the 1960s it was just like a country mansion.  There has been much development with new wards and facilities upgraded to turn it into a model hospital.  Attached to the hospital is the excellent hostel provided by the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  Patients who do not need constant care and attention, and are not confined to bed and are only there for the radium treatment have the facilities of the lodge there.  It is just like a four or five-star hotel.  Patients have their own private rooms and kitchen facilities.  Facilities allowing members of the family to stay are also provided.  St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital has provided excellent treatment and facilities for patients through the years.  I often notice the number of people from my county who make a choice to come to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital instead of going to alternative venues.</P>
        <P>The national cancer strategy was launched a number of years ago by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan.  The latest instalment of the strategy is the eight centres of excellence, with three in Dublin.  What is significant about that strategy is that north of a line from Dublin to Galway there is no centre of excellence, which means people from the Ulster counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal and other places to the north must go to Dublin or Galway.  We felt left out at that time and a major campaign was mounted by the Letterkenny General Hospital, which provides cancer services.  It has an excellent oncology unit and has a surgeon who treats breast cancer.  It has a great reputation and has a top-class oncologist.  The only progress to be made is that Letterkenny General Hospital needs to be recognised as a satellite unit to the major centre of excellence in Galway.  That has not been fully developed or got off the ground yet.</P>
        <P>The great controversy and disappointment in the north west is that the very good and worthy cancer treatment facilities in Sligo General Hospital are being phased out.  People in the north west must go to Galway or St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin.  There is a cross-Border dimension and people from the north west have the option of going to Belfast.  That has not been fully developed and in time we expect to have radiation treatment available in a location nearer to Donegal than Belfast, Dublin or Galway.  I understand talks are taking place between the Northern health authorities and our own to have something nearer home, perhaps in Letterkenny or Derry.  We all look forward to that being achieved.</P><Col N="634"/>
        <P>St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital has a great history and as far as Donegal is concerned it is the hospital of choice.  While we welcome the improvement in cancer treatment, nevertheless there is an element of sadness that such a facility that we have come to know and respect so well will be phased out in the next few years.  I understand that by 2014 St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will not be operating as a cancer treatment hospital.  I do not know what will replace it.  If it is as good as St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, we will be happy enough.</P>
        <P>Everyone is interested in the health service and everyone has his or her problems as far as the health service is concerned.  I should avail of this opportunity to dwell on a number of problems in my constituency.  There are developments in Letterkenny General Hospital.  We are getting our new accident and emergency unit, which is at an advanced stage.  I also understand that a number of wards are being provided to increase the inpatient facilities in the hospital and meet the demands for such facilities by the rising population in the county.</P>
        <P>Last Sunday week, public representatives including Members of the Oireachtas attended a protest in Lifford.  The people in Lifford and its catchment area are very concerned over the future of Lifford Community Hospital, which has been established for more than 200 years.  I believe the first hospital opened in Lifford in 1775.  It developed to provide health facilities for the people in its catchment area for 235 years.  I visited Lifford Community Hospital on a few occasions recently and its facilities are very good.  Today it provides residential care for people who need residential care at a community hospital.  It also has a health centre.  It is planned to build a primary health care centre in Lifford on a greenfield site, which is welcome.</P>
        <P>However, we are concerned about what will happen to the residential part of the hospital.  There are a number of options, the first of which is to make investment in it.  It is an old building but could be upgraded.  It is suitable for present day requirements for patients who need that sort of care and attention.  The second option would be to provide a new facility along with the primary health care centre that is being built on a greenfield site.  However, whatever happens, Lifford needs to be looked after.  It is a large catchment area with no other equivalent facility nearby.  It covers east Donegal and the Finn valley.  I hope it will continue to provide the service it is providing.  I make no apologies for mentioning Lifford Community Hospital in the context of cancer services.  I know many people in the last stages of that serious illness find the care and attention they need and to which they are entitled is provided by Lifford Community Hospital.  I had occasion to visit constituents whose time was limited and who were getting excellent care in that hospital.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has stated that a review is taking place.  When I hear the word &ldquo;review&rdquo; in the context of such facilities, the bells begin to ring because a review often means phasing out.  I hope that will not happen at Lifford Community Hospital.</P>
        <P>There are two other hospitals in the south of my constituency in Ballyshannon and Bundoran, the Rock Hospital and the Sheil Hospital.  There were question marks and a review there also.  I believe the crisis has passed there and these facilities, at least the excellent Sheil Hospital which has a long history, will be allowed to continue to provide a service for the people of its catchment area.</P>
        <P>Not alone do the patients from Donegal come to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, but that hospital has always provided a consultant to go to Donegal twice a month to carry out a clinic, which saved people from Donegal having to go the long distance to Dublin for a consultation.  One person in particular, Dr. Healy, used to come from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  I believe he has retired.  He was <Col N="635"/>very well known throughout Donegal and was an excellent consultant.  I understand someone is still continuing the tradition.</P>
        <P>I suppose it is progress that we will have two centres of excellence in Dublin.  The activities in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital will be transferred to Beaumont Hospital and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  It is very sad to see St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital going given all the ancillary facilities it has, including the lodge.  It is in a beautiful location and is like St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  It has lovely grounds and one would not know one was in the heart of the city.  St. Luke&rsquo;s has been like a lung in the city of Dublin.  I do not know what the future holds, but St. Luke&rsquo;s has served its purpose very well down through the years and we appreciate what it has achieved in that time.  Hopefully, its replacement will be just as good.  When the final plans are made, the needs of the north west must be looked after, whether that is in Letterkenny, Sligo or Derry, because it is a long journey to Dublin from Arranmore or Tory Island to Dublin.  That journey takes a lot out of cancer patients travelling for treatment.</P>
        <P>I will now allow my colleague, Deputy Seymour Crawford, the rest of my time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McGinley for sharing his time with me and allowing me to speak on this important issue.  He said he had been visiting St. Luke&rsquo;s for 40 years.  I cannot say I have been doing it as long, but I have been visiting it for a long time.  Many relations and close friends have spent some time in St. Luke&rsquo;s.  I recall something a neighbour of mine who was in St. Luke&rsquo;s 20 years ago said to me.  He was there at a time when the place was not at its best.  He was the owner of a machinery hire company and at this time of year he would have to deal with machines that broke down.  He said to me that if he was cutting silage for somebody and his machine broke down, he would have to get it fixed or hire in a new machine and would not be able, like hospitals, to delay the work or send people home for another week to wait for their cancer treatment.  He pleaded with me, if I was ever in power, to ensure the system was improved.</P>
        <P>I am glad to say that since that time, St. Luke&rsquo;s has improved dramatically.  In the short time Fine Gael was in Government, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, made a major commitment to St. Luke&rsquo;s and it has improved dramatically since then.  Over the years, despite various glips or hitches from time to time, St. Luke&rsquo;s has provided a tremendous service to people from all parts of Ireland, particularly from my part of the country.  In recent years, the lodge at St. Luke&rsquo;s, which was provided by the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s, provided a homely atmosphere where people could relax.  Relaxation is important for people with cancer as tension does not help their situation.  The lodge has provided a great service.  For the past number of years, the matron of St. Luke&rsquo;s has been a lady from my village of Newbliss, County Monaghan.  She has been an example to all her staff on how to deal with patients in what is often a delicate situation.  I wish to pay tribute to all those who down through the years have given service in St. Luke&rsquo;s.  Circumstances for cancer patients are often quite tragic, but thankfully many people now recover from an illness which seemed to be a death sentence some years ago.</P>
        <P>Mention has also been made of St. Anne&rsquo;s Hospital.  I remember my late mother bringing her mother to St. Anne&rsquo;s.  My granny knew everything that was wrong with every patient around her in the hospital, but she never suspected for a second what she was being treated for herself, and she lived to 98 years of age.  She got cancer at 50, but she lived to tell the tale, even at that time.</P>
        <P>I wish the cancer service well.  The Fine Gael Party spokesperson has agreed we must take this route, but personally I am extremely disappointed that St. Luke&rsquo;s is being closed.  I have been concerned with the winding down, if not the closure, of Monaghan General Hospital, so <Col N="636"/>I know what this closure means.  The Minister has given many promises as to what she intends for the service.  I hope those promises will become more of a reality than the promises made to us in Monaghan when the new developments were proposed.  We were told that no services would be removed until a better service had been provided and were told a centre of excellence would be provided before any closures would take place.  We are now in a situation where the Monaghan hospital has been literally wound down and has only 26 beds for rehabilitation and respite, but no extra beds have been provided in either Cavan hospital or the Lourdes hospital in Drogheda.  Both of these hospitals are chock a block, with people on trolleys or being sent home early.  They also have other difficulties.  However, the staff in both hospitals are doing everything they can and if one can gain access to the service, it is a good service.</P>
        <P>The situation in Monaghan provides a warning that it is important that St. Luke&rsquo;s is not closed until Beaumont and St. James are ready and capable of dealing with cancer patients.  Whatever about other illnesses, when people with cancer are held back from getting treatment, they have less chance of surviving their cancer.  When my late mother was in the nursing home in 1999, she was visited in October by her niece.  She said then that if her niece did not receive treatment soon, the treatment would be too late.  My mother was completely blind then, but she knew by feeling her niece&rsquo;s hand and by listening to her breathe that she had a serious illness.  Her niece was diagnosed the following January in a hospital in Northern Ireland and was told by the doctor that if her illness had been caught two months earlier, she could have been saved.  Therefore, it is from personal knowledge and grief as a result of knowing what can happen to a patient if there is a delay in treatment that I make my comments.</P>
        <P>I hope and pray that unlike on other occasions the Minister will deliver on her promises on time so that when St. Luke&rsquo;s is eventually wound down, people will be guaranteed as good a service, if not better, in Beaumont or St. James&rsquo;s.  I cannot pay adequate tribute to St. Luke&rsquo;s for what it did for so many families and patients.  I remember being there when a cousin&rsquo;s daughter, 17 years of age, was being nursed through her final weeks.  The care and attention given to that family by staff at every level was excellent and could not be surpassed.  I hope that same capability will be available when the change is made from St. Luke&rsquo;s to the other units.</P>
        <P>I could go on at length on the issue of the health service.  We have a ridiculous situation currently where a surgical ward is being wound down in Cavan hospital.  The senior staff there are extremely worried about the whole future of surgical services there.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>While the HSE media personnel continues to pump out guarantees, we know what those guarantees have meant in the past.  The Pathways rehabilitation centre in Cavan provided tremendous support for those who had strokes and other problems and helped restore many people to full health.  We were told it would only be closed until extra staff were appointed to it, but it was never reopened.  People now have a totally different and unsatisfactory service.  </P>
        <P>I plead with the Minister to ensure proper services for patients.  These must be provided not for our sake, but for that of patients, who should come first.</P>
     
        <P>Proper structures must be put in place in order to ensure that patients, regardless of whether they come from Malin Head, County Donegal, or wherever, will be able to avail of services and will not be obliged to wait months in order to obtain the treatment they urgently require.  If this happens, Fine Gael will have no difficulty supporting the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="637"/>
      <Speaker pid="ChrisAndrews"><NameTxt>Deputy Chris Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  If Deputy Crawford has inherited his mother&rsquo;s genes &mdash; she lived to 98 &mdash; then he has a long career in politics ahead of him.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for amendments to various Acts, namely, the Health Acts of 1947 and 1953, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.  As Deputy Crawford indicated, however, the main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the dissolution of the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, the transfer of the employees at the hospital to other facilities and the transfer of its assets and liabilities to the HSE.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital is located in Rathgar in my constituency of Dublin South-East.  For over 50 years it has provided state-of-the-art care for cancer patients from all over Ireland.  I do not believe I have ever heard anyone cast aspersions on or express concerns about the care provided at St. Luke&rsquo;s.  The fondness former patients have for the hospital and the high esteem in which they hold it is evidence of the high standards which obtain there.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the staff who, over many years, have provided an invaluable service to the people of Dublin and elsewhere.</P>

        <P>In 1981, the Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital was established to fund-raise and enhance the care and services available at the hospital.  To date, over &euro;26 million has been raised by people who have in some way been touched by what happens at the hospital.  There is not a family in Ireland which has not in some way been affected by the curse of cancer.  The raising of &euro;26 million is an incredible achievement and those responsible should be commended for it.  The Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital has done a huge amount of positive work.</P>
        <P>St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital is currently the largest provider of radiation, oncology and radiotherapy services in Ireland.  It has 179 beds and almost 500 staff.  As already stated, the Bill provides for the dissolution of the board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and the transfer of its assets and liabilities to the HSE.  The decision to proceed in this way was taken on foot of recommendations for the establishment of an integrated national oncology and wider cancer treatment service which were presented to the Department.  The former director of the national cancer control programme, NCCP, Professor Tom Keane advised and strongly recommended that this should happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am of the view that this is the best route to take in the context of cancer treatment.  In view of the nature of cancer, establishing centres of excellence is the way to go.  People will state that what is being done is not sufficient.  A journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step.  I am of the view that this is an important step on the journey towards ensuring that there will be a top-class cancer service in this country.</P>
        <P>The multidisciplinary approach to cancer treatment that is currently being pursued is central to the Government&rsquo;s strategy for the creation of a world-class cancer treatment service and is in line with best international practice.  The board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital is fully committed to supporting the Government&rsquo;s decision because it recognises that the approach being taken will ensure the optimal outcome for patients and will in time lead to better survival rates for those who contract cancer.</P>
        <P>Two new radiotherapy centres will open at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals at the end of 2010 under phase 1 of the national plan for radiation oncology.  As Deputy Crawford stated, it is important that we ensure that when the services at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital are being wound down, alternative services that will match the standards set at the latter in the past will be available.  The radiotherapy centre at St. Luke&rsquo;s will combine with these new centres to form the St. Luke&rsquo;s radiation oncology network.  All staff will be employees of the HSE.  Staff and <Col N="638"/>resources may be shared across the network and there will be a single team of physicists, engineers and other support staff for the three centres at St. Luke&rsquo;s, St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont.</P>
        <P>Some staff and resources from St. Luke&rsquo;s will be transferred to other sites in the network in the second half of this year.  The Department of Health and Children is working closely with the board of management of St. Luke&rsquo;s and the NCCP to ensure that the ethos of St. Luke&rsquo;s will be retained in the new structure.  One of the major assets of St. Luke&rsquo;s is the ethos to which I refer.  Others include the services provided, the compassion of staff and the magnificent and tranquil setting in which the hospital is located.  Radiotherapy services will continue to be delivered at St. Luke&rsquo;s until at least 2014, when additional capacity is scheduled to come on stream under phase 2 of the national plan for radiation oncology.  We must ensure that we obtain a commitment that following the completion of this integration, the Department of Health and Children will see to it that the future of St. Luke&rsquo;s will be aptly planned for.</P>
        <P>As already stated, St. Luke&rsquo;s provides a calm and tranquil setting in which people can undergo serious health treatment and recuperate.  The value of this cannot be overstated for those who are undergoing difficult treatment and living through an extremely stressful period.  There is a special quality about St. Luke&rsquo;s and I urge the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that the site will be retained in order that the type of care to which I refer can continue to be provided there for those who require it.</P>
        <P>As I have stated on many occasions and as the Minister will be aware, there is a chronic shortage of step-down facilities in the constituency of Dublin South-East.  St. Luke&rsquo;s is unique in the context of the provision of respite and palliative care and the site on which it is located should be earmarked for the provision of continuing care in the area.  A number of services are currently being provided in the area, including the out-of-hours GP service, which has been extremely effective.  We must develop it and ensure that we take advantage of the fact that we possess a prime location on the southside of Dublin.</P>
        <P>Last year, the Minister opened new step-down facilities at the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook and at Br&uacute; Chaoimh&iacute;n in Cork Street.  These developments are welcome but they constitute only a small piece of the jigsaw.  We must ensure that more beds to cater for people who are coming out of hospital are brought on stream.</P>
        <P>Deputies who live in Dublin will be aware that families in the city are often expected to send their elderly relatives to homes in counties Wicklow, Kildare or Meath.  This is a major inconvenience for families, particularly those with young children, who are obliged to travel long distances to visit such relatives.  People feel extremely guilty if they do not visit their elderly relatives and the need to travel long distances places a major strain on extended families.</P>
        <P>There is a significant burden of travel, for example, for an inner-city family whose elderly relative is being cared for somewhere in Kildare or Wicklow.  That is difficult financially and emotionally and it takes a lot out of families.</P>
        <P>It is vital that we take the opportunity to ensure St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital is developed in a way that is supportive of the need for community services by providing step-down facilities and long-term beds.  The hospital is an ideal site for the provision of such services and it should be preserved, even ring-fenced, to ensure people in the area have access to step-down facilities such as those available at the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook and the Br&uacute; Chaoimh&iacute;n in Cork Street.  That will ensure families have shorter distances to travel to see their parents and grandparents and will be able to give them the care and attention they need and deserve.  No family should have to make long traumatic journeys on various modes of public transport or be stuck <Col N="639"/>in traffic for hours in order to visit a loved one.  I am disappointed no decision has yet been made regarding the future of the St. Luke&rsquo;s site.  It is a magnificent facility on the south side of Dublin which offers an opportunity to cater for the older people in our community who, at a difficult period in their lives, require care.  Their plight should not be added to by having to be parted from their families due to weaknesses or gaps within the service.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State give an assurance that this site, with its long tradition of providing health care, will remain in the hands of the Health Service Executive and will become a step-down facility that will continue to serve the community of Dublin South-East in the manner it has done for many years?  I have visited many patients there and there is a tranquillity and serenity about the place that can only aid patients&rsquo; recovery.  The Friends of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital have done great work in the past in raising large amounts of money for the hospital.  A decision to sell off the land for some type of development would be the worst of all options.  Given the time and money invested in the site by the board, patients and relatives of patients, it would be a shame to let the opportunity slip past us to secure the future of this magnificent facility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Almost every family has been touched by the traumatic experience of cancer.  Concerns have been expressed in some quarters about the transferral of services to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, but St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital is not too far from St. James&rsquo;s.  The latter will not have the same appeal or offer the same tranquillity, but it will offer the services that are needed as it develops into a centre of excellence that will improve recovery rates for cancer sufferers.  It is imperative that we ensure we have the best facilities available to those with cancer.</P>
        <P>Deputy Crawford said earlier that St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital is to be closed; I do not see it as closure but as the transferral of services.  We have an opportunity to develop community services and to ensure older people can be cared for in their communities.  Any report that is available will show there is a shortage of step-down facilities for families in the south Dublin area.  I spoke to a woman today whose mother is in a facility beyond Bray and who is finding the travel particularly difficult.  She hopes to find somewhere closer to home for her mother where her mother&rsquo;s husband will also be able to visit.  That is another problem that often arises, where one older person may be unfit to remain at home but his or her partner can do so.  That puts a huge strain on the person who is at home and may have to rely on extended family to visit his or her spouse.  As I said, we should grasp the opportunity that is before us.  I urge the Minister of State to give a commitment to maintaining St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Rathgar as a facility providing essential community services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have listened carefully to all the contributions thus far and I regret that I am the first to state I oppose this Bill.  I do so for several rational reasons.  It implements the closure of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to facilitate the putting in place of a so-called national plan for radiation oncology which provides for four radiation oncology centres, two in the city of Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway, with what are termed satellite centres in Waterford and Limerick.  This is not a national plan by any yardstick.  It is not a national plan in the first instance because it is not an all-Ireland plan.  It is not a national plan because none of the proposed centres is north of a line from Dublin to Galway.</P>
        <P>I represent first-class Irish citizens from a constituency which, irrespective of what excuses or arguments are offered, is not being primarily provided for in this proposed arrangement.  Huge swathes of the country will not be served and cancer patients in those regions will have to travel unacceptably long distances to access radiation oncology treatment.  The health care rights and needs of the people of the Border counties and most of the western seaboard are being neglected yet again.  Let us be in no doubt about the magnitude of transport and access <Col N="640"/>issues for those seeking radiation oncology services.  Most Deputies who have already spoken in this debate have given personal testimony in regard to their and their families&rsquo; experience.  I can say in my experience that it is a harrowing prospect to have to travel long distances for radiation treatment.  It simply is not good enough that almost half the island in terms of this jurisdiction is to be left without a service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should not be surprised at this.  Fianna F&aacute;il health policy, as implemented by the so-called Independent Minister, wherever she might be, and the Health Service Executive, is denying the rights and failing to meet the needs of people every day in our health system.  Today again we see the outcome of the savage health cutbacks being imposed.  It has been announced that 60 beds at the Mater hospital are to be closed.  This follows the closure of 62 beds at Beaumont Hospital.  We learned yesterday that a whole range of services at Cavan and Monaghan General Hospitals in my constituency are to be closed for long periods during the summer.  For a full 29 working days, between 28 June and 20 August, stretching over a two month period, these services will be closed.  So much for the false promises of the Minister and Health Service Executive in regard to the range of care services that would be provided at Monaghan General Hospital following its being axed as an acute hospital almost 12 months ago in July 2009.  These services can now be opened and closed at will as if the HSE were running a corner sweet shop rather than a vital health care facility.</P>
        <P>The health care needs of the people I represent are a 365-day requirement, as is the case everywhere else in this country.  They are not a water tap that can be turned on and off to suit management or budgetary requirements.  People&rsquo;s health care needs are a daily need for address by the State.  The situation gets worse.  Figures supplied by the INMO show that as of 28 May there were more than 1,000 beds around the State closed.  The HSE is discharging long-term care patients and then closing beds despite the Minister and HSE having spent years telling us that the discharge of such patients would free up acute beds in our hospitals.  These beds are now being closed, which is an absolute outrage.  It baffles me that there is not greater anger being expressed in regard to all of these developments.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise here with the Minister as a matter of urgency an issue directly relevant to section 14 of the Bill, namely, the plight of residents in Loughloe House, Athlone and their families.  This particular matter has been raised in different ways here during the past number of weeks but there has not been any real or substantive address of the core issues involved.  As the Minister knows, the recent HIQA report on Loughloe House did not recommend closure.  It recommended important improvements, mainly in management, that can and should be made to keep this home open for current and future residents.  I must report to the Minister, as she may not know this, that the response of the HSE has been nothing short of scandalous.  Since the HSE announcement on Thursday, 6 May, of its disgraceful decision to close Loughloe House two of the residents have suffered strokes, one of whom is currently gravely ill in the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar.  Another two residents had heart attacks, one of whom died in Loughloe House four days after the HSE announcement.  One resident died having been moved from Loughloe House to St. Vincent&rsquo;s in Athlone.</P>
        <P>Residents have been warned not to talk to the press or public representatives.  The question that must be asked is why would residents be so warned?  Residents are threatened that they will be moved to Roscommon or Ballinasloe if they do not take the nursing home offered to them.  I am reliably told that one resident was threatened with the street if she did not take a bed in another nursing home.  On another occasion, staff were instructed to awaken a man from his sleep to tell him that he was leaving that day.  Another resident was threatened with <Col N="641"/>the door for &ldquo;inciting other residents to get them to stay put in Loughloe House&rdquo;.  The stress on residents, their families and staff is unbearable.  Only last week I met with a significant number of those families campaigning and staff at Loughloe House who attended the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Prior to the announcement, the last person in the home to die suddenly was a man who died from a heart attack a couple of years ago.  Look at what has happened since.  I implore the Minister to intervene now to protect the residents, to prevent the closure of Loughloe House and to prevent the eviction of residents from what is for them unquestionably their home.  If the Minister doubts anything I stated on the record of this House this afternoon, I urge her to order an independent investigation by the Health Information and Quality Authority and-or another agency she deems appropriate into the HSE&rsquo;s treatment of these vulnerable elderly people.</P>
        <P>On the Bill before us, Sinn F&eacute;in has supported the retention and further development of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  We hear much from the Government about centres of excellence.  St. Luke&rsquo;s has clearly been a centre of excellence for cancer care for many years, yet the Government wants to close it.  Like so many other Deputies I, too, had a personal experience of St. Luke&rsquo;s when my brother-in-law was a patient there last year, Go nd&eacute;ana Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam d&iacute;lis.  He was a young man.  I was impressed by St. Luke&rsquo;s.  This was undoubtedly a place apart, a hospital not like any other I had known.  The Government has, therefore, in my view failed to heed the testimony of current and former patients and staff at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in regard to the need to review and reverse the decision to close this facility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The experience of St. Luke&rsquo;s is replicated in hospitals around the country which this Government wishes to downgrade or close.  The Government is following a policy of over-centralisation of services and the privatisation of services.  This policy is driven by commercial interests rather than the interests of patients.  It is a policy that rewards the private health care sector with land on public hospital sites and tax breaks to develop private for profit hospitals.  At the same time, the Government wishes to close long-standing, tried and trusted facilities such as St. Luke&rsquo;s.  Cancer patients have been denied life-saving treatment because successive Governments have failed to provide the radiation oncology facilities required.  This dire need has been recognised for many years.  The Government had ample time and a booming economy to plan and budget for the provision of radiotherapy centres.  The State could and should have taken the lead and provided these centres directly as public facilities open to all on the basis of need alone.  Instead, the Government committed itself to public-private partnerships to deliver them.  When it was found that this would take too long a review was ordered.  This is what has led to the delay in delivery to 2014 or 2015.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, told us that the planned centres may have to be provided entirely by the private sector.  Professor Drumm has on the other hand told us that the public sector can do it.  Delay is piled upon delay and patients are dying.  This Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government is attempting to shirk its responsibilities for the chaotic state of cancer care services.  Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have for the past decade presided over a catalogue of failures and delays in cancer care.  What is needed urgently is comprehensive public cancer care provided in the public health care system and available to all based on need, regardless of ability to pay and without discrimination based on geographic location.  What is needed urgently is a comprehensive public cancer care provided in the public health care system and available to all based on need alone, regardless of ability to pay and without discrimination based on geographic location.  St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital should have a central role in such a renewed and reformed system.</P>
        <P>The Government has ensured that there will be no democratic accountability for these decisions.  It has insulated the HSE from any responsibility to the local communities it is sup<Col N="642"/>posed to serve and the Minister, Deputy Harney, has insulated herself from proper accountability to the D&aacute;il.  For all these reasons, and for many more I could add but time will not allow, I restate once more that I will oppose the passage of this Bill and I declare now that I will reject it.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Brian Hayes</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest>  the number of assistant principals and special duty teachers who have retired from primary teaching since the embargo on filling middle management posts was introduced in 2009; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23927/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Retirements at primary level since the introduction of the moratorium in March 2009 were 309 principals, 260 deputy principals, 145 assistant principals and 223 teachers with special duties posts of responsibility.  This is based on Department held data.  Vacancies at assistant principal and special duties level arise due to retirements in these specific grades and typically also from the knock-on effect of filling principal and deputy principal posts.</P>
        <P>When the moratorium was introduced the Government exempted principal and deputy principal appointments in all primary and post-primary schools and these continue to be replaced in the normal manner.  The impact of the moratorium is therefore limited to the assistant principal and special duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion.</P>
        <P>Unlike other areas of the public service retirement vacancies are actually being filled and what the school loses is the capacity to make a promotion by awarding the extra pay allowance to another teacher. The position whereby just over 50% of all teachers have promotion allowances is simply not sustainable.</P>
        <P>Further retirements and promotions later this year will impact further on middle management posts.  I am conscious that the impact of the moratorium on middle management posts has applied unevenly in schools and as I have already acknowledged the impact is not just due to the level of retirements but also as a consequence of promotions that are made to principal and deputy principal posts.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Finance in relation to some limited alleviation for schools that are actually affected by the impact of the moratorium.  Schools will be advised of the outcome of the discussions at the earliest possible stage so that they can plan ahead for the coming school year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said that schools will be advised of this decision by Government.  I raised this matter with her predecessor on 4 March and was told that a decision was imminent.  When the Minister spoke to the teacher union conferences nine weeks ago she said limited alleviation will occur.  Teachers in schools are either dealing with examinations or <Col N="643"/>are on their summer holidays.  Is the Minister seriously telling this House that she has no news for the schools on foot of this parliamentary question, when, effectively, such school authorities cannot make these appointments &mdash; even if it were possible for them to do so &mdash; on the basis that teachers have either broken for the summer or are on their summer holidays.  I ask the Minister to directly answer this question: when will schools be informed of the limited alleviation to which she referred nine weeks ago?  When will that happen?</P>
      </Speaker>
     <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I advise the Deputy that I have been engaged in discussions, as have senior officials on my behalf, at senior level with the Department of Finance in examining a methodology by which we can provide such limited alleviation.  My judgment is that we will be able to bring the matter to finality very soon.  I have returned to the Department on a number of issues regarding its consideration of sanction.  I want to obtain from the Department what is reasonable and fair.  I had thought that the matter would have been concluded last week when I got a response from the Department, but I have reverted to it on a number of issues that I want to have addressed.  Hopefully we will have the matter resolved in the next number of days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Department of Finance is running rings around the Minister and her Department, school authorities cannot make these appointments because they do not know the number of posts, if any, they will be allocated next year.  I are talking about the positions of year heads, programme co-ordinators and examination secretaries, key middle management posts within our education system, which cannot be filled now because the Minister has allowed the Department of Finance to run rings around her. </P>
        <P>Is it the case that her Department has given specific financial help to schools where a post holder has retired and the task undertaken by that person cannot now be done within the school?  In how many instances has that occurred?  I am aware of one where, as I understand it, the Department gave financial help either to the school or to employ a separate person to ensure that examinations could take place.  Can she advise the House how many specific instances have occurred where the Department has given such financial help to schools?</P>

	<P>If the Minister continues to pursue this policy, schools will not open in September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is probably not aware that protracted discussions can take place with the Department of Finance in the context of any of these issues.  We are engaged in dialogue and discussions on this matter.  Therefore, I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s perspective that the Department of Finance is running rings around my Department.  That is not the position.</P>

	<P>We are engaged in discussions, which I accept have been protracted, but my view is that these discussions will be completed soon.  What I want to obtain is a method by which we can address the concerns of a number of schools at primary and, particularly, at post-primary level.  I am doing my utmost to have that matter resolved so that the schools can deal with the issue of concern in this interim period.  However, it will be a limited alleviation and not a return to what was the position heretofore.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest>  if, in view of the fact that all five undergraduate primary teacher training colleges are owned and managed by the Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland and that such colleges are extensively funded by the Irish taxpayer and bearing in mind the provisions of Article 44 of the Constitution, she considers the compulsory requirement on students in these colleges to partake in religious studies, including faith formation for primary pupils as acceptable due the fact it denies the right of students to choose not to participate in such courses on the basis of their conscience; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23887/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct in his assumption that the B.Ed courses provided by all five colleges of education currently include modules on religious education.  This reflects the fact that primary schools are overwhelmingly denominational and have traditionally played and continue to play a significant role in the faith formation of their pupils, and the colleges have prepared their students accordingly.  As the Deputy will be aware, in relation to the Church of Ireland College of Education, a formal derogation under the provisions of the Employment Equality Act is sought from the House. </P>
        <P>My officials have been in contact with the colleges to seek elaboration as to how the process works in practice, and the experiences the colleges may have had in dealing with any situation arising in this regard.  The issue was also discussed at a recent biennial meeting between the colleges and my officials.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It may interest the Deputy to learn that all colleges have indicated that the issue of an exemption being sought by a student teacher in relation to the religious education module has not arisen in practice.  The colleges have indicated that any such request from a student teacher would be looked at pragmatically were it to arise.  In short, they have indicated that were such a situation to arise they would seek to ensure that it would not be an impediment to a student graduating as a teacher. In fact, one of the colleges has indicated that it is now in the process of proactively making provision to facilitate any student who expresses conscientious objections in the way the Deputy has described.  The colleges are keen, irrespective of the legal position, to ensure they cater for the needs of all students.</P>
        <P>On a related note, and as indicated previously in this House, my Department will seek the view of the Office of the Attorney General on the legal and constitutional aspects of this issue.  In the meantime, there will be further engagement with the colleges with a view to advancing the matter.  It is important to stress that the colleges are positively disposed to creating as inclusive an environment for students as possible and I support them in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills for her reply, but her response is somewhat inadequate as we approach the completion of the first decade in the 21st century.  This is a republic.  Articles 42 and 44 of the Constitution provide for education.  We have moved a long way from 1930.  People are entitled to the right of conscience.  The provision of education supported by the State is to be welcomed.  However, I note from a reply to a question I got from the Minister on 1 June that the State is providing in the <Col N="645"/>order of &euro;50 million a year to the five teacher training colleges.  Since the colleges have opened the door, will the Minister push it wide open and secure it, and request, by way of a formal letter, the colleges that are in receipt of &euro;50 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money to explicitly provide a freedom of conscience option?  The Minister should request the colleges which are in receipt of &euro;50 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money to provide an explicit freedom of conscience option for their teacher training pupils so that if they wish to exercise it they do not have to seek permission but can simply avail of what is provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to say this issue has not arisen.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry but the Minister cannot say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will call the Deputy again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not arisen in the context of discussions that happened between my Department and the colleges where the specific question was asked.  I support the colleges in having an inclusive environment.  As the Deputy knows, the Department has been involved in some curricular development work with Educate Together and with the provision of new modules, all ongoing.  As I indicated, we are going to seek advice from the Attorney General but while waiting for that advice we will work towards the formulation.</P>
        <P>Not only do I support this issue but so do the colleges which are very positive about the way in which this matter was raised with them.  I do not believe I should issue a diktat to them.  It is a matter of working together to see whether certain procedures need to be set up to allow this to happen.  As I indicated, one college is moving towards that at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not ask the Minister to issue a diktat, to quote her own phrase.  I asked her to act on the information volunteered to her and her Department, namely, that if a person requested the option it would be granted.  I simply ask for that negative to be turned into a positive.  In other words, a person does not have to ask but can avail of the option if he or she wants to because the provision is explicitly there.  It is not an off-the-menu item which can be obtained if one asks for it.  It should be an on-the-menu item for a student, who if he or she qualifies to be accepted into any of the five colleges, should be able to say, &ldquo;By the way, I don&rsquo;t want to participate in the faith formation component of the curriculum offered here&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister, in advance of the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice,  concerning which I believe he will be consistent as shown in the Protestant grant component being removed on his constitutional advice, act so that the same advice will prevail?  In order to prevent some difficulties of a much more substantial kind I respectfully suggest that the Minister invite the colleges to make explicit what they have told her is implicit in their handling of this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to say that this has not arisen as a key issue for student teachers.  We will be proactive.  As I indicated, one of the colleges is proactive in this and we will move towards that.  Neither side of the House is averse to this.  I have no problem in supporting this and the colleges do not have a problem.  It is a matter of working through how this can be set up simultaneously with the advice from the Attorney General.  This matter will progress in tandem with the seeking of that advice.  I do not want a situation whereby student teachers who have a conscientious objection would not be facilitated in any of the colleges.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister cannot say the situation has not arisen.  If one talks to the teachers&rsquo; unions they will say privately it has arisen.  The student teachers are scared to ask for it for fear of endangering their work opportunities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The State Examinations Commission has operational responsibility for the operation of the certificate examinations.  Each year the SEC employs additional staff to deal with the peak demands of the system.  These include temporary clerical officers, temporary porters, examination superintendents and examiners.  The SEC will employ up to 75 temporary clerical officers and 17 temporary porters this year.  All appointees to date and all those yet to be appointed have been and will be drawn from the register of unemployed persons maintained by the Department of Social Protection.  Examination superintendents are drawn from a pool of experienced teachers.  The SEC will appoint superintendents to 4,692 centres this year.  It is a long standing policy that unemployed and substitute teachers are recruited first, before drawing on the wider pool of applicants.  A total of 213 unemployed teachers and 574 substitute teachers have been appointed to date, and the process is ongoing.  Appointments are made by the SEC on a county basis.  Surplus applicants in one county are drawn on in a neighbouring county where vacancies occur.  In addition, schools appoint some 7,500 superintendents directly to work in centres catering for students with special needs.  The profile of these appointees is not held by the SEC.  Examiners are recruited to mark candidates&rsquo; scripts, oral and practical tests, and are recruited on the basis of their academic qualifications, examination and teaching experience.  They are mainly drawn from the pool of practising teachers.  Some 6,000 examiners will be employed in 2010.  To date 190 unemployed teachers have been engaged by SEC for this purpose.</P><Col N="647"/>
        <P>In the recruitment of temporary staff, the State Examinations Commission is committed to giving priority to unemployed persons to the maximum extent commensurate with ensuring appropriate expertise and quality in the operation of the examination system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>How can the T&aacute;naiste say that when the information she gave to the House is to the contrary?  Basically, she informed the House that of the 12,000 appointments as superintendents for the State examinations starting next week, 800 are unemployed or substitute teachers, or approximately 7%.  This is at a time where there are almost 440,000 people unemployed in this country.  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept the information she has received from the State Examinations Commission?  Will she inform the House how many retired teachers are employed by the SEC either as superintendents or for the purpose of correcting those papers?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>

        <P Just="Left">I indicated in my reply that the SEC is very cognisant of the need and commitment to support people who are unemployed.  That is why the support staff will be, in the main, those from the unemployed register.  It will continue to make further appointments for substitute or unemployed teachers.  I do not have the numbers to hand of those who are retired.  We want to ensure that there are people with the relevant capacity to supervise the examinations, who have the experience to assure the candidates of the highest quality.  I do not have the numbers or know even whether they are available but I can revert to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I would be grateful if the T&aacute;naiste would find out the number of retired teachers who are obtaining a pension from the State and working in the State examinations from next week.  I would like that information.  We all need it.  We all have a responsibility.  When we allow 12,000 people be employed by the State for two, three or four weeks in June we have a duty and a moral obligation to ensure those jobs are ring-fenced for unemployed people.</P>

Is this not a form of restrictive practice on the part of the SEC, supported by the Department of Education and Skills?  There are many unemployed people who would love the opportunity to work for the month of June.  They would love the opportunity to work for June but the Department, through the State Examination Commission, SEC, is not providing that opportunity to them.</P>

	<P>The school transport scheme, which is operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, facilitates the transportation of over 125,000 children to primary and post-primary schools each day.  School transport is a very significant operation involving about 42 million journeys and over 82 million kilometres on 6,000 routes every school year.  The arrangements currently in place for school transport annual charges, namely &euro;300 per eligible and concessionary post-primary pupil, &euro;200 per concessionary primary pupil and a maximum family charge of &euro;650, will remain in place for the 2010 to 2011 school year.</P>
        <P>The total contribution of charges from parents in 2009 still only represents 7% of the overall expenditure of &euro;177.4 million by the State on school transport.  In order to minimise the overall effects on families, school transport charges have been confined up to now to eligible post-primary children and children availing of concessionary transport.  Charges continue to be waived in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical card and in addition, eligible primary children and children with special needs still travel free.  A maximum family charge of &euro;650 also applies.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the McCarthy report made recommendations to levy charges, at both primary and post-primary level, at a rate of &euro;500 per annum per child or 50% of the full economic cost of providing the service, with the exemption for social welfare recipients continuing to apply.  The recommendations in the McCarthy report fall to be considered as part of the annual Estimates and budget process.  It would not be appropriate to comment specifically on whether any of these recommendations or other expenditure issues will be included in next year&rsquo;s Estimates and budget prior to Government consideration and decisions on the Estimates for 2011.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  However, it does not set out or allay the fears of thousands of hard-pressed parents.  We are discussing the 2010 to 2011 school year but we really want to know about the following academic year.  Will the Minister of State reject any proposals by the Department of Finance to increase the fee from &euro;300 to &euro;500?</P><Col N="650"/>
        <P>Only 125,000 people are availing of school transport, a number which has decreased by 10,000 because the fee has increased by 203% from &euro;99 to &euro;300 already.  People are using their own transport or that of other parents and friends.  The viability of school transport in rural areas as we know it will be undermined.  Will the Minister of State allay the fears of the parents that the fee will be increased?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware that there was no increase in charges from 1998 until the third term of the 2007 to 2008 academic year.  There were three increases following from that.  I am not responsible for recent newspaper articles on the issue and the McCarthy report is freely available.  It goes without saying that all aspects of that report will be considered by all Departments in the context of the Estimates for 2011.  I reiterate that there will be no changes to charges for the 2010 to 2011 school year and the Estimates process for 2011 is at a very early stage.  All items of expenditure in the Department of Education and Skills will be considered in that context.  I am not in a position to say what will be in the budget and Estimates for 2011.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is a reasonable man.  Will he fight the corner of the hard-pressed parents and rural students who will not be able to afford this extra increase if he does not resist it?  Will he reject the proposals of the McCarthy report to increase the charges from &euro;300 to &euro;500?</P>

It is a national scheme and I am totally committed to its aims and objectives.  The Estimates process will be announced and commence in the course of the budgetary proceedings.

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest>  the number of students in primary and post-primary education who miss more than 20 school days per year; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23930/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, is the statutory body with responsibility for school attendance.  The board compiles statistics based on attendance returns at the end of each school year.  The findings from these reports help to identify trends in school attendance.  The most recent statistics on national levels of school attendance are contained in the report, Analysis of School Attendance Data in Primary and Post-Primary Schools, 2006/7 and 2007/8, published by the NEWB earlier this week.</P><Col N="651"/>
        <P>The report shows figures for 20-day absence have remained fairly stable over the five year period from 2003/04 to 2007/08 with, on average, 58,000 or 12% of primary and 57,000 or 17% of post-primary students absent for 20 days or more during each school year.  The report also shows that non-attendance is more prevalent among older children and children who come from more disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P>Educational welfare officers of the NEWB work with approximately 8,000 children each year who are reported as having serious school attendance or school placement difficulties or who have been expelled from schools.  The NEWB has, in the past, issued information leaflets to parents and run public awareness campaigns to raise the profile of school attendance.  It also operates an education helpline to provide information on attendance and related matters.  Since September 2009 the role of the NEWB has been expanded to include the school completion programme and the home school community liaison, HSCL, programme as well as the visiting teachers service for Travellers.</P>
        <P>School attendance is a central objective of the newly expanded service.  The school completion programme includes attendance tracking as one of its main preventative strategies.  HSCL co-ordinators work with parents to promote school attendance.  These services are available to all schools participating in DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, the action plan for educational inclusion.  The visiting teachers for Travellers work directly with the Traveller parents and children to promote regular school attendance and participation in school.  In line with Government policy the board prioritises its resources to support schools participating in DEIS.</P>
        <P>This integrated approach is part of the Government&rsquo;s overall approach to transforming public services announced in November 2008 and will significantly benefit service delivery to children and their families and assist schools in meeting the challenges they face in tackling poor attendance and early school leaving.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State view it as acceptable that the National Education Welfare Board, NEWB, publishes these data on a three-year basis and that the information in the most recent report to which he referred is two years out of date?  Why can the information not be published by the NEWB on a year-by-year basis instead of once every three years, given the fact that principals give the NEWB the information as requested three or four times per year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware of a certain amount of unhappiness on the part of teachers regarding the bureaucracy associated with this matter.  Under the Act, schools are required to report on school attendance for the year.  This can only occur at the end of the year.  Each year, the board receives the schools&rsquo; reports and conducts a process to correct some of the information provided.  For example, some schools include PLC students or make errors in respect of their enrolments.  Other schools need to be reminded to submit their returns.  The information is then analysed by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, in Drumcondra and further verification is undertaken.  The process can take up to one year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Schools are also required to report absences exceeding 20 days or where there is a concern about the absence profile of a child.</P><Col N="652"/>
        <P>The published figures relate to the 2007-08 period.  I do not agree that they are significantly out of date, having regard to the information I have supplied to the House.  Nevertheless, I could take the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on board and endeavour to have the figures published, but we must bear in mind the considerations I mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to change because a year-by-year account is necessary.  If the Minister of State is speaking sincerely about transforming the public service, we must have the information on a real-time basis in light of the fact that schools have given it to the NEWB.</P>
        <P>While there is a legal obligation on schools to report children who miss more than 20 days, the real acute cases of absenteeism are those of more than 40 days, as the Minister of State is aware.  Will he assure the House that local educational welfare officers are making adequate interventions?  Will he inform the House of the number of educational welfare officers and will he indicate if those posts are subject to the ban on recruitment witnessed elsewhere in the public sector?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be said that, under the Education (Welfare) Act, responsibility in this regard rests primarily with parents and schools.  We would all accept this, yet there is still a need for intervention by the NEWB.  If a child has been absent for more than 60 days, the educational welfare officers become engaged in his or her situation, but only after all other efforts have failed.  As I mentioned in my reply to a previous question, other supports are in place to assist schools, parents and teachers, such as the home-school community liaison programme, the schools completion programme and so forth.</P>
        <P>The NEWB has a budget of &euro;9.6 million and 109 posts, 106 of which I understand are probably filled.  The moratorium applies, but we are in discussions with the Department of Finance in respect of the role of the NEWB&rsquo;s chief executive officer, a post that will fall to be filled in the near future.</P>

        <Quest>  if she has read the report produced by Engineers Ireland called the Task Force on Education of Maths and Science at Second Level; if she will consider implementing all of its proposals; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23713/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the report of the task force and the positive support it gives to the developments under Project Maths.  I am committed to boosting attainment levels in maths and encouraging more students to study the physical sciences in senior cycle and to choose careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.</P>
        <P>A Project Maths implementation support group, which includes a representative of Engineers Ireland, will report to me shortly on how best an industry-education partnership can add value to Project Maths, promote positive attitudes to mathematics and encourage more students to study mathematics at higher level.  The Engineers Ireland report recommends that Project Maths should be adequately resourced in terms of materials and continuing professional development for teachers.  Some &euro;5 million is being invested in professional development for teachers this year, building on a &euro;3 million investment in 2009.  Project Maths will continue to <Col N="653"/>be a priority for investment in an ongoing programme to at least 2013.  The report also places strong emphasis on ensuring that mathematics teachers are adequately qualified, but quotes an incorrect assumption that only 20% of teachers have mathematics as a major qualification in their degrees.  The data available from the Teaching Council, when applied to the estimated 5,900 teachers teaching mathematics, would suggest that 65% hold a major qualification in mathematics.  Upskilling teachers through postgraduate programmes will form a major element of Project Maths and funds for intensive programmes have been provided in 2010 to begin this process.</P>
        <P>The task force report also states incorrectly that a major proportion of science teachers are not qualified to teach the subject.  This is not the case and the 2002 report of the task force on physical sciences, from which the data were quoted, made it clear that there was no evidence that leaving certificate physics or chemistry were being taught by teachers lacking a significant qualification in the subject.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, there are many useful recommendations in the report that my Department will be pleased to take forward in discussion with stakeholders.  In particular, a range of concrete actions are suggested in respect of Engineers Ireland in supporting the work of schools and colleges, building on the excellent work already under way under the STEPS programme as part of the Discover Science and Engineering initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for her reply.  I am interested to hear there is a dispute over some of the factual accuracy of the statistics.  I trust the T&aacute;naiste has moved to clarify and get agreement.  In fairness to Engineers Ireland, it asserts that between 20% and 25% of the teachers in question have a degree in mathematics, but it is uncertain as to how many of the remaining teachers&rsquo; degrees, while including mathematics as a major subject, were actually in mathematics.  The same question pertains to science.</P>
        <P>Surely the T&aacute;naiste will take on board the fact that our outcomes, as measured by the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, would suggest we are on or just below average where mathematics and science literacy as opposed to reading literacy are concerned.  Project Maths is a good place from which to start, although there are some reservations.</P>
        <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate how many of the task force&rsquo;s 18 proposals will be implemented by her Department?  Does she recognise the need for some type of on-line upgrading of mathematical and science teaching skills for existing teachers?  Will she have regard to the model of Hibernia College, which has been successful in upgrading on-line those teachers who want to improve their skills at their own cost?  What steps will she take to resource Project Maths with the qualified teachers it requires?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  These figures originated from the Royal Irish Academy and were repeated by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.  However, the Teaching Council indicates the figure as being 65% based on the fact that, when one has an acceptable qualification to teach maths, one must have at least 30% of overall content within the syllabus.</P>
        <P>We would take on hand a number of the other recommendations made by Engineers Ireland, for example, the use of ICT in the delivery of programmes, which is being integrated in the development for the teachers in question.  It is a positive way to access teaching and there are also new types and formats, such as blended learning, etc.</P><Col N="654"/>
        <P>As to incentivising teachers and students through awards, Engineers Ireland is interested in working with us.  Other recommendations include consistent quality tests at the end of primary education and the use of transition year to encourage young people.  These are enterprising recommendations and can be accepted and worked towards.  Another question concerned how to improve continuity and linkages between primary, post-primary and third levels.  These are issues which I will certainly be taking on board as part of ongoing development work.  The engineers are involved themselves with work we are doing on more career guidance and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste seems very open to the suggestion.  Is she aware that the Teaching Council is blocking or resisting efforts by Engineers Ireland and others to get into the area of the upgrading skills for the teaching community?  That is now the case, and Hibernia College is not recognised by the Teaching Council even though it is one of the major providers of national school teachers.  I offer this by way of information rather than as a question, because there is a closed educational community with regard to information.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the 18 recommendations in the report is that science should become a compulsory subject for the junior cycle, because of our poor track record in PISA studies and our aspirations to become a knowledge economy.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on this?  At the moment, 21 EU states currently have science as a compulsory subject at junior cycle, but we do not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the outcomes of the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio was that many minority subjects were cancelled from school timetables.  Is the T&aacute;naiste gravely embarrassed by the fact that over 55 schools dropped a science subject last September, at a time when she and her Cabinet colleagues were telling us all about these documents on an innovation task force, the smart economy and so on?  The hard fact is that we are losing science subjects in our schools.  That has been brought about as a result of the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
        <P>I have one final question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a statement, actually.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The STEPS programme is produced by Engineers Ireland.  It is a wonderful programme where they bring their own engineers into primary schools all over the country.  A very small amount of money comes in from the Department of Education and Skills, but it provides a major additional benefit to those primary schools.  Is there a guarantee that this money is in place next year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation also supports Engineers Ireland.  I met its representatives on a number of occasions when I was in that Department and I asked them to do a number of things.  They were a very forthcoming and progressive group of people.  We continue to have challenges to our public spending.  That is an issue and it is why we are looking at sharing a number of specialist teachers in particular areas, so that we can provide that curriculum choice.</P>
        <P>There is no intention to make science compulsory, but I have checked the numbers and it may as well be compulsory, because a significant percentage of young people take science for their junior certificate examination.  Much of that has been built up due to an appreciation at <Col N="655"/>secondary schools that many students wish to take specialist science subjects at leaving certificate level.  The real issue is related to the specialist subjects over and above biology.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not have thought chemistry and physics were specialist subjects over and above biology.  We are talking about science.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>

	<P>I smiled at the Deputy&rsquo;s remark that Hibernia College was not on the Teaching Council.  I have been in discussions with Hibernia College in respect of the delivery of a number of programmes on re-skilling people with certain qualifications who wish to convert them into teaching qualifications.  Not everybody who gets a teaching qualification will automatically get a job, but I believe the college has done a great amount of work and has been able to deliver a number of highly trained teachers, and my own people in the Department have told me this.  There is no ethos or anything else attached to it, just in case the Deputy is worried that such a choice is not there.  I would also like to advise the Deputy that I appointed somebody today from Hibernia College to the Teaching Council.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government approved the general scheme of the qualifications and quality assurance (education and training) Bill, which provides for the establishment of an amalgamated qualifications and quality assurance agency, provisionally titled &ldquo;Qualifications and Quality Assurance Ireland&rdquo;, on 13 January 2010.  Drafting of the legislation has been progressing since then.  The amalgamation presents a considerable legislative challenge as it involves consolidating and amending functions currently performed by at least five separate agencies.  It is intended that the legislation will be published in the autumn and that the new body will be established in 2011. Administrative preparations for the amalgamation of the bodies concerned have been advancing in parallel with the preparation of the legislation.  In January, my predecessor established an interim board of the new agency, comprising the chairs of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Irish Universities Quality Board, whose functions are to be taken on by the new body.  The interim board is currently arranging for the appointment of a chief executive officer designate, who will also act as chief executive officer of the NQAI until the amalgamation.  The interim board and the CEO designate, in co-operation with the existing agencies and my Department, will co-ordinate the admin<Col N="656"/>istrative arrangements for the establishment of the amalgamated qualifications and quality assurance agency.  It is expected that savings will arise as a result of the amalgamation, although it is likely that once off up front costs arising from the process will be incurred.  However, it should be noted that the NQAI, HETAC and FETAC have already delivered very significant savings since the announcement of the amalgamation in October 2008, with the bodies&rsquo; Exchequer allocation for current expenditure in 2010 being approximately 25% lower than the outturn in 2008.  Further savings may be achieved through the removal of parallel structures and streamlined and shared corporate services, including accommodation.</P>

        <Quest>  the intervention made by F&Aacute;S to enable unemployed apprentices to finish their apprenticeship and thereby either travel with their recognised qualifications or attempt to set up businesses here; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23570/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A wide range of measures has been initiated through F&Aacute;S to support over 4,600 redundant apprentices to make progress with their apprenticeships in 2010.  These measures are in addition to measures which in 2009 supported over 3,200 redundant apprentices.  Over the two years, F&Aacute;S will have supported the progression of over 7,800 redundant apprentices.  The main measures are as follows.  First, F&Aacute;S has put in place an interim measure whereby 3,200 redundant apprentices may progress to the next off-the-job training phase of their apprenticeship this year, of which over 2,500 have already begun.  This is in addition to the over 2,400 redundant apprentices who were assisted to progress in 2009.  Second, we are introducing a new redundant apprentice placement scheme through F&Aacute;S which will utilise &euro;4 million to subsidise the on-the-job training at phases three and five of up to 750 apprentices.  This scheme is to replace and expand the redundant apprentice rotation scheme introduced last year, which supported 460 apprentices.  I will be formally launching the details of this scheme in the coming weeks. Third, a joint ESB Networks and F&Aacute;S programme will provide up to 400 places over a period of 18 months and of these, 335 have completed or are currently in training.   Fourth, F&Aacute;S is inviting 300 redundant apprentices to undertake assessments at the final phase of their apprenticeship in the trades of carpentry and joinery, electrical, plumbing, brick and stone laying and plastering.  In addition, redundant apprentices registered for four years who have successfully completed all phases of their apprenticeship, but who have not yet <Col N="657"/>completed the required four years in employment as an apprentice in the specified trade, will be contacted by F&Aacute;S to submit a portfolio of evidence under recognition of prior learning for consideration by the national apprenticeship advisory sub-committee for the award of the advanced craft certificate.  Finally, over 175 redundant apprentices have enrolled so far in 2009 and 2010 in existing trade-related specific skills training courses and evening courses that are available at F&Aacute;S training centres to enhance their employment skills.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her response.  What incentives, if any, does F&Aacute;S offer to employers to take on apprentices, particularly those who have only to do a small amount of work experience to be fully qualified?  Does the Minister have any information on apprentices who may be put on short time?  I have come across a number of apprentices in that position; they are technically employed but cannot finish their training because they have been put on short time by their employer.  What does the Minister have to say about granting permission to submit portfolios to apprentices who have completed phases one to seven but not the required four years work?  This is essential if apprentices are to work here or abroad in their profession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the final question, we are in the process of contacting those people to see if we can, on the basis of the experience they have thus far, allow the certificate to be given to them.  There is an appreciation that four years work experience cannot be achieved.</P>
        <P>On the issue of incentives, as Deputy Stanton knows, there are agreed industry rates for specific apprenticeships and we make a contribution of &euro;250 per week towards employment costs incurred on a 39-hour working week.  When we established the rotation scheme a number of issues were raised which did not fine-tune what we wanted to achieve.  The placement scheme will allow us to incentivise the employer to take on a redundant apprentice, even though they may keep one of their own, so that person can achieve his or her qualifications.  We had to evaluate the criteria.  We were not particularly happy what we wanted to achieve was being achieved so we have reviewed the criteria.  I hope to have the information available very soon.  We have a few people in the scheme because I wanted to get it started but we are reviewing the criteria to facilitate other people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on the situation in which some apprentices on short time find themselves?  It is a limbo situation.  Will she look into it?  Does she have any information on the number of apprentices who might be in that position and can she do anything to help them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to see what is the situation with those apprentices.  We are trying to work with the reality, which is that a number of people are finding it quite difficult to complete apprenticeships.  We also have people who have completed apprenticeships and who wish to convert, and we have introduced a number of conversion courses for those who want to have an additional qualification in, for example, the new energy initiatives.  I do not have the number of those who are not redundant but who are working but not getting enough experience.  I will certainly speak to the apprenticeship people and see whether there is a way in which we can address these concerns.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government decided in July 2009 to put in place a new framework for the promotion, regulation and co-ordination of international education services.</P>
        <P>In line with the Government&rsquo;s decision I am committed to promoting Ireland as a centre for international education in a way which is sustainable, which has the needs of learners at its heart, and which develops mutually beneficial relationships with countries which are strategically important to Ireland&rsquo;s long-term national interests.  A number of steps have already been taken and other measures are in course of implementation.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has been given responsibility for promoting and developing the national education brand, and for developing international higher education in Ireland.  It is working closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland who have retained responsibility for development of the English language sector.</P>
        <P>The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland has taken on responsibility for regulation of international education, including the internationalisation register, which governs access by non-EEA students to the labour market and the voluntary recognition scheme for the English language sector.</P>
        <P>The forthcoming qualifications (education and training) Bill, which will be published in the autumn, will give the amalgamated qualifications and quality assurance body responsibility for introducing a new statutory quality mark and code of practice covering both the academic quality and the pastoral care of international students.</P>
        <P>The Government has also established a high level group on international education, which brings the relevant Departments and State agencies together with representatives from the educational sector to facilitate more effective co-ordination of national approaches to international education.</P>
        <P>The high level group has been tasked with producing a action plan for enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s performance as a centre for international education.</P>
        <P>The action plan will set out a vision, which will be shared by Government and the education sector, for Ireland&rsquo;s internationalisation objectives over the coming five years.  It will propose targets in a range of areas against which progress can be measured.  It will also make a number of recommendations in areas where progress is required.  These will include enhanced inter-institutional collaboration, the development of a strong national brand, consistent and supportive State actions and policies and the creation of internationally oriented and globally competitive institutions.</P>
        <P>I have set the high level group a deadline of late summer for submission of this action plan, and I understand the group is on target to reach this deadline.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Minister accept that we are effectively ten years behind other English speaking countries which have managed to carve out a very significant niche in the area of international students coming to their respective countries?  In 1999, her previous Department launched a document called Asia Strategy, as she will be aware, and it set out the ambitious target that by 2009 17,000 students should come from the Asia market, which is particularly lucrative.  The figure for 2009 was 3,594.  It is completely shambolic for her to say in the House that new targets will be established when we have not even managed to achieve the targets we set ourselves in 1999.  Has the Minister met the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this specific issue?  The net problem is the fortress attitude of one Department in respect of providing visas to young people to come to this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the statistics, it is important to state how many people are here; a total of 26,000 international students studied in Irish higher education institutions, HEIs, in <Col N="659"/>the academic year from 2009 to 2010.  This is broadly similar to previous years.  Approximately 94,000 international students studied in English language schools recognised by the Department of Education and Skills.  It is a decrease from the 120,000 students in 2008 but there are issues, including the global downturn and currency fluctuations, which have caused the decline.  That being said, as Deputy Hayes knows, the Asia strategy is being reviewed and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation will introduce a new strategy on trade which will set down further targets.  There have been issues in setting a quality mark, which is something I continue to believe is hugely important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Other issues include the lack of pastoral care and I will introduce a code of practice on that.  On cannot expect people coming here to make decisions, particularly if they are not from our culture, and not have a pastoral care aspect.</P>
        <P>In setting down the targets I do not disagree that we are behind the curve when it comes to the internationalisation of our education.  We have had internationalisation with regard to medical students, something we have benefited from greatly in trade policy.  That being said, we can continue to see this as a very viable option.  There is great eagerness by those in those institutions to provide third level education and the teaching of English.  We must have those assurances and I am hopeful we can continue to grow and develop this sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a shared view on this matter, and we have discussed this previously at meetings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science, so I will cut to the chase.  What is the level of responsibility within Enterprise Ireland for the promotion of education?  What official has responsibility?  Is it a senior official?  Is it someone&rsquo;s full-time day job or is it a part-time add on?  If the T&aacute;naiste does not have the information to hand, she might communicate it to me.  If it is an add on then it is not a job at all.</P>
        <P>In her reply, the T&aacute;naiste referred to the high level group co-ordinating all of this.  Who is the representative from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on that group?  Again, if the T&aacute;naiste does not have the information, she might communicate it to me.  If it is not a principal officer, or preferably an assistant secretary, it is a waste of time.</P>
        <P>With regard to the action that the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department can take, what action has it taken to close down bogus universities masquerading as Irish universities?  I know the legal advice is that one cannot move until one has 120% proof, but these are fly-by-night operations.  There is such a thing, in a legal senses, as firing a shot across the bows.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the issue of bogus colleges, it is important to say &mdash; I did not have the information to hand when I spoke to the Deputy previously &mdash; that a number of colleges have been  removed from the register.  One has been reinstated on the basis that the issues of concern have now been addressed.  We have also had the threat of removal from the register by the Department with a number of the colleges.  I was of the view that perhaps we could close them like we closed head shops, although I was told I was a bit more exuberant than I should have been, based on the legal advice.  The appropriate thing to say is that when we are encouraging people to come here to study English at third level that they are acutely aware, as part of our brand and marketing strategy, that colleges must be on the register and have a quality mark.  We will be very cognisant of the fact that people are well-informed before they make decisions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very conscious of the difficulties created for grant awarding authorities and for individual students following the unprecedented surge in student grant applications in 2009.  Therefore, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have prioritised a range of initiatives to facilitate speedier processing of grant applications in 2010.  This includes the introduction of a new, greatly simplified, application form and explanatory notes, which were made available on the <i>www.studentfinance.ie</i> website in recent weeks, considerably ahead <Col N="661"/>of last year&rsquo;s time frame.  In addition, I published the grant schemes for 2010 last week, some months ahead of the publication date last year.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently working closely with the VECs and local authorities to advance development of a scaleable on-line application facility for which tenders have already been sought.  My Department is also examining the possibility of a further roll-out of payments to students by way of electronic funds transfer which proved very successful in the pilot phase in 2009-10.  The issue of cash flow for grant awarding authorities has also been addressed through the introduction of an advance payment arrangement.  Taken together, I am hopeful that all of these measures should serve to assist awarding authorities in the earlier and more efficient processing of student grants this year.</P>
        <P>In the longer term, a more fundamental restructuring of the whole grants administration function will be facilitated by the passage of the Student Support Bill.  I am currently re-assessing the organisational options provided for in the Bill with a view to streamlining operations and maximising administrative efficiencies in line with the Government&rsquo;s wider programme of public service reform.</P>

	<P>What is holding up the Student Support Bill?  When does the Minister expect to progress the Bill through Committee Stage and bring it before the House in order that it can be passed?  Are many students still waiting for grants this year?  </P>

	<P Just="Left">We do not know.  Can the Minister tell us when she expects students to begin receiving confirmation of whether they have been successful in their applications for grants?  Will it be in September or October?  In other years this went on until November, December, January, February and March and people were waiting.  Does the Minister realise that very often it is the poorest of the poor, the most vulnerable and those who are most under pressure who are left until last?  Is she aware of or has any research been carried out into the number of students many of whom have had to drop out of colleges because they did not receive a grant in time in the past year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A few grants have not been paid but many of those cases are due to the fact that inadequate information was provided.  There is only so much that the people working at the coalface can do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that will be of benefit in making sure that people have all of the requisite information that is required.  I am not aware of anyone who has stepped out of college because of the difficulties.  I am very cognisant that we need to get this matter streamlined.  Students can apply through the CAO and make a very good job of it, yet they cannot apply for the student grant scheme because they seem to be afraid of it.  I want to make sure that we can transfer that ability into the summers.  I have also asked that career guidance teachers be made aware of the new scheme to allow, facilitate and encourage students to apply, in a similar fashion to the points system when they sit down with a big red letter and say, &ldquo;You must do this, you must do that&rdquo;.  They could do the same thing with the student grant scheme.  I hope to try to get the scheme, payments and acknowledgements of eligibility as quickly as possible because I am aware of these types of issues and the angst it provides, not just for students but mainly for their parents.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe tabled this question.  The point he wanted to raise is the question of independent residency for mature students.  There is a difficulty, in particular for those mature students who are in rented accommodation and simply cannot get the documentation to satisfy the requirements of the grant system.  Will the Minister examine the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>They will not accept independent applications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is an answer to it in a later question.  We have exceptions.  We had this problem a couple of years ago, as the Deputy is probably aware where we had students from the European Union, mar dhea, coming in and taking up places.  All sorts of issues arose.  It has stopped because we have been able to deal with those issues.  There are two issues.  One has to make sure, given the scarce resources we have, that people who have entitlements get paid and do not lose out.  Where there are flexibilities with regard to the scheme the Department, through the VECs and county councils, try to address that issue.  If there are specific issues my Department or I will be more than happy to facilitate them.</P>

      </Qst><Col N="663"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, is a statutory agency established under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999.  I am not empowered to issue instructions to HETAC on the performance of their functions and I have not contacted them about the college referred to by the Deputy.  That college is an approved PLC centre which is managed and funded by City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, CDVEC, from grants provided by my Department.  Under the terms and conditions of the PLC scheme, courses provided by approved PLC centres must be at FETAC level 5 or 6 on the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, or equivalent. </P>
        <P>My Department has facilitated the provision by Ballyfermot College of an animation course which is accredited by Dundee University as the equivalent of a Level 8 award on the NFQ honours bachelor degree or higher diploma for a number of years and continues to do so as an exceptional measure.  It is open to the college to seek to have HETAC accreditation for this animation course.  However, the provision of any further courses above FETAC  level 6 by Ballyfermot College would have to have regard to existing policies on further and higher education provision, resource constraints and the present approved number of PLC places nationally and, in particular, for CDVEC.  In that regard, my Department has supported the development of linkages between the further and higher education sectors by improving access and progression opportunities for learners.  An example of this is the higher education links scheme.  Moreover, greater co-operation between the sectors in delivering educational opportunities is currently under consideration by the Higher Education Authority, which will advise my Department in due course.</P>
        <P>A high level group is currently developing a new national strategy for higher education and is examining, amongst other issues, how the system should be configured to best meet the many challenges it faces over the coming decade, having regard to the key role it has to play in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  As part of this work the group is examining the structure of the higher education system, including the number and roles of institutions within it.  The strategy group is expected to finalise its report before the summer.   There are no plans to develop new higher education institutions at this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am tempted to recommend the establishment of an air traffic control unit in Marlborough Street to co-ordinate all these high flying groups.  This is a very high flying and achieving college.  It has 1,620 pupils and I am sure the Minister of State is aware that some of them recently won Oscar awards for animation.</P>
        <P>I am aware the Minister of State cannot instruct people but he has the power of persuasion.  The college is asking that it be permitted and encouraged to deliver programmes to higher certificate level 6 and honours degree level 8 in suitable vocational areas.  The programmes would be validated by an Irish awarding body and subject to the normal strict criteria for validation and accreditation that prevail for all higher level programmes.</P>
        <P>I ask that innovation and success in education be rewarded.  I am reliably informed that all the pupils who graduate from this college find employment.  They work in a creative area that we need to encourage.  The college simply asks that Dundee&rsquo;s validation be swapped for some form of accreditation within the Irish Republic.  Surely Fianna F&aacute;il is not so anti-national that it cannot find a way to achieve that objective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very aware of this issue, having received correspondence on it and I met with people who are directly involved with Ballyfermot College of Further Education.  I congratulate it on its recent Oscar success.  Ultimately, however, Ballyfermot is a college of further education that provides PLC courses at FETAC levels 5 and 6.  We would need to have regard for existing policies in further and higher education provision, resource <Col N="664"/>constraints and the present approved number of PLC places nationally and in particular for City of Dublin VEC.</P>
        <P>I advise the college to engage in discussions with Dublin Institute of Technology with a view to possible partnership arrangements.  The Deputy&rsquo;s proposal may appear straightforward but it would have significant implications for other colleges of further education and higher education policy generally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>If it had implications for other colleges, would that not be welcome?  We would have more clarity on who awards what in this country.  One of the best news stories for Irish education came from this college during a time of depression.  This solution has been suggested by the college as well as by graduates who would like us to alternate the awarding body.  </P>
        <P>I wonder at what level in the college were the people who the Minister of State met.  I have also received representations.  We have an opportunity to get this right and if it has implications for other colleges of further education, so what?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Deputies opposite are too long in Government when the permanent civil servants are telling them what they can do.  I cannot but imagine what the Minister of State&rsquo;s late father would say if we pulled off an Oscar validated by a degree from Dundee and some permanent bureaucrat in Marlborough Street said the policy cannot be changed because of regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no legislative impediment to a further education college applying to become a HETAC registered provider.  However, having regard to policy on further and higher education provision and general resource constraints, I am anxious to ensure that PLC colleges confine their offerings to FETAC levels 5 and 6 courses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Except when they win Oscars.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Courses at HETAC level 7 and above are to be provided by recognised third level colleges.  I would encourage the college to explore possible partnership arrangements, particularly with DIT.</P>

	<P>Over two months ago, the day care services for elderly people in the Boyle area were curtailed.  These services, for which they each paid &euro;4, transformed their lives by allowing them to meet friends, eat dinner, play bingo, get their hair done and receive physiotherapy, as well as giving their families some respite.  With one clinical nurse manager on sick leave, the embargo on HSE recruitment has denied day care services to these elderly people who gave so much to our country.</P>
        <P>This problem has continued for too long.  I have raised it under Standing Order 32 almost every second day in the D&aacute;il.  Three weeks ago, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, assured us that a clinical nurse manager was due to be appointed.</P>
        <P>On 15 May, we were told that the services would resume and that it was merely a matter of receiving a letter from the Department of Finance.  However, these services continue to be denied and I have repeatedly been in contact with the HSE and the Department of Health and Children, both of which appear to be involved in a turf war.  The HSE wants a letter from the Department of Finance before it can permit the appointment of a clinical nurse manager.</P>
        <P>I am sick and tired of this nonsense.  These elderly people and their families are very angry at the way they have been treated.  I seek a satisfactory answer because the buck has to stop with the Department of Health and Children.  Has the Department sanctioned the appointment of a clinical nurse manager so that the people who built his country can be afforded the day care services they deserve?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to clarify the position regarding the operation of the general public sector moratorium in the health services.</P>
        <P>The Government has made clear that a critical part of its strategy to restore the public finances is the achievement of sustainability in the cost of delivering public services relative to State revenues.  To help achieve this goal, it will be necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and to reduce public service numbers over the coming years.  This requires that the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the health service will continue to apply until numbers have fallen to the level set out in the employment control framework for the health sector.  The framework for 2010-12 gives effect to the Government decision on employment policy in the public sector and provides for a net reduction in employment of 6,000 from March 2009 to the end 2012, with consequential pay roll savings.</P><Col N="666"/>
        <P>Based on reductions already achieved in 2009, the net target reduction to the end of 2012 is 4,560 whole time equivalents.   Therefore, the net target reduction in numbers in 2010 and the following two years is 1,520 wholetime equivalents.</P>
        <P>The Government decision has been modulated to ensure key services are maintained in so far as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, this nonsense has to stop.  The issue I raised related to the Plunkett home in Boyle.  I want an answer to my questions on the issue.  I am listening to nonsense from the Minister of State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would appreciate if the Minister of State would provide me with the information this evening.  I have tried to contact the Department on numerous occasions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I sympathise with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy.  The position is not satisfactory from my point of view either.</P>
        <P>The framework provides for a number of grades and posts that are exempt from the moratorium on recruitment and promotion.  In addition, the HSE also has the capacity under the framework to fill some exceptions from the general moratorium provided it achieves the overall target reductions.  To minimise the impact on essential service delivery, the reorganisation and restructuring of work is required.  The redeployment and reassignment of staff, optimal skill mix and scheduling of services will be an essential part of this process.</P>
        <P>The draft public sector agreement reached between public sector unions and management will play an important role in this regard.  The draft agreement provides for greater flexibility, an extended working day and redeployment of health sector staff.  Ultimately, this will have a positive impact on the provision of health services and allow the transformation agenda to continue.</P>
        <P>I will convey the Deputy&rsquo;s views to the Minister for Health and Children and endeavour to obtain the additional information he requires.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter, specifically the reduction of &euro;1.08 million in the budget of the Brothers of Charity in Bawnmore in Limerick.  This 4% cut has resulted in the decision by the Brothers of Charity at the Bawnmore centre to close in ten days&rsquo; time the only respite facility it has for intellectually disabled adults in Limerick city.  The closure will affect 63 families, many of whom are elderly or widowed carers of sons or daughters.  They have reached crisis point as they face the loss of the only respite care facility available for loved ones.  The closure, which has been caused by a shortage of funding to the Brothers of Charity in Limerick, is unacceptable and an absolute disgrace.</P>
        <P>I anticipated that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, or the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Moloney, would come to the House to address this issue.  The Brothers of Charity in Bawnmore do fantastic work but face a shortage of funding.  A cut of &euro;1.08 million or 4% in a budget is severe.  It has forced the Brothers of Charity to reorganise services in Bawnmore with the result that one respite house will be closed affecting 63 individuals and their families, another three residential units in the city have been closed and a further residential unit in Bawnmore must be reorganised.  They have also had to curtail canteen facilities for more than 200 people who use them daily.</P>
        <P>If the Minister of State provides a general response, it will be unacceptable.  Deputies are being forced to submit general questions on the Adjournment when the Government is well aware that we seek responses on specific issues.  I want to know whether funding of the order of &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000 will be restored to ensure respite services are not discontinued on 14 June.  Will the Minister of State also confirm that the funding of &euro;1.08 million will be restored?</P>
        <P>The Government attacks the most vulnerable, a category which includes the disabled.  The parents and siblings of disabled people are so tired from caring for their disabled sons and daughters and brothers and sisters that they do not have the energy to respond to Government cuts such as these.  Service providers such as the Brothers of Charity in Bawnmore are doing fantastic work but are being curtailed by a lack of funding.  The moratorium on recruitment is not being applied in a consistent manner, specifically in respect of the Brothers of Charity in Limerick.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to confirm that funding will be restored to enable the respite facility in Limerick used by 63 families and their loved ones to remain open.  While the sum involved, &euro;150,000, falls far short of a Taoiseach&rsquo;s salary, it impacts on 63 families.  I also want the Minister of State to state the &euro;1.08 million in funding cuts will be restored.  Society is judged on how it deals with the most vulnerable, including the disabled.  I do not want a general response but specific assurances that this matter will be addressed.</P>

	<P>The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. Where this is not possible, the Health Service Executive supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  In line with this overall approach, a priority of Government in recent years has been to develop a range of community based supports such as home help, home care packages and day-respite care.  Between 2006 and 2010, additional investment of more than &euro;200 million was provided to the HSE to develop community-based services for older people.  Without these initiatives, many older people would spend longer than necessary in acute hospitals, or would be admitted to residential care earlier than might be required.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The HSE service plan 2010, approved by the Minister for Health and Children last March, commits the executive to providing agreed levels of service nationally for these key community support areas.  The plan includes respite care, often available through day care or home care packages, and is delivered either directly by the HSE, or in partnership with the voluntary or private sectors.  Broadly speaking, the level of community supports for older people in 2010 is in line with 2009 provision.  There is an increase this year in the number of home care packages available due to an additional &euro;10 million given in the last budget for this purpose.</P>

        <P>The key activity targets contained in this year&rsquo;s HSE service plan are almost 12 million home help hours to approximately 54,500 people, increased home care package provision from 8,700 recipients at any one time in 2009 to 9,600 in 2010 and a total of 21,300 day care places, which is estimated to cater for up to 80,000 people.  While this target is slightly down from a comparable figure of 21,600 places last year, the respite element of day care would be generally compensated for in the overall 2010 home care service picture.</P>
        <P>Any changes to these commitments, as part of the agreed HSE service plan, would need to be notified to the Department.  Other important initiatives are also being undertaken at a <Col N="669"/>strategic level to improve community-based services for older people.  Arising from an evaluation of home care packages, published by the Department last December, the HSE established a taskforce to progress, this year, various improvements in home care provision.  The Department accepts the need for a more standardised approach to home care generally, whether by public or private provision.  This year the HSE intends to finalise and circulate standardised access and operational guidelines for delivery of home care packages, adopt and disseminate a voluntary code of quality guidelines for home care support services for older people and develop and publish a procurement framework for home care services.</P>
        <P>The various guidelines now being prepared are intended to allow the HSE implement a more standardised approach nationally to the provision of home care services, including respite care, in the context of interlinking with the wider range of services.</P>
        <P>The HSE has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services.  The Deputy will appreciate that all developments in the area of home care need to be addressed in light of the current economic and budgetary pressures.  The executive has been asked to make a rigorous examination of how existing funding might be reconfigured or reallocated to ensure maximum service provision is achieved.  This requires a stringent ongoing review of the application of the resources available.  It is, consequently, a matter for the executive to manage the services I have outlined, including respite care, at national, regional or local level, bearing in mind all relevant factors such as overall resources, local circumstances or evolving service priorities.</P>
        <P>I have taken note of what the Deputy said about Limerick city and will convey his views to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue once again.  There is a crisis in Mountjoy Prison.  In recent weeks the governor of Mountjoy men&rsquo;s prison has announced his retirement while the governor of the women&rsquo;s prison has resigned.  Both cited appalling conditions at the prison and the fact that they were being constantly undermined in their attempts to run effective prisons.  In April Mr. John Lonergan announced his decision to retire as governor after 42 years in the Prison Service.  He said his concerns about the prison had been totally ignored over the years and his autonomy as governor had been constantly reduced to the point where governors have almost no discretion regarding how prisons operate.</P>
        <P>A week later Ms Kathleen McMahon pointed to significant overcrowding problems and the ridiculous and disgraceful practice of incarcerating women for failing to keep up with loan repayments.  She noted that D&oacute;chas prison was designed to hold 85 inmates but at the time of her statement had 130 women in the prison.  In Mountjoy, a prison designed for 489 prisoners, the average number of prisoners behind bars this year is 630.  Those concerns have been echoed by an outgoing member of the Mountjoy Prison visiting committee, Mr. Paul McKay, and others.</P>
        <P>The periodic flare up of violence in Mountjoy is a reminder of the constant low level violence and threat of violence with which inmates and staff contend on a daily basis.  Non-gangland prisoners are being mercilessly targeted by gang members.  This is evident in published photos, circulated via mobile phones, of an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; prisoner stripped naked, beaten and tied up within the four walls of the prison.  Images have also been circulated of gang members brandishing improvised weapons including &ldquo;shanks&rdquo; &mdash; knives made from box cutter blades.  There <Col N="670"/>is allegedly a constant stream of prisoners being taken to the accident and emergency unit in the Mater Hospital for treatment for injuries arising from beatings, stabbings and slashings.</P>
        <P>The Prison Officers Association claims that staff members are barely able to cope with the levels of violence and intimidation, and are suffering from stress.  A moratorium on recruitment and a reduction in overtime is making life for the prison staff in Mountjoy almost impossible.  The Council of Europe Anti-Torture Committee has described conditions in Mountjoy as &ldquo;inhumane and degrading&rdquo;.  That label should be a source of shame and disgust to a government but this Government and the Minister for Justice and Law Reform are clearly without any moral compass.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A drug culture dominates and the prison chaplains have repeatedly warned that those who enter prison clean are likely to leave with a drug problem.  Last month, it was reported that the Inspector of Prisons discovered 26% of the prison population, 825 prisoners, were being locked down because they or prison staff believed their lives were in danger.  They are, effectively, in prisons within the prison system.  This record number of inmates locked away for 23 hours a day, 365 days a year, has come about as a result of the entry into the prison system of the increasingly brutal feuding between large drug gangs on the outside.</P>
        <P>Obviously, prison is where criminal gangsters belong, but is it the place where fine defaulters belong?  Is it the place where petty criminals belong?  Would minor offences not be better dealt with via the sanction of community service, thereby freeing up vital prison spaces?  Kathleen McMahon claimed in her resignation statement that women were being locked up for inability to pay debts.  In a reply to a parliamentary question on 13 May, I was informed that the number of committals to prison for failing to pay fines is 1,431 up to and including 31 March 2010.  How can the Minister stand over this system?</P>
        <P>The expensive fairytale of Thornton Hall solving all the problems clearly lies far into the future.  I want the Minister to give me a date because the date I am hearing is not sooner than 2016.  I believe it is in the constituency of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and he has an interest.  What is to happen in the meantime?  Will we see ongoing violence, drug addiction, intimidation, overcrowding and inhumane and degrading treatment?  Is this situation tenable because it may someday in the distant future be improved?  It is not tenable.  There are steps that can be taken immediately to improve matters, foremost among them being a change in practice to ensure that petty criminals are given community sanctions rather than being incarcerated in overcrowded jails.  I have raised this matter before, raise it today and will continue to raise it until matters are improved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  At the outset I reject the accusation that the Minister is without moral compass.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately prison overcrowding is not unique to this country.  It is happening in many countries.  The Minister is on record as saying before that there is no instant or quick fix solution.  Rather the approach must be to focus on taking measures in the short to medium term as well as in the longer term.  This is what he is doing.</P>
        <P>The increase in committals to prison can be attributed to a range of positive developments in the provision of resources to the entire criminal justice system.  For example, extra garda&iacute; result in more successful prosecutions by the courts.  There are 1,000 more criminals in our prisons now than there were there in 2006.  It is accepted that the approach to tackling overcrowding must contain a range of strategies.  Irish prison management has been supported by <Col N="671"/>the Minister and the Government in managing the serious and consistent upward trend in the prisoner population.</P>
        <P>Statistics for the number of new prison spaces provided since 1997 speak for themselves.  In that period almost 1,800 spaces have been provided.  This is a fact and is solid proof of putting resources into providing the highest standard of accommodation in prisons.  The current capital building programme in the prisons will mean that almost 40% of the entire prison estate will have been replaced or refurbished.</P>
        <P>The Minister makes no apology for this investment.  He believes we needed to put in that investment when the economy allowed us to do so.  In the changed economic environment we now find ourselves in, there will be continued investment in the prison system, Thornton being a firm commitment.  A further 200 spaces are being provided in the short term.  This will be by means of a new block that is ready to open in Wheatfield prison.  The Deputy will also be aware that work is expected to start in the latter half of this year on a new 300-space block in the Midlands Prison complex in his own constituency, providing much welcomed job opportunities in the construction phase.</P>
        <P>In the longer term, a new purpose-built campus style prison development at Thornton Hall will provide approximately 1,400 cells on a 130 acre site.  This will allow for the replacement of the antiquated Mountjoy Prison campus with modern fit for purpose and regime orientated accommodation.  The new facility will have operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 prisoners in a range of security settings.  The Thornton Hall project is progressing on a phased basis and will provide the kind of prisoner regime and staff accommodation that will stand the test of time.</P>
        <P>On the non-custodial front, the Deputy will be aware of the provisions of the new Fines Act, which will further assist in keeping people out of prison.  Other initiatives, such as community service orders and restorative justice, also have a place in the menu of disposal options available to the Judiciary.  In the context of overcrowded conditions in prisons, the point is sometimes made that we are sending people to prison who should not be there.  The reality is that the prison system must accept all prisoners committed into its care by the courts.  The Deputy and his party must also accept that we have some very serious criminals in our prison system serving longer sentences for serious and heinous crimes and while non-custodial options do have their place, we need to maintain a balanced approach to public safety.</P>
        <P>The mission of the Irish Prison Service is to provide safe, secure and humane custody for those placed in custody and in that regard no level of inter prisoner violence is acceptable, either to prison management or the Minister.  On a daily basis every effort is made by prison staff and management to limit the scope of acts of violence.  No doubt the Deputy will accept that while the prison regime is designed to limit the scope for acts of violence, it is not possible to completely eliminate the possibility of such acts in prisons holding a high proportion of violent offenders without introducing a regime that would be so restrictive as to be unacceptable.  Prison management, for example, monitors the situation of prisoner interaction and where prisoners are identified as exerting undue influence or pressure over other prisoners, such offenders receive close and continued attention and targeted searching from the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s operational support unit.  The general experience is that attacks by prisoners on other prisoners are not usually random attacks of violence.  Rather, they are related to matters on the &ldquo;outside&rdquo;, such as drug debts or gang rivalries.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is fully aware of the range of increased security measures introduced into the prison system in more recent times.  On the Minister&rsquo;s behalf I do not propose to list them <Col N="672"/>here.  Suffice to say that the Irish Prison Service management have advised the Minister that they are satisfied that they are making a difference.  The Minister and the director general of the Irish Prison Service are acutely aware of the necessity to do all in their power to maintain a safe and secure prison environment for staff and prisoners.  The Minister will continue to work with the director general and his senior management team to meet this ongoing challenge.</P>

      <sTitle>Demonstration Library Programme</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The demonstration library project is one of the most important and innovative initiatives of the Department of Education and Skills and is designed to encourage and develop literacy skills of students in schools in designated disadvantaged areas.  The announcement earlier this week that the project is at risk is of huge concern.  The decision to abolish the project will, if it happens, affect 22 schools.  It will have a negative impact not just on the schools affected, but on the students most in need of the project who will lose out on vital opportunities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am familiar with a number of schools in my constituency where this library support is available.  It was and continues to be a real bonus to the students who might be at risk of leaving school without any formal qualifications.  I have seen for myself the difference it has made, not just in terms of the literacy skills that it has helped to promote, but also by way of the social development it has engendered.  It has created an environment where books of all sizes and shapes and difficulty are no longer seen as a threat to students and something that should be avoided at all costs.  Instead, the availability of books in an attractive environment with ease of access has stimulated an interest in reading in students that would never have expressed any interest in literature.  This is the report from their teachers and from the librarians.  It is also my own experience, having seen these libraries in three schools in my constituency and observed the interest of the students in spending time in the library.  The project has also generated an air of confidence in the students in tackling literacy issues that previously held no interest for them.  The library project has also formed a new type of social interaction between the students themselves, their teachers and the librarians who have been so supportive of the students&rsquo; needs.</P>
        <P>In a press release in July 2008, the former Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe,  stated: &ldquo;The project puts in place high quality, fully stocked and equipped modern libraries and provides each with a professional librarian.&rdquo;  He went on to say: &ldquo;These are not ordinary school libraries, they are creative active learning centres&rdquo; and &ldquo;are designed to entice and engage the most reluctant teenager&rdquo;.  It would be truly regressive if this facility was now withdrawn.  Last week, in reply to a parliamentary question raised by my colleague Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, Deputy Haughey stated that the demonstration library projects formed an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s strategy on tackling illiteracy.  However, on the same day, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, confirmed in a separate reply that the library staff were subject to the public sector moratorium on recruitment.  We need clarification on this issue so that the schools can plan for the coming academic year confident that this vital support will be retained.</P>
        <P>I am asking this evening that this project be retained, by whatever mechanism is required.  If the project is lost, it will send out a singular message that literacy does not matter and that it is a right only for those who can access it with academic ease and with the financial wherewithal to do so.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="673"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity, on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan, to outline the up-to-date position regarding the demonstration library project that forms part of the junior certificate school programme, JCSP, literacy strategy.</P>
        <P>The JCSP has operated in schools nationally since 1996, as an intervention at junior cycle for students who, for a variety of reasons, have experienced difficulties in school and hence are considered to be at risk of leaving school early.  The programme is founded on the premise that all young people can be successful at school.  It provides a curriculum framework which assists schools and individual teachers in adopting a student-centred approach to education.  Students are given enhanced opportunities to engage with the curriculum and to achieve success at school through a system of profiling of achievement.  The programme covers a broad range of personal and social skills, as well as academic achievements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since poor levels of literacy and numeracy have been widely acknowledged as factors which hinder student progress, under the programme the implementation of literacy and numeracy strategies is fundamental.  The JCSP support service works with schools to employ classroom strategies to develop students&rsquo; literacy and numeracy skills and to encourage them to adopt a whole-school approach to literacy and numeracy.  This is facilitated by providing teachers with ongoing professional development on cross-curricular approaches to literacy and numeracy, as well as by the provision of resources annually to support the implementation of specific initiatives in both areas.  At present, the JCSP is offered in 240 schools, 184 of which are DEIS schools, and provides support for 9,000 students.  Over &euro;3.07 million was spent on this programme in the past three years and &euro;1 million has been allocated for 2010.</P>
        <P>The demonstration library pilot project, which forms part of the JCSP literacy initiative, provides professionally staffed libraries for JCSP schools.  The project was announced as a pilot in 2001, with libraries being set up in 11 JCSP schools in 2002.  The Department, through the JCSP support service, provides the support necessary for schools to: establish and equip high quality school libraries; develop structured library based strategies with ICT support for JCSP students with literacy difficulties; employ professionally qualified school librarians who work with the teaching staff to develop and implement the JCSP literacy strategy and who are supported by the project librarian and the JCSP support service; and participate in an ongoing monitoring and evaluation process, which is a major part of the project.</P>
        <P>To date, 30 schools have been included in the project.  Some 25 of these are DEIS schools.  The librarians in many of these schools are currently employed on fixed-term contracts and one further school has a vacancy.  The remaining schools are either staffed by librarians who have been redeployed from the library service or those with contracts not falling for renewal.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector so as to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the public sector in order to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer.  The terms of this moratorium require that no public service post, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion nor payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade.  As the T&aacute;naiste has previously set out, this decision also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed-term basis and to the renewal of such contracts.  Exemptions from the moratorium are, in the context of the public finances, a matter for serious deliberation.  The T&aacute;naiste is, however, working together with her colleague, the Minister for Finance, in respect of those aspects of the moratorium which are having a particular <Col N="674"/>impact in the education sector.  The employment of librarians in the demonstration library pilot project is one such issue.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Deputy for providing me with the opportunity to outline the up-to-date position in respect of this matter.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the comments of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,  in relation to Chinese in the Leaving Certificate. I am also aware of the  importance of Chinese language learning in promoting  trade and development  between Ireland and China as part of the Asia Strategy. </P>
        <P>Post graduate and honours degree level programmes in Chinese are offered in  University College Cork, and honours degree level programmes are provided in  University College Dublin, Dublin City University and the Dublin Institute of  Technology.</P>
        <P>The Institutes for Chinese Studies in University College Dublin and in  University College Cork both offer programmes in Chinese in partnership with  the Confucius Institute.  These colleges also offer tuition on an outreach  basis to schools in their locality. The feedback from this initiative is very  positive. My Department will continue to work closely with the colleges and the  Confucius Institutes to support and progress this initiative, to the extent  that the funding from the Confucius Institutes will allow.</P>
        <P>Overall there are a range of foreign languages available on the curriculum in  schools -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Arabic. A  post Primary Languages Initiative is in place since 2000 with the objective of  diversifying language provision in schools, focusing particularly on Spanish,  Italian, Japanese and Russian.</P>
        <P>Experience to date has been that while students appreciate the opportunity to  learn new languages, and are making good progress, the overall take-up remains  low, and it is extremely difficult to develop a capacity and cadre of teachers  within the existing system who are capable of teaching the new languages. For  example, Japanese continues to be provided through the provision of &ldquo;bought in&rdquo;  additional services provided by Japanese language assistants. Although third  level programmes offering degrees in Japanese are being provided, it has not <Col N="676"/> resulted in qualified teachers of Japanese gaining employment in schools, or in  schools prioritising Japanese as a subject within their approved quota of  teaching resources.</P>
        <P>The Government is prioritising an agenda of curriculum reform in science and  maths and improving innovation capacity in second level schools. The  funds  currently available in this difficult budgetary context do not allow for  the  inclusion of additional languages in the curriculum at present. However, I will  keep the matter under review.</P>

	<P>I consider that the debate that we participated in  this House two weeks ago  was, as I said in my closing remarks, informed, informative, balanced and  sincere. The real message I have garnered from the debate is that primary school patrons  provide education in the best interests of children. As the Minister for  Education and Skills, my role is to ensure this situation continues and I look  forward to determining how to advance the matter.  In my opening statement two weeks ago I highlighted three developments underway.</P>
        <P>The first relates to the development of a new type of primary school and I  envisage that this development will be discussed in detail in this House with  the publication of a Bill for consideration that will include provisions for  the statutory underpinning of new Community National Schools.</P>
        <P>The second relates to new arrangements for the recognition of new primary  schools.  I am awaiting advice from the Commission on School Accommodation  which I expect to receive in the next month or so.</P>
        <P>The third relates to the potential for the Catholic Church to divest patronage  in some schools.  My Department is examining a number of initial locations to  see what scope or options might exist for a change of patronage in these  cases.  The aim is to complete the assessment within the next month with a view  to publication of the list.</P>
        <P>I recognise there is a need to continue to seek the input and views of a wide  cross section of contemporary Ireland on the relevant issues.  I prefer to  advance consideration and trialling of the practical issues at this stage so  that specific proposals can be developed and issues identified rather than a  more general and theoretical discussion at this point.</P>
        <P>I am committed to further consultation with the education partners and the  wider public. Two weeks ago in this House, I listened to the Deputies&rsquo; opinions  on the nature of consultation and I wish to continue to reflect on these views  as the work underway is advanced and various stages of it completed.</P>

        <Quest> if she will review the process of proving independent residency for independent mature students applications, in view of the fact that many applying for funding have been living in rented accommodation for a number of years, but through no fault of their own can not provide the <Col N="677"/>required documentation to prove same; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their  circumstances either as students dependent on parents or a legal guardian, or  as independent mature students. An independent mature student is defined as a  mature student who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents or legal  guardian from the October preceding entry to an approved course.</P>
        <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students,  the schemes specify that parental income or legal guardian&rsquo;s income must be  taken into account. Independent mature students, on the other hand, are  assessed without reference to their parents&rsquo; income or that of a legal  guardian. The reckonable income of an independent mature student is that of the  candidate only and of his or her spouse where appropriate.</P>
        <P>In order to establish a candidate&rsquo;s status as an independent mature student,  documentary evidence is required as proof of a candidate&rsquo;s address from 1st  October of the year preceding entry into college. In considering whether a  mature student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her  parents, awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt  that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period  has been submitted by the grant applicant.</P>
        <P>The documentary evidence normally required by a local authority or VEC to  establish independent residence includes utility bills, such as telephone, gas  or electricity bill, evidence of registration with the Private Residential  Tenancies Board or official documentation received at the address, for example,  from a Government Department.</P>
        <P>In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to produce such proofs  of residence in the relevant period for demonstrable reasons, the awarding  authority may, at its discretion, agree to accept other documentary evidence  that provides an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the  relevant period. For example, while an affidavit, if accompanied by other  supporting documentation, may be considered as evidence of independent living,  an affidavit in isolation is not considered acceptable as sole proof of  residency.</P>
        <P>My Department has reviewed the requirements for establishing independent  residency and is satisfied that the current practice in this regard is both  reasonable and appropriate.</P>

	<P>As outlined in the Government Legislative Programme, the Education (Patronage)  Bill 2010 is to be published during the current session.</P>
        <P>The Community National School primary school model involves individual VEC&rsquo;s  acting as Patron in line with the practice that applies in the primary system  generally and the draft legislation which I propose to introduce to the D&aacute;il  very shortly will give statutory effect to these arrangements. The legislative  proposals will also underpin the independent status of a primary school Board  of Management established by a VEC.</P>
        <P>Pending enactment of the Bill, I as Minister for Education and Skills, am  acting for the interim period as patron of the five Community National Schools  established to date &mdash; Scoil <Col N="678"/>Choilm, Scoil Ghr&aacute;&iacute;nne and Scoil Chormaic in County  Dublin, Naas Community National School in County Kildare and &Aacute;rd R&iacute; Community  National School in County Meath.</P>
        <P>The development of the Community National School model of primary school is a  response to the level of societal diversity and demographic change which is  underway in this country.  It represents an additional patronage option which  will sit alongside the established patrons in the primary system as an option  for parents who, increasingly, seek greater choice in school type for their  children. As noted in this House during the recent statements on the  Diversification of Primary School Provision,  the discussion on the draft  legislation will be an opportunity to explore the many issue that arise in  relation to this new patronage model. I look forward to that debate.</P>

	<P>Froebel College of Education in Blackrock, Co. Dublin was established by the  Dominican Sisters in 1943.  Currently Froebel College of Education is funded by  my Department for its initial primary teacher education programmes.  The  management and trustees of Froebel College of Education have entered into  discussions with the National University of Maynooth with a view to the work of the College becoming part of the University&rsquo;s operations and an  announcement to this effect was recently made. </P>
        <P>The College is a private institution and is free to enter into such talks and  my Department has no objection in principle to the planned move.  My Department  has advised both institutions that such a move must meet the requirements of  the Universities Act 1997, and that the Higher Education Authority should be  consulted with regard to the requirements. It is understood that discussions in  this regard are ongoing.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that a &ldquo;Froebel Department of Early Childhood and Primary  Education&rdquo; be established at the University and that all of the student  teachers from Froebel College will move to the University campus.  I understand  that NUIM proposes to build a new facility on campus to facilitate the  incorporation of the College. The details of the capital build and the  financing and staffing arrangements have yet to be finalised.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 29 together.</P>
        <P>The number of apprentices made redundant in 2008 was 2,481, the number in 2009  was 3,791 and to date in 2010 the number is 892.  In total there are 7,164  redundant apprentices of whom almost 4,500 are eligible for F&Aacute;S initiatives  when taking into account those who have not successfully completed training  assessment exams to date.  A wide range of measures has been initiated through  F&Aacute;S to support over 4,600 redundant apprentices to progress their  apprenticeships in 2010. These are in addition to measures which in 2009  supported over 3,200 redundant apprentices.</P>
        <P>The following measures have been initiated by F&Aacute;S to support redundant  apprentices:</P>
<P el="5">1. F&Aacute;S has put in place an interim measure whereby redundant apprentices may  progress to the next off-the-job training phase of their apprenticeship, in  line with current scheduling criteria.  In 2009, over 2,400 redundant  apprentices were provided with off-the-job training. To date in 2010, 2,523  redundant apprentices commenced off-the-job training and of these 1,251 have  completed phase 4 and phase 6 off-the-job training in the Institutes of  Technology and Colleges of Further Education.</P>
<P el="5">2. F&Aacute;S in 2009 introduced a temporary Employer Based Redundant  Apprentice Rotation Scheme for apprentices made redundant in the Construction  Industry whereby the vacancy arising from the release of the employed  apprentice to a scheduled phase 4 and phase 6 off-the-job training phase was  filled by a redundant apprentice who thereby gained on-the-job training. Over  460 redundant apprentices completed Phase 3, 5 and 7 on-the-job training and  assessments with employers under this Scheme in 2009.The Redundant Apprentices  Placement Scheme is to replace the Rotation Scheme for 2010. The scheme with an  allocation for 2010 of almost &euro;4m will provide up to 750 apprentices with the  opportunity to complete their on-the-job training at Phases 3 and 5 with the  support of employers with a proven past record of providing consistent  systematic training.</P>
<P el="5">3. A joint ESB Networks / F&Aacute;S programme commenced in March 2009 where  on-the-job training with ESB Networks is provided to eligible redundant  apprentices at Phases 5 and 7 of their apprenticeship.  This programme will  provide up to 400 places over a period of 18 months and is funded by ESB  Networks. To date 236 (104 Phase 5 and 132 Phase 7) redundant apprentices have  completed training, 99 (53 Phase 5 and 46 Phase 7) are currently in training  and a further 65 Phase 7 redundant apprentices will commence in July 2010.</P>
<P el="5">4. F&Aacute;S and the Institutes of Technology have agreed the PP5 programme for  redundant apprentices who have successfully completed Phases 1-4 of their  apprenticeship and where an on or off-the-job training opportunity is not  currently available.  The programme has both a Construction Stream and an  Engineering Stream, with a number of core skills modules related to  apprenticeship and a number of electives in specific skills.  The programme  provides apprentices with a Level 5 FETAC award and allows for access and  transfer of credits to other post-apprenticeship programmes.  The Institutes of  Technology are currently providing training to eligible redundant apprentices  who responded to invitations issued in January 2010.</P>
<P el="5">5. F&Aacute;S has also developed Phase 7-equivalent assessments for redundant  apprentices at the final phase of their apprenticeship in the trades of  Carpentry &amp; Joinery, Electrical, Plumbing, Brick &amp; Stonelaying and Plastering.   To date, 39 redundant apprentices have com<Col N="681"/>pleted assessments, 30 are currently  undertaking assessment, and F&Aacute;S is inviting a further 351 to undertake Phase 7  assessments.</P>
<P el="5">6. Redundant apprentices registered for 4 years who have successfully completed  all Phases 1-7 of their apprenticeship, but have not yet completed the required  4 years in employment as an apprentice in the specified trade, will be  contacted by F&Aacute;S to submit a portfolio of evidence under Recognition of Prior  Learning for consideration by the National Apprenticeship Advisory  Sub-Committee for the award of the Advanced Craft Certificate.</P>
<P el="5">7. Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing trade-related specific  skills training courses to enhance their employable skills.  They may also  avail of the range of trade-related evening courses available in F&Aacute;S Training  Centres.</P>
<P el="5">8. Under the EU Leonardo da Vinci III Lifelong Learning Programme, Leargas in  collaboration with F&Aacute;S, has supported 45 apprentices to date to complete their  final on-the-job work placement in companies abroad. 36 redundant apprentices  are scheduled for on-the-job work placements by the end of 2010 and a further  15 during the first half of 2011.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s more specific queries  I am informed by F&Aacute;S that:&mdash;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the number of apprentices registered for 4 years with Phases 1-7 completed  is 266;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />216 apprentices have been contacted by F&Aacute;S to submit a portfolio of evidence  under recognition of prior learning;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />44 apprentices have been considered for the Advanced Craft Certificate by the  National  Apprentice Advisory Sub-Committee with 26 being approved.</P>

	<P>Currently over 97% of all schools are availing of the broadband service. Of the  remaining 3% there are 59 schools who have opted out of the scheme and the  remaining schools are awaiting installation in the coming months as part of the  roll out of new broadband for schools contracts.  </P>
        <P>At any point in time there will be schools which are part of the schools  broadband programme without a broadband connection due to technology problems  (e.g. line of sight, building works, phone lines deteriorating) the numbers  for  which are constantly changing.  All faults are resolved in the quickest  time possible.</P>
        <P>There are a number of schools i.e. 32 which are presently without a connection  due to transferring from Smart Satellite System which was discontinued at the  end of May 2010 (Smart Satellite was acquired by Digiweb in December 2009).  An  additional 14 schools which are a combination of new schools and schools where  a fault has developed are without connection.   In order to connect these  schools new equipment i.e. a router, is required.  My Department is awaiting  delivery of this equipment which is scheduled for the middle of June.  There  has been a delay in delivery which the suppliers have indicated is due to a  component shortage in the industry in general.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, established the National Educational Welfare  Board (NEWB) with statutory responsibility to ensure that each child attends a  recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The remit  of the Board was expanded in 2009 to include responsibility for the Visiting  Teacher Service for Travellers (VTST), the Home School Community Liaison  Service (HSCL) and the School Completion Programme (SCP) as well as the  National Educational Welfare Service (EWS) under one common management team.  The new integrated approach will provide for better targeting of children who  are not benefiting from education and it will ensure that these children are  properly supported to maximise their educational potential. It also provides  new opportunities for enhanced support for parents and families.</P>
        <P>The Board&rsquo;s network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) is the means by  which the Board delivers on its statutory remit to ensure that each child  attends and benefits from education. EWOs work with approximately 8,000  children each year, who are reported as having serious school attendance or  school placement difficulties or who have been expelled from schools. They work  closely with the family, the school and other support services to address the  particular issues for each child. The needs of children can vary considerably  from those who are not attending school to those for whom there is no school  place, while in other cases, placement in an alternative education programme  like Youthreach may be more appropriate.</P>
        <P>The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a  recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The NEWB  has a key role in supporting  parents where there are problems with school  placement or attendance difficulties of their children in school. In addition  the NEWB has, in the past, issued information leaflets to parents and run  public awareness campaigns to raise the profile of school attendance. It also  operates an Education Helpline to provide information on attendance and related  matters.</P>
        <P>Where difficulties with school placement include issues of special educational  need staff of the Board and the National Council for Special Education have  developed operational protocols to ensure that these difficulties are resolved.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for the  provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for  students with special educational needs. In particular, its network of Special  Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education  provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational  services. They act as single points of contact for parents of students with  special educational needs. Another specific function of the SENO is to identify  appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.  My Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally  regarding pupils&rsquo; education. All schools have the names and contact details of  their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to <Col N="683"/>discuss  their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on  www.ncse.ie.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or  guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or, in the case of a  Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school, to the VEC in the first  instance; where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf  of the Board, permanently excludes a student, or suspends a student for a  period greater than 20 days.</P>
        <P>In relation to appeals lodged with the Secretary General of my Department, only  where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my  Department direct a school to re-instate a pupil. In 2009, 72 Section 29  Appeals, lodged with the Secretary General were completed, broken down between  primary and post primary schools as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Permanent Exclusion 64 (Post Primary 56) (Primary 8);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Suspensions  8 (Post Primary 7) (Primary 1).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The NEWB&rsquo;s &lsquo;Developing a Code of Behaviour: Guidelines for Schools&rsquo; has been  issued to all schools and are part of the Board&rsquo;s overall strategy to support  school attendance and participation. They have been issued in compliance with  section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, which legally obliges each  school to have a Code that is available to students and parents.</P>
        <P>The school Code of Behaviour is the set of programmes, practices and procedures  that together form the school&rsquo;s plan for helping students in the school to  behave well and learn well. The Code of Behaviour helps the school community to  promote the policies, procedures and practices that encourage good behaviour  and prevent unacceptable behaviour. The NEWB Guidelines recognise the  importance of the leadership of Boards of Management and Principals and they  place a welcome emphasis on the value of engaging everyone in the school  community, including teachers, parents and pupils in the task of shaping the  school environment and making it a positive place for teaching and learning.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department operates a Home Tuition Scheme  which allocates funding to parents to provide tuition at home for children who,  for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme funds tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement  where a school-based placement is not available. Information on the scheme  including criteria for eligibility for tuition is detailed annually by circular  to schools and parents.The home tuition scheme facilitates ongoing minimum  education until a suitable long term solution is put in place by the Board.</P>

	<P>I wish to confirm for the Deputy that the school&rsquo;s Learning Support/Resource  teacher is currently providing 2.5 hours resource teaching support per week to  the pupil in question. In addition, the pupil is also supported in the  classroom through the special needs assistant scheme. </P>
        <P>All primary schools were allocated Learning Support/Resource Teaching support  through the General Allocation Model. These teaching resources were provided in  order to enable schools provide additional teaching support to pupils who have  learning support needs or who have been assessed as having a high incidence  disability. I understand that the pupil&rsquo;s special educational needs fall to be  supported from the General Allocation Model.</P><Col N="684"/>
        <P>Prior to the introduction of the General Allocation Model, schools had to apply  for additional teaching support for each pupil with an assessed disability.  However, the introduction of the General Allocation Model means that schools no  longer have to make applications for additional teaching support for pupils  with a high incidence disability as the Learning Support/Resource teachers are  already available in the school.</P>

	<P>In late 2008, as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, a  number of matters came to my attention with regard to the F&Aacute;S Science Challenge  Initiative and I commissioned a review of this programme. </P>
        <P>The review concluded that the Initiative had been of some benefit to the  personal and career development of some of its participants and had resulted in  beneficial links between institutions in the United States and those in  Ireland.  However, as a F&Aacute;S-run programme the review also found that the  Initiative was outside the main remit of the Agency and in itself had not  represented best value for money on the basis of efficiency, effectiveness and  economy.  The review also concluded that there was no evidence to show that the  Initiative had contributed to the systemic goals of the Government&rsquo;s Strategy  for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006-13.</P>
        <P>Given these conclusions and the need for F&Aacute;S to concentrate on its core remit  of providing training and employment opportunities, I directed my then  Department to make the necessary arrangements for the commencement of the  orderly wind down of the Science Challenge Initiative once all existing  commitments for the 2008/2009 academic year had been met.  This has now been  carried out.</P>

        <P>In his speech in the D&aacute;il on 23 March the Taoiseach announced a number of  Ministerial and Departmental changes designed to ensure closer alignment of the  Government&rsquo;s economic objectives to the administrative functions of its  departments and agencies.  As part of these changes the Employment Programmes  and Services and Skills Training (Transfer of Departmental Administration and  Ministerial Functions) Order of 2010, which came into force on 1 May 2010,  reallocated responsibility for F&Aacute;S as an Agency and its funding related to  training and skills from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to  my Department. <Col N="685"/> Responsibility for the employment service and community service  activities of F&Aacute;S and its related funding has also transferred to my  Department.  However, it is proposed that the Department of Social Protection  will assume funding and overall responsibility of F&Aacute;S employment and community  services once the primary legislation necessary to achieve this has been  enacted.  It is hoped that this legislation will be passed before the summer  recess.</P>
        <P>Looking further ahead, my colleague the Minister for Social Protection intends  to bring forward more detailed legislative proposals at an early date to  provide for the full integration of the employment services and community  services programmes of F&Aacute;S with his Department.</P>

	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers has applied for large scale capital  funding for a new school. The application has been assessed in accordance with  the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and  assigned a band rating of 2.2.</P>
        <P>Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all  assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred  to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department&rsquo;s website at  www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published  prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the  Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of  which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching  to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my  Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The next step with this project is for a design team to be appointed. On 16  February last, details of large scale capital projects where design teams will  be appointed in this year under my Department&rsquo;s Capital programme for 2010 were  announced.  It was not possible to include this project in this announcement.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in  the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget  of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) advises the Government on  current and future skills needs and on other labour market issues that impact  on Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise and employment growth. The Group brings together  industry, academia and State agencies in identifying the overall skills  requirements in the economy. My Department and its education and training  agencies are represented on the Group and the Group&rsquo;s research and reports  provide a valuable input to the development and amendment of course curricula.</P>
        <P>The EGFSN annually produces the National Skills Bulletin, which identifies  skills shortages in the economy each year. Given the sharp rise in  unemployment, there is an excess supply of labour in Ireland at present. As a  result, no significant labour shortages have been identified in 2010. However,  the incidence of skills shortages is very low. These relate to a small number  of posts and are confined to specialists within an occupation (e.g. electrical  engineers with an expertise in high voltage grids), senior positions (e.g.  senior software developer), niche areas (e.g. telesales with Nordic languages)  and a specific skill mix (e.g. ICT and business).</P>
        <P>Current Government policy is not to issue new employment permits to persons  from outside the State where the salary is less than &euro;30,000. This includes  those employed in the meat industry sector. New permit applications are only  issued on an exceptional basis where employers have been unsuccessful in their  genuine efforts to recruit suitable candidates from within the labour force of  the European Economic Area. That is why only 12 new permits have been issued  this year for butchers and boners compared with the 297 that were issued in  2008.</P>
        <P>The State&rsquo;s education and training providers routinely engage with industry in  the design and development of new courses to ensure that they are a wide range  of courses relevant to the skill needs of enterprises including those in the  manufacturing and meat processing sectors.</P>
        <P>For instance, F&Aacute;S has developed a number of training and assessment programmes  such as beef abattoir worker, pig meat abattoir worker and pig/meat deboner.  F&Aacute;S has also developed in conjunction with legislative bodies and industry  stakeholders, a new Irish standard for Animal Welfare in Meat Processing that  is recognised by An Bord Bia and is essential for all plants handling live  animals.</P>
        <P>My Department is also providing grant aid support this year of &euro;112,000 to the  craft-butchering sector through the current Skillnets Training Networks  Programme. This is the continuation of a long-standing supportive relationship  to develop and upskill those employed in the sector.</P>
        <P>In terms of education both the Higher and Further education sectors are  providing participants with specific skills to enhance their prospects of  securing lasting, full-time employment, or progression to other studies.  Examples of such programmes include the plc programme, VTOS, Youthreach and  third and fourth level provision delivered through the Institutes of Technology  and the Universities.</P>
        <P>In addition, 1,800 unemployed people were supported to embark on part-time  undergraduate and postgraduate programmes from September 2009 in areas that  support the goals of the &lsquo;Smart Economy&rsquo; and identified by the EGFSN as being  relevant to the skills needs of the manufacturing and internationally traded  services sector. A preliminary analysis by the HEA of information received to  date from participating institutions shows that some 50% of participants were  previously employed in the engineering, manufacturing or construction sectors.   55% <Col N="688"/>of participants indicated that their motivation for undertaking the  programme was to enhance their career prospects.</P>

	<P>The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department&rsquo;s website. </P>
        <P>In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for  determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil  enrolment at 30 September. The final position for any one school will depend on  a number of other factors such as the allocation of support teachers,  additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as  a result of the appeals processes. The final number of teachers for the coming  school year will not be known until the allocation process is fully completed  around November 2010.</P>
        <P>Pupil numbers at both primary and post-primary level continue to increase and  this results in an increased requirement for additional teachers for the  foreseeable future. The renewed Programme for Government contains a commitment  to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level  schools for the lifetime of this Government and also the provision of 500  additional teaching posts between primary and second levels over a three year  period. The first tranches of these additional posts have been allocated to  schools following consultations with the education partners.</P>
        <P>Extensive statistical information is available on my Department&rsquo;s website in  relation to class sizes and pupil teacher ratios.  It is early to speculate at  this stage on the pupil teacher ratio trend for the 2010-2011 school year.  However I would not expect it to be significantly different from recent years  because, notwithstanding the general moratorium on public sector recruitment,  the Government has agreed to allow schools to increase their teacher numbers to  cater for demographic growth.</P>
        <P>It is also important to note that from an educational perspective numerous  influential reports have highlighted the fact that teacher quality is the  single most important factor &mdash; far and above anything else &mdash; in improving  educational outcomes for children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the arrangements currently in place for school  transport annual charges, namely &euro;300 per eligible and concessionary post  primary pupil, &euro;200 for concessionary primary pupil, or a maximum family charge  of &euro;650 will remain in place for the 2010/2011 school year.</P>
        <P>Discussions on the 2011 estimates have begun and the recommendations in the  McCarthy report, including school transport charges, will be considered as part  of this process. Any changes to the school transport charges will continue to  take account of children where the family is in possession of a valid medical  card.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the McCarthy report made recommendations to  levy charges, at both primary and post primary level, at a rate of &euro;500 per  annum per child or 50% of the full economic cost of providing the service. The  exemption for social welfare recipients would continue to apply.</P>
        <P>A maximum family rate of &euro;650 also applies. The total contribution of charges  from parents in 2009 still only represents about 7% of the overall expenditure  for school transport.</P>
        <P>The current school transport charges compare very favourably with the charges  being levied in respect privately contracted school bus services. While the  charges vary, some parents are paying between &euro;20 and &euro;25 per child per week  which equates to  &euro;732 and &euro;915 per primary child per school year and &euro;668 and  &euro;835 per post primary child per school year.</P>
        <P>Given the significant investment by the State in this scheme &mdash; &euro;186 million in  2010 &mdash; and in order to ensure optimum efficiency it is a matter of concern for  the Department that some parents of eligible children would be allocated  tickets, thereby reserving individual seats for each child, and then  subsequently do not make full use of these seats daily during the full school  year. The focus of any changes would be on ensuring optimum efficiency and  regular usage of the services provided.</P>
        <P>The school transport service is delivered using a mix of Bus &Eacute;ireann, both  school transport and road passenger vehicles, private contractor vehicles  including private operator scheduled services, and Dublin Bus, Irish Rail, DART  and LUAS where practical. The scheme therefore encourages a significant  reduction in daily usage of individual cars, and as a consequence also reduces  carbon emissions by parents transporting their children to school.</P>
        <P>In a new initiative, Bus &Eacute;ireann has partnered with the Sustainable Energy  Authority of Ireland to introduce eco-driving and other energy efficiency  methods in order to benefit the environment and make energy savings. Bus  &Eacute;ireann has become a member of SEAI&rsquo;s Energy Exemplar Partnership Programme,  which will see it introduce a number of energy management initiatives as part  of the public sector target of a 33 per cent improvement in energy efficiency  by 2020.</P>
        <P>One of these initiatives, which Bus &Eacute;ireann is currently piloting, is  Eco-driving. Eco-driving is an internationally tested method of reducing  vehicle fuel consumption by making adjustments to driving style and  performance. Studies have shown that savings of between 5 and 20 per cent on  fuel consumption can be achieved through eco-driving. In addition to reducing  fuel consumption and vehicle emissions, Eco-driving can reduce vehicle  operating costs including maintenance and depreciation costs.</P><Col N="690"/>
        <P>In a wider context, the Government&rsquo;s Smarter Travel policy, which is led by my  colleague the Minister for Transport, pursues the need to deliver a sustainable  travel and transport system by 2020, including in relation to school travel.</P>
        <P>Since the publication of the Smarter Travel Policy in February last year, work  has begun on developing a national cycle competency accreditation for  schoolchildren. In addition, a stakeholder advisory group has been set up in  relation to the delivery of the Green Schools Travel Programme.</P>
        <P>My colleague the Minister for Transport, continues to provide financial support  for the Green Schools Travel Programme through the National Transport  Authority. This programme reached 144,000 schoolchildren in 482 schools by the  end of 2009 and yielded an average reduction of 22% in children travelling to  school by car. The approved national programme aims to reach 260,000  schoolchildren by 2012.</P>

	<P>Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory programme for junior  cycle since September 2003. In addition, all schools are required to have an  RSE programme at senior cycle.</P>
        <P>Schools are currently supported in the implementation of RSE by the SPHE and  RSE Support Services which are provided in collaboration with the health  sector. The supports available to schools include guidelines on policy  development, curricula and teacher guidelines, comprehensive resource manuals,  and teacher training.</P>
        <P>In 2008 the report &ldquo;RSE in the context of SPHE : An assessment of the  Challenges to the Full Implementation of the Programme in Post-primary Schools&rdquo;  published jointly by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and my Department was  launched.  The report highlighted widespread support for both the broad   principles and the content of the SPHE and RSE programme from teachers, parents  and health professionals and strong levels of interest and support from parents  and students as to the importance of RSE in schools. The report also  demonstrated increasing levels of implementation compared with earlier studies,  with 90% of schools teaching RSE at some level. However, levels of  implementation significantly reduced in senior cycle, with 43% and 48% of  schools indicating that RSE was not taught in Leaving Certificate Year 1 and  Leaving Certificate Year 2 respectively.</P>
        <P>The report also indicated that some topics such as contraception, sexually  transmitted infections and sexual orientation were inconsistently treated in  schools.</P>
        <P>Following this, my Department issued a circular to all schools reminding them  of the obligation to provide SPHE in all classes each year at junior cycle and  to provide an RSE programme in senior cycle, and re-stating the supports and  resources available for this.</P>
        <P>A further Lifeskills Survey was issued to all schools for completion in 2009  seeking information on various aspects of social personal and health education.  To date, the responses have been completed by 459 schools and indicate that RSE  is being implemented in 85-87% of schools in junior cycle, and in 53-59% of  schools in senior cycle. In the meantime, lesson plans linked to a DVD resource  on contraception, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation, have  been developed for schools in collaboration with the Health Services Execu<Col N="692"/>tive  and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to ensure consistency of treatment of these  issues within RSE.</P>
        <P>My Department plans to issue a further reminder to all schools on this issue in  September. Evaluation of  Social Personal and Health Education and RSE in  schools by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate has also been strengthened, both  through subject inspections and whole school evaluation.</P>

	<P>When the moratorium was introduced the Government exempted Principal and Deputy  Principal appointments in all primary and post-primary schools and these  continue to be replaced in the normal manner. The impact of the moratorium is  therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties allowances  payable to teachers on promotion.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that the impact of the moratorium on middle management posts has  applied unevenly in schools depending on the level of retirements. Discussions  are ongoing with the Department of Finance in relation to some limited  alleviation for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the  moratorium. Schools will be advised of the outcome of the discussions at the  earliest possible stage so that they can plan ahead for the coming school year.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for school authorities to re-organise and prioritise, as best as  possible, the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the  context of implementing the moratorium.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  </P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department received a lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 23 April, 2010.  This claim awaits processing.  In respect of redundancy lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from September/October 2009.</P>
        <P>The impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the level of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department.  This has impacted significantly on the capacity to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  On the Redundancy side the scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 <Col N="693"/>which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax  liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008.  During the period 1 January 2010 to 30 April, 2010, 23,593 claims were received and 27,592 were processed.  In the year to date, inroads have been made on the backlog of claims on hand, which reduced from 41,168 at the end of January to 36,333 at the end of April 2010.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, with effect from 1 January 2006, relief for interest on borrowed money applied in the purchase, improvement or repair of a rented residential premises and relief for qualifying expenditure incurred under the Countrywide Refurbishment Scheme is denied unless the claimant can show that the registration requirements of Part 7 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 have been complied with in respect of all tenancies which relate to the premises in question. In relation to relief for interest, the registrations requirements must be complied with for all tenancies that exist for the premises for the year the relief is claimed.</P>
        <P>These measures were introduced by Finance Act 2006 and followed from a commitment given at the time of the debates on the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 that entitlement to any tax incentives or reliefs should be dependent on compliance with the applicable regulatory controls and to the registering of tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).</P>
        <P>I understand that Revenue advertised these changes in the national newspapers in September 2006. I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have provided relevant information on these measures in a number of publications, for example, Tax Briefing 63, A Guide <Col N="696"/>to the Countrywide Refurbishment Scheme, Revenue eBrief No. 54/2007 and Revenue&rsquo;s Guide to Rental Income (IT 70).

	<P>There are three General Lighthouse Authorities (GLA&rsquo;s ), which are responsible for providing and maintaining Aids-To Navigation in the UK and Ireland. The three GLA&rsquo;s are Commissioners for Irish Lights (responsible for the 32 counties of Ireland), Trinity House Lighthouse Service (responsible for England and Wales) and the Northern Lighthouse Board (responsible for Scotland and the Isle of Man).  The functions of the GLA&rsquo;s are governed by the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, an act of the UK parliament.</P>
        <P>The entire system of lights around the coasts of Britain and Ireland is administered as a single financial unit, known as the General Lighthouse Fund (GLF). The GLF is controlled by the UK Department for Transport. As a result, the three GLA&rsquo;s are under it&rsquo;s aegis. Due to this unique link, the Aids-to Navigation Division of the Department of Transport monitors, but does not control the activities of CIL.  In view of these reporting and funding arrangements it is not appropriate at this time to bring the Commissioners for Irish Lights in under the FOI Act.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the application dated 7 May 2010 was received by Revenue on 18 May 2010.  On 20 May, a letter issued to the agent confirming that the company had been registered for Corporation Tax and that the VAT application was currently being processed.  On examination of the application, further information is required to complete the VAT registration. A letter to this effect issued to the agent on 1 June 2010.</P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s Customer Service Standards, published in August 2009, sets a target to register 100% of VAT registrations within 10 working days.  The 10 working day standard for VAT registrations takes into account an extra level of scrutiny carried out by Revenue to ensure that the VAT registration is in respect of a legitimate business.</P>
        <P>In the period March to April 2009, 93% of VAT Registrations were dealt with within 10 working days.  During the corresponding period in 2010, 94% of VAT Registrations were dealt with within 10 working days.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 48 together.</P>
        <P>I announced in the Budget that a carbon tax at a rate &euro;15 per tonne would be introduced on fossil fuels. It should be noted that a carbon tax came into effect on 10 December 2009 in respect of petrol and auto-diesel and from 1 May 2010 to kerosene, marked gas oil (also known as &lsquo;green diesel&rsquo; or &lsquo;agricultural diesel&rsquo;), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas. The application of the tax to coal and commercial peat is subject to a Commencement Order.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in accordance with section 10(1) of the Value-Added Tax Act 1972 (as amended), the amount on which Value-Added Tax is chargeable is the total consideration receivable by the supplier, &ldquo;including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges whatsoever&rdquo; but not including the Value-Added Tax itself.</P>
        <P>VAT is an EU-wide tax and Irish VAT law must comply with the EU VAT Directives.  Article 78 of EU Council Directive 2006/112/EC provides that the taxable amount shall include &ldquo;taxes, duties, levies and charges, excluding the VAT itself&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, it is correct to include any carbon tax element of a gas bill in the amount on which VAT is chargeable.  The same situation applies in the case of other excises, including for example excises on petrol, auto-diesel, tobacco and alcohol products.</P>
        <P>A <i>Guide to Natural Gas Carbon Tax</i> has been issued by the Revenue Commissioners and there were consultations on all aspects of the tax with natural gas suppliers in preparation for its implementation.  In addition, guidance in relation to the VAT treatment of the total consideration receivable by a supplier is set out in the <i>VAT Guide</i>.  Both publications are available on the Revenue website &mdash; www.revenue.ie.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposals to which the Deputy refers are in the main a reproduction of the material supplied by the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) to its member credit unions as part of its current campaign in relation to amendments to Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 contained in the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 and to the transposition by Ireland of the Consumer Credit Directive.  I understand that the intention of the campaign is that all members of the House are to be lobbied on these issues.</P><Col N="698"/>
        <P>The ILCU campaign material makes a number of points.   I met with the credit union representative bodies last week and I am listening to their concerns.  Arising from those meetings, my Department, in conjunction with the Registrar of Credit Unions, is examining the scope for linking more closely the powers conferred by the new Section 35A to the framework required for implementing the new rescheduling arrangements.  I will be meeting the representative bodies again within the next week or so to outline the results of that examination.</P>
        <P>When the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 was published on 30 March this year, ILCU welcomed the new initiative in its press release that day stating &lsquo;This new arrangement is good for our members and good for credit unions&rsquo;.  ILCU has since formed a different view.  That is, of course, its right.  The credit union sector is not immune to the economic downturn. It needs to be safeguarded to ensure that it can continue to provide assistance to its members in the current difficult economic climate while at the same time lending only within its capacity to do so.  The Government&rsquo;s intention is to facilitate relaxation of the lending limits in conjunction with appropriate regulation of the sector to achieve this objective.</P>
        <P>In my address to the ILCU Conference in April 2009, I expressed my wish to help members who are experiencing difficulty in meeting loan repayments due to unfavourable changes in their financial circumstances in the current economic environment.  I stated that any solution would be subject to the over-arching consideration that the financial position of a credit union is not undermined, the security of members&rsquo; savings is maintained and accurate reporting of the financial status of a credit union is not jeopardised.  Re-scheduling of repayments to a level which is affordable to members should be possible in carefully monitored and controlled circumstances.  Of course, each credit union must fully and properly recognise arrears situations where they exist.   Where members are in difficulty the process of facilitating them must be transparent to board members and regulators so that a credit union is never in doubt as to its own position.  This continues to be my view and the proposed amendment to Section 35 seeks to achieve the desired result.</P>
        <P>The credit union sector has been seeking relaxation of the Section 35 lending limits in an effort to facilitate borrowers who have run into difficulties in repaying their loans and need to have them rescheduled to allow for repayment over a longer period of time.  The lending limits are set in primary legislation.  Together with the measures to balance the increased flexibility in relation to rescheduling, they must apply to all credit unions in a uniform way.  However, as I have indicated above, my Department and the Registrar are exploring ways of meeting the key concerns of the representative bodies.</P>
        <P>Also, as I indicated to the House during the second stage debate on the Bill, the Registrar of Credit Unions will take a balanced and proportionate approach to the implementation of any new Section 35 requirements and he has set out for the credit union representative groups transitional arrangements and clarifications on the implementation approach.  The Registrar has already indicated that these include transitional arrangements for a 15% provisioning requirement up to 30 September 2011, trial periods, exceptions with regard to top-up loans and relaxation of the 100% provisioning requirement in respect of rescheduled loans which have missed two or more payments.  The transitional arrangements will help to ease the position for credit unions in the current financial year and the next financial year ending in September 2011. They will also allow time for credit unions to adjust to the new regime. Overall, the Registrar will take account of individual circumstances in credit unions in exercising the powers being given to him in the Bill.   I want to assure the Deputy that there is no question of a <i>&rsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; </i>approach as is being suggested by the League.</P><Col N="699"/>
        <P>It is not correct to say that the Registrar has the necessary powers under existing legislation.   He does not have the power to impose conditions across the sector and it would not be prudent to await the outcome of the strategic review.  While the review itself is planned to be completed by March 2011, any primary legislation arising would require some considerable further time to implement.  As I have indicated already, the credit union sector needs to be safeguarded further now to ensure that it can continue to provide assistance to its members in the current difficult economic climate while at the same time lending only within its capacity to do so.</P>
        <P>As indicated by the Registrar during his appearance last week before the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs, a Regulatory Impact Assessment within the meaning of the term as set out in the Better Regulation Guidelines prepared by the Department of the Taoiseach was not carried out.  However, as he also indicated, an internal analysis was carried out. This examined the level of provisions which are held against rescheduled loans.  The Registrar indicated that he will make this analysis available to the Joint Committee.  I will ask the Registrar to furnish the Deputy with a copy of any material which he provides to the Joint Committee in this regard.</P>
        <P>Contrary to suggestions now being made, there was extensive and detailed consultation on the measures now being brought forward.  Following general discussions in early 2009, the detailed views of credit union representative groups on the Section 35 issue were sought and obtained in the summer of 2009.  The provisions to be included in the requirements to be made by the Registrar have already undergone considerable adjustment following discussions between the Registrar of Credit Unions and both credit union representative bodies.</P>
        <P>Concerns have been raised in relation to the need for the Registrar of Credit Unions to consult with the representative bodies before introducing requirements.   As a matter of general practice, the Registrar consults with the credit union representative bodies before introducing regulations or requirements in relation to any aspect of credit union regulation and I understand that he intends to continue with this approach.  However, the independent position of the Registrar of Credit Unions in carrying out the duty of financial regulation is not open to question and the Registrar has the statutory powers and responsibility to introduce, if necessary without consultation, regulatory requirements in the interests of the well-being and stability of the sector.  For this good reason, a requirement for the Registrar to consult with the sector is not included in the legislation.  Neither is it appropriate to provide for an appeals mechanism.  Such a device would render the provisions ineffective and inoperable as decisions of the Registrar would become subject to constant review.</P>
        <P>There is a balance to be struck between meeting members&rsquo; needs to reschedule loans and ensuring the stability of the credit union sector overall.  We are not seeking to have a credit union sector which is over-regulated.  However, we must act now in a prudent and preventative manner.  It is in the interests of every credit union in the country that the stability of the sector is safeguarded. The proposals being brought forward in connection with the Bill will achieve this fundamental aim.</P>
        <P>The Consumer Credit Directive establishes a harmonised legal framework in the European Union for the provision of consumer credit ranging from 200 euro up to 75,000 euro. (It does not apply to mortgages). It replaces a 1987 Directive (87/102/EEC), which laid down minimum rules for consumer credit arrangements within the EU.</P>
        <P>In consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, my Department is currently preparing the draft Statutory Instrument, which will transpose the Directive into Irish Law.  It is intended that the legislation will be finalised by 11 June 2010.  The Directive will take effect from that day.</P><Col N="700"/>
        <P>I believe that the Directive enhances the strong regulatory regime underpinning consumer protection, and as such, I have decided that credit unions should be subject to its full application.</P>
        <P>However, following consultation with representatives of the Credit Union movement, I am aware that the credit unions will require some time to upgrade their systems and train staff, so that they can effect compliance with all the requirements of the Directive. Consequently, I have adopted the discretion allowed for under Article 2.5 applying limited provisions of the Directive to them until 11 December 2011, after which date, the full Directive will take effect.</P>
        <P>Notification of my decision to adopt this discretion was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 21 May 2010 and both credit union representative bodies were informed of my decision by e-mail on that date.</P>

	<P>Under the provisions of the Tax Acts, a person in receipt of rental income is assessed to income tax on the net amount of the rents received (i.e. the gross rents less allowable expenses incurred in earning those rents). In computing the net amount of the rents received, only those deductions that are specified in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 are allowable. The main deductible expenses are: &middot; Any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;</P>

         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property; and</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Payment of local authority rates in the case of rateable properties used for commercial purposes.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As payment of the new local authority charge for residential properties is not included on the list of allowable deductions, it is not an allowable expense in computing taxable rental income.</P>
        <P>This issue like all proposals for new tax or expenditure measures will fall to be considered in the context of ongoing development of budgetary and economic policy.</P>

	<P>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is given statutory responsibility for the inspection of hospitals under the Health Act, 2007. I have been informed by the Authority that it continues to monitor compliance with National Hygiene Services Quality Standards. This takes the form of ongoing unannounced visits to randomly selected acute hospitals, with this series of inspections focusing specifically on the day to day delivery of hygiene services, particularly in the areas of cleanliness, hand hygiene and waste and linen management practices. Following each visit, a detailed report is provided to each hospital to inform them of areas of strength and areas for further improvement. These reports are published on the HIQA website to provide patients and the public with detailed information on the hygiene services in each hospital. No reports have been published for hospitals in Tipperary North in 2010.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Act, 2007, statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of HIQA for inspecting and registering of residential services for children, older people and people with disabilities. I have been informed by HIQA that between 1 January and 28 May 2010, the Authority undertook a total of 11 inspections in 10 designated centres for older people in Tipperary North. There are 7 centres which have not yet been inspected in Tipperary North.  With regard to the findings of HIQA inspections, all inspection reports are available for download from www.hiqa.ie.

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s decision to limit the funding available to the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) was made in view of the current position of the public finances and the 60% increase in expenditure in the DTSS over the past five years.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has introduced measures to contain DTSS expenditure at the 2008 level of approximately &euro;63 million.</P>
        <P>Under the new measures the range of treatments available are being prioritised. Some treatments which had previously been available in the Scheme, for example, dental cleaning and polishing have been suspended.  Other treatments, such as oral examinations and fillings, will continue to be provided but will be limited in number or frequency. More complex, non-routine treatments, such as protracted periodontal treatments, will be available only in the case of clinical emergencies. These measures have been introduced to protect access to emergency dental care for medical card holders and to safeguard services for children and special needs groups. The HSE will monitor the ongoing effect of these changes from a clinical and budgetary perspective. The dental and oral health services currently provided through the HSE Public Dental Service will not be affected by these changes to the DTSS.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that due to industrial action affecting the Health Service Executive it is not possible for the Executive to supply the specific information concerning the operation of HSE services as requested.  If this matter remains of continuing concern to you, however, I would invite you to raise it with me again in due course.</P>

The HSE is aware of the challenges which the reduction in allocations will present to organisations in ensuring they <Col N="705"/>meet the needs of service users and in planning for emergencies that arise throughout the year.  It also recognises that  maintaining service levels within available resources will require significant levels of co-operation, change, flexibility and creativity.  All disability service providers in the Limerick area have been requested to advise and discuss, with HSE management, challenges they are experiencing, prior to cuts/changes to service provision being implemented. There are also plans to develop a local forum of all service providers (both physical and sensory and intellectual disability), with a focus on the needs of service users now and in the future.</P>

	<P>Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital is committed to providing the full level of services that it promised in its 2010 Service Plan.  It is addressing the challenge of delivering a high quality service to its patients, while remaining within budget.  This may involve decisions in relation to the closure of wards or other services.</P>
        <P>However, the number of patients on the orthopaedic waiting list at the hospital has reduced by 39% since May 2009.  At that time, there were 287 patients on the orthopaedic waiting list.  In May 2010, this number has reduced significantly to 174 patients.</P>
        <P>In May 2010, the HSE announced its intention to relocate orthopaedic services, including elective in-patient, rehabilitation trauma and day surgery, from St. Mary&rsquo;s Orthopaedic Hospital to the South Infirmary/Victoria University Hospital, Cork. It is also intended, following the move, to recommence orthopaedic surgery for children locally.  Currently all orthopaedic surgery for children from the southern region is carried out at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin.</P>
        <P>The HSE is working closely with all three paediatric hospitals in Dublin to ensure that the resources available for orthopaedic surgery are deployed to the best effect and to minimise waiting times for all children. The HSE is also engaged on a project to maximise theatre utilisation across the three paediatric hospital sites.  This is intended to assist further in the improvement of waiting times for orthopaedic surgery.</P>

	<P>The improvement of access to outpatient services, a key access point to the acute hospital system and involving over three million attendances annually, is a priority for the health service.  It is essential that people are afforded timely access to outpatient services when they require them and that these services function effectively as part of an integrated acute hospital and primary care system.</P>
        <P>The HSE is engaged in a number of measures to improve access to and the efficiency of outpatient services.  The principal aims of the National Outpatient Department Service Improvement Programme are to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Increase the number of new patients seen;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Reduce the numbers who do not attend for scheduled appointments (DNAs);</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Reduce waiting times for patients; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Ensure that all patients are seen within 30 minutes of their appointment time.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The HSE is focusing on increasing new attendances in four specialties in 2010: orthopaedics, dermatology, rheumatology and neurology.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s 2010 National Service Plan contains performance targets for OPD services of a 1:2 new-to-return patient ratio and a non-attendance rate of not more than 10%.  In its Service Plan, at my request, the HSE is also committed to the development of new indicators, with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, to measure median waiting time from:</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />GP referral to attendance at outpatient;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Outpatient attendance to admission where this is indicated; and</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />GP referral to hospital admission.</P><Col N="707"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Outpatient waiting list data is currently collected primarily at individual hospital level.  The HSE is therefore working to develop a system which will provide standardised and comparable national outpatient waiting list data, by hospital and specialty.  The availability of such information will facilitate clinicians and health service managers in further improving the performance of outpatient services.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to D&aacute;il Question No: 120 of 22nd April 2010. The fact remains  that this person&rsquo;s case falls under the Dublin II Regulation, (Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003). The Dublin II Regulation, is intended to prevent the phenomenon of &lsquo;asylum shopping&rsquo; across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which Regulation State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one Regulation State. At the same time, it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of &lsquo;refugees in orbit&rsquo;, a situation which had previously pertained in Europe.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, (ORAC), in accordance with the terms of the Dublin II Regulation, determined that Belgium is responsible for examining this person&rsquo;s asylum application, as they had previously made an asylum application there. Belgium has accepted responsibility in this case and I intend to proceed with the transfer in question. This person was requested to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 20/04/2010, she failed to do so and is currently evading her Transfer Order. She should make herself known to them without further delay so that arrangements can be made for her transfer to Belgium.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 30 March 2000.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 13 May 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  Representations were submitted by the person concerned at that time.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of his case, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 28 October 2003.  Notice of this Order was served by registered letter dated 4 December 2003 which placed a legal requirement on the person concerned to present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 11 December 2003 in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State.</P>
        <P>The person concerned initiated Judicial Review proceedings, challenging the decision of the Minister to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  Based on the decision of the Supreme Court in the &lsquo;Nwole&rsquo; case, these proceedings were ultimately &lsquo;settled&rsquo; which resulted in the Deportation Order being quashed.</P>
        <P>On 15 December 2008, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was again advised that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should not have a Deportation Order made against him. Further representations were received on behalf of the person concerned at that time.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was subsequently notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in November 2007.</P>
        <P>All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straightforward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>I am informed that there is a discrepancy between the address the Deputy has provided and the address my Department holds on file. It is the responsibility of the applicant to keep my Department informed of any change of address in writing.</P>

        <P>In exceptional cases an application for an Irish temporary travel document may be considered from a person who has been granted leave to remain in the State and who does not possess a passport.  In all cases, INIS must be satisfied that there is no alternative open to the applicant before an Irish temporary travel document will issue.  The possession of a passport is by far the most secure and easy manner for non nationals living in this State to travel.

	<P>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the procedures to be followed when applying for a temporary travel document are outlined on the website, <b>www.inis.gov.ie</b> where the application form and details of how to apply for a temporary travel document are all available under the headings of &ldquo;Immigration&rdquo; and &ldquo;Travel Documents&rdquo;. </P>
        <P>The person concerned was granted temporary leave to remain in the State in August 2008 for a period of 3 years.  In exceptional cases an application for an Irish temporary travel document may be considered from a person who has been granted leave to remain in the State and does not possess a passport.  In all cases, INIS must be satisfied that there is no alternative open to the applicant before an Irish temporary travel document will issue.  The possession of a passport is by far the most secure and easy manner for non nationals living in this State to travel.  The person concerned has to show that they have made reasonable and formal efforts to obtain a national passport and that it has been formally and unreasonably refused.  Provision of original correspondence from the relevant consular authorities is an essential component when considering any temporary travel document application.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Travel Document Unit of INIS that the person concerned has applied on at least 3 previous occasions for a temporary travel document.  All previous applications were refused as the applications received were not accompanied with the requisite original correspondence from their own consular authorities.</P><Col N="721"/>

The most recent permission to remain granted to the person in question expired on 6 April, 2009.</P>
        <P>I am informed that the person concerned presented at the offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 2 February, 2010 but was not in possession of a valid passport and was unable to provide satisfactory evidence of having been continuously resident in the State.  Consequently, the person in question was advised to write to my Department at INIS, PO Box 10003, Dublin 2, but, to date, has failed to do so.  I am further advised that as the registration card issued by the GNIB to the person concerned, and which she presented on 2 February, 2010 had expired, it was retained by GNIB in accordance with standard procedures.</P>

	<P>I have reported to the House in detail on the questions raised by the Deputy, in the special debate held on Tuesday 1 June.  I made clear the Government&rsquo;s condemnation of the use of military force which has led to the deaths of an estimated ten persons.  I also reported on my meeting with the Israeli Ambassador in which I conveyed the Government&rsquo;s views through him to his authorities.  Further to that debate, I welcomed on 2 June the decision of the Israeli Government to release immediately all those detained on the ships, some of whom have already begun to depart Israel.  I repeated my call to Israel to allow the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, which is still at sea, to deliver its cargo unhindered to Gaza. </P>
        <P>EU High Representative Ashton has made a number of public statements on these events, including clearly condemning the use of violence and demanding an immediate, full and impartial inquiry into the events, which I welcome.  The EU Presidency in Israel has also been active in relation to the consular protection of those detained.  I have asked High Representative Ashton to facilitate a discussion on this issue at the next Foreign Affairs Council on 14 June.  I am also in contact with my EU colleagues on the matter.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>  if consideration has been given to the household outgoings, including mortgage repayments of &euro;1,800 per month in the case of refusal by the Department of disability allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The person concerned applied for disability allowance on 27 August 2009. He was assessed with weekly means of &euro;437.52 based on his spouse&rsquo;s earnings from insurable employment. As this exceeded the then statutory limit of &euro;339.90 per week for payment of disability allowance his claim was refused.</P><Col N="730"/>
        <P>Means are assessed on the claimant&rsquo;s own means and that of their spouse/partner subject to certain exceptions laid down in legislation. Mortgage repayments are not included in these exceptions and are therefore not deductible when assessing means.  A letter issued to the person concerned on 7 December 2009 notifying him of this decision and advising him of his right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals office within 21 days.</P>
        <P>The person subsequently lodged an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. Based on the evidence presented the Appeals Officer found that the person failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit applicable and the appeal was disallowed. The Appeal&rsquo;s Officer advised the person of his decision in writing on 20 May 2010.  An Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision is final and conclusive in the absence of any fresh facts or evidence.</P>

        <Quest>  the reason an area (details supplied) in County Mayo is not included in the national broadband scheme in view of the fact that there is no fixed line broadband available there.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Prior to the commencement of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to help determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, could not be included.</P>
        <P>EU State aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</P>
        <P>That mapping exercise found that at least one existing broadband supplier was already active in the area referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question and consequently the locality was excluded from the Scheme.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at www.callcosts.ie</P>
        <P>It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently considering the design and implementation of a scheme which would use this funding to address the issue of basic broadband availability to un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  As the scheme is only at the design stage, there is no application process at this juncture.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 151 to 153, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In September 2007, my Department obtained State Aid clearance from the EU to run a renewable energy feed in tariff scheme (REFIT) for the wind, small hydro, landfill gas and biomass combustion sectors.  Under the terms of the State Aid clearance, new applications could be accepted into the scheme until 31 December 2009.  The Department is currently in <Col N="734"/>the process of preparing a new state aid application to extend the time period of the original REFIT scheme to cover new renewable generation commensurate with meeting our renewable energy target under Directive 2009/28/EC.  As part of this process, an internal review of the terms and conditions of the scheme is being finalised.</P>
        <P>Once the application for extension of the original REFIT scheme has been submitted to the European Commission, applications for REFIT for additional sectors including offshore wind, wave and tidal (ocean), Anaerobic Digestion/Combined Heat and power and biomass combustion including biomass co-firing will be submitted to the Commission.  The tariffs for bio-energy were recently announced following consultation with all relevant stakeholders.  New REFIT applications will be processed without delay following State Aid clearance.</P>

	<P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) published a decision in 2009 that allows for certain renewable, small and low carbon generators to connect to the transmission and distribution grids without going through the full rigours of the &lsquo;Gate&rsquo; process.  This includes small projects, research and development projects and those that qualify as they are deemed to provide benefits of a public nature that merit qualification.  This policy facilitates renewable generators including small bio-energy, wave and tidal generators.  ESB Networks and EirGrid are taking full account of this decision in network and grid planning and roll out.</P>

        <P>In this regard the recently launched F&Aacute;S Work Placement Programme is open to all unemployed people, including graduates with disabilities.

While on the work placement participants retain their social welfare status and entitlements.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S provides funding for two programmes that have been developed by the Association for Higher Education Access and Delivery and are aimed at graduates with a disability.  The Association is an independent non-profit organisation that has worked over the last 20 years to promote full access and participation for graduates.</P>
        <P>The first programme, the Willing Able Mentoring Programme, aims to bring graduates and employers together and promote accessibility to the labour market for graduates with a disability.  This programme is designed as a mentored work placement programme by providing a support system to management, staff and graduates to promote the inclusion of people with a disability in the workplace.  The current proposals also include disability related support to employers participating in the F&Aacute;S Work Placement Programme.</P>
        <P>The second programme, Get Ahead: Get Ready for Work Programme 2010, builds life long career skills for graduates with a disability, enabling them to deal with a labour market that demands mobility.  It also promotes disability awareness among professionals, informing careers advisers on disability issues to allow them to offer a more inclusive service.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach and relevant Ministers, including myself, met with representatives of the religious Congregations that were party to the 2002 Indemnity Agreement, on 15th April.  The context of the meeting was their responses to the call for further substantial contributions following the publication of the Ryan Report and the Report of the Independent Panel appointed by the Government to report on the adequacy of the Congregations&rsquo; statements of resources as a basis for assessing their resources.  A Government Statement was issued following the meeting and the Report of the Panel together with the Congregations&rsquo; individual responses were published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P><Col N="737"/>
        <P>At the meeting, the Taoiseach advised that the Government&rsquo;s view was that it would be a fair and reasonable outcome in all the circumstances for the State and those responsible for the residential institutions, to meet the final costs of responding to residential institutional abuse, which are estimated to reach some &euro;1.36bn, on a 50:50 basis.</P>
        <P>The Congregations are now offering significant additional contributions, which they have valued at &euro;348.51m.  While more detailed work and discussion is necessary with the Congregations in relation to the detail of their property offers, assuming these contributions are fully realised, the Congregations&rsquo; collective contributions to date, when account is taken of the original &euro;128 million contribution under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement, amount to &euro;476.51m.  This leaves a target of over &euro;200 million to reach the 50% share of the overall projected costs, of some &euro;680m.  The Government has requested that additional contributions be provided to the greatest degree possible in cash as a contribution to the planned National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  The Government also  announced its proposal to utilise the cash element of the Congregations&rsquo; current offers of contributions, which will amount to some &euro;110 million over the next few years, to establish a Statutory Fund, in keeping with the all party Motion passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, supporting the proposal for a Trust for the support of victims and to other education and welfare purposes.</P>
        <P>Officials are engaging with each of the Congregations in relation to their current offers and how the objective of a 50:50 sharing of the overall costs will be achieved.  Following consultation with the Congregations and the former residents as to the exact nature of the fund, how it will operate and the uses to which it will be put, the arrangements for the Statutory Fund will be considered by the Government.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy.  It has clearly been a very tragic and difficult period for the family in question.</P><Col N="738"/>
        <P>Section 23 of the Education Welfare Act 2000 requires all schools to have in place a Code of Behaviour.  The Act further requires that such a code be prepared in accordance with the guidelines of the National Education Welfare Board (NEWB).</P>
        <P>These guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying.  Accordingly, all schools must have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of its overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to introduce additional legislation as suggested by the Deputy.  I am, however, intent on supporting schools in tackling bullying.  In this regard, a number measures and supports have been put in place in recent years.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established.</P>
        <P>My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard.  These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.</P>
        <P>In 2007 my Department published, on its website, policy templates for post-primary schools in five key areas, including anti-bullying.  The template documents are not prescriptive, but rather highlight possible approaches and potential material for inclusion in school policies and take account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes. Reference is also made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.</P>
        <P>The National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) was established in 2006 in response to the recommendation in &ldquo;School Matters&rdquo;, the report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools.  The NBSS is currently working with over 70 Post Primary Schools to promote and support positive student behaviour.</P>
        <P>The National Centre for Technology in Education&rsquo;s Webwise Internet Safety initiative includes an integrated educational programme with the following elements:</P>
<P el="5">1. The development of an integrated educational programme in partnership with the SPHE Support Service called &mdash; Be Safe_Be Webwise, which is delivered in the context of the SPHE module on Personal Safety by the SPHE Second Level Support Service.</P>
<P el="5">2. Delivery of Internet Safety Seminars for parents in schools in partnership with the National Parents Council Primary.</P>
<P el="5">3. Provision of Internet safety continuing professional development training for teachers.</P>
<P el="5">4. The Watch Your Space awareness campaign, which was launched in February 2007 seeks to raise awareness and promote safe, responsible practice by young people when online.  The campaign has a strong peer-to-peer perspective and centres on an interactive online service, www.watchyourspace.ie developed by the NCTE.  This site offers practical tips and <Col N="739"/>advice and supports teenagers who use the web.  A key feature is the advice given from teenagers to teenagers on how to cope with the fall-out from abuses and misuse of social networking and picture -sharing websites.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is also part of the SPHE curriculum.  SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.</P>

	<P>My Department publishes extensive statistical information on its website in relation to schools.  This includes information relating to teacher allocations at primary and post-primary level published for the 2009/10 school year.  The Deputy will be aware that teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment.  In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September.  The final position for the 2010/11 school year for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as the allocation of support teachers, additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The final number of additional teachers for the coming school year will not be known until the allocation process is fully completed  around November 2010.</P>
        <P>Pupil numbers at both primary and post-primary level continue to increase and this results in an increased requirement for additional teachers for the foreseeable future.  The renewed Programme for Government contains a commitment to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government and also the provision of 500 additional teaching posts between primary and second levels over a three year period.  The first tranches of these additional posts have been allocated to schools following consultations with the education partners.</P>

	<P>Advice on prescribed material for the Junior and Leaving Cert exams is  submitted to my Department  by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  No texts are prescribed for study by students preparing for Junior Certificate  English. The syllabus allows for an open course, in which teachers are free to choose a range of texts which they consider appropriate for their students.  Texts for inclusion in the lists of prescribed works for study at Leaving Certificate level are chosen by a sub-committee of the course committee for senior cycle English, which in turn ratifies the final selection for each year.  The work is managed by the education officer for English and the poetry in question has been passed to him for consideration by the committee.</P>
        <P>The NCCA regularly receives texts and recommendations about texts for inclusion in courses and they are grateful that authors, teachers and others take such an  active interest in the literature they would like to see our young people study.  Each of these submissions is considered carefully by the relevant committee or sub-committee.  Prescribed texts are notified to schools a number of years in advance and must be notified in time to ensure that educational publishers are in a position to provide an adequate supply of texts.  At this stage, prose and poetry have been prescribed for Leaving Certificate English up to and including the 2014 examinations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195, 211 and 217 together.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education through its network of Special  Education Needs Organisers (SENOs), co-ordinates special needs education  provision at local level. SENOs act as single points of contact for schools and  parents of students with special educational needs. Where a need for additional  specialist settings is identified, SENOs work with schools to sanction the  required special class provision.</P>
        <P>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special  educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</P>
        <P>Children with special educational needs, including the specific conditions  mentioned by the Deputy, have a range of placement options available to them.   Many children with special needs, including those mentioned by the Deputy,  attend mainstream schools alongside their peers.  Depending on the extent of  their special educational need, these children may receive support <Col N="749"/>from the  school&rsquo;s Learning Support teacher and/or additional tuition hours provided by a  Resource teacher and/or support from a Special Needs Assistant.  Resource  teaching hours are sanctioned by the SENO in line with the assessed disability  of the pupils concerned.  Other children with such special educational needs  attend a special class attached to a mainstream school while some children  attend a special school.  These children are supported through lower pupil  teacher ratios and, where necessary, special needs assistants.</P>
        <P>The level and extent of resources provided to support pupils with special  educational needs depend on the precise nature of the special educational need  of the particular pupil. Supports can include the allocation of additional  resource teaching support, special needs assistants, special school transport  arrangements and grants for specialist equipment and/or assistive technology.  School buildings may be adapted where necessary.</P>
        <P>There are now about 20,000 adults in our schools working solely with pupils  with special needs. This includes over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs);  8,600 resource and learning support teachers; over 1,100 special school  teachers and hundreds of other teachers in special classes.</P>
        <P>The enrolment of a child in a school is a matter in the first instance for the  parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment in schools and  therefore the information requested by the Deputy is not available within my  Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 to 202, inclusive, and 208 together.</P>
        <P>The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the  country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a  requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and  post-primary levels over the coming years. This study has been conducted using  data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the  Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs with reference to recent schools&rsquo;  enrolment data. The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary  provision in the coming years is likely to be greatest in more than 40  identified locations across the country based on significant changes to the  demographics of those areas. The Celbridge area (including Straffan) and the  Naas area (including Sallins) are included in these initial identified areas.</P>
        <P>Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out detailed analysis  and reports for each of these locations in order to identify the school  accommodation requirements for each area up to and including the school year  2014/2015. Reports have been completed for the Celbridge area (which includes  Straffan) and the Naas area (which includes Sallins). When the required reports  have been completed for all the initial identified areas Forward Planning  Section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the  remainder of the country. Overall school accommodation requirements in each  area referred to by the Deputy will be analysed as part of this process.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that, as a result of Forward Planning Section&rsquo;s  analysis, it has been decided to commence new primary schools in seven  identified areas in September 2010 to cater for increased demographics. Naas  has been identified as one of these areas and a new Community National School  will commence for the coming school year.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects arising from the analysis  of school accommodation needs will be considered in the context of my  Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> the number of outstanding requests for psychological assessment currently in hand at the various schools throughout the country on a county basis; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24015/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) which is administered by NEPS.</P>
        <P>NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</P><Col N="752"/>
        <P>The introduction of the General Allocation model for primary schools in 2005/06 means that children with high incidence special needs can get access to extra support without having to undergo an individual assessment.</P>
        <P>Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term.  Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist.</P>
        <P>In the case of schools that do not currently have dedicated NEPS psychologists assigned to them, as I already mentioned, such schools have access to psychological assessments through the SCPA.  Under this Scheme, schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologist concerned.</P>
        <P>Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing I would suggest that they should contact the relevant local NEPS Regional Director, for whom contact details are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> the number of children at primary and second level on a county basis throughout the country currently accommodated in prefabricated structures; the locations at which this has prevailed for the longest period; her plans, if any, to replace these buildings in such instances with permanent structures; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24016/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I outlined to the Deputy on 6th May, 2010, in general, my Department approves the purchase or rental of prefabricated classrooms based on need at the time of application.  My Department does not hold information on the numbers of pupils in individual schools who currently occupy temporary accommodation, this depends on the organisation of class groups by the school management within available accommodation and may vary from year to year.</P>
        <P>A change in policy that has been implemented by my Department is to grant aid the purchase (rather than rental) of temporary accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than 3 years.  Furthermore, since July 2008, it is also policy to offer schools being approved for grant aid for temporary accommodation the option to use their capital grant aid to build a permanent classroom(s) rather than purchase a prefab.  These policies will reduce the usage of temporary accommodation and, particularly, the incidence of long term rental of prefabs.</P>

        <P>Information in respect of the current school building programme, along with all assessed applications for major capital works and the status of these applications, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.  However, for the convenience of the Deputy, I am attaching two lists which set out details of school building projects for County Kildare, including the specific areas mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>List A details applications for major capital works from primary and post primary schools in Kildare which are currently at application stage.</P><Col N="754"/>
        <P>List B contains details of building projects in Kildare that are advancing under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Programme and which are at various stages of delivery.</P>
        <P>Details of building projects delivered in Kildare schools over the past 5 years are also included.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including projects for the schools at application stage in Kildare, from initial design through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, due to the level of demand on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of these projects at this time.</P>
        <P>It is open to any school to apply for temporary accommodation pending the delivery of a building project if it is needed.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> the degree to which higher education grants have been paid up to date or otherwise by vocational education committees or local authorities on a county basis throughout the country to date in respect of 2010; the number outstanding from previous years; her plans to streamline, update and expedite the process in the coming year in view of the hardship caused by delays; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The following table details the latest information on the number of new applications awaiting decisions.  The information has been supplied to my Department by the local authorities and the Vocational Education Committees. The information in relation to the applications outstanding from previous years is not available in the format requested by the Deputy as the process of paying third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.  The timing of payment varies between the 66 awarding bodies depending on a number of variables including the volume of applications received, staffing resources and whether or not properly completed application forms have been received. </P>
        <P>I am very conscious of the difficulties created both for grant awarding authorities and for individual students following the unprecedented surge in student grant applications in 2009.  Therefore, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have prioritised a range of initiatives to facilitate speedier processing of grant applications in 2010.</P>
        <P>This includes the introduction of a new, greatly simplified, application form and explanatory notes, which were made available on the studentfinance.ie website in recent weeks, considerably ahead of last year&rsquo;s timeframe.  In addition, I published the grant schemes for 2010 last week, some months ahead of the publication date last year.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently working closely with the VECs and local authorities to advance development of a scaleable on-line application facility for which tenders have already been sought.  My Department is also examining the possibilities for a further roll-out of payments to students by way of electronic funds transfer which proved very successful in the pilot phase in 2009/10.</P>
        <P>The issue of cash flow for grant awarding authorities has also been addressed by my Department through the introduction of an advance payment arrangement.</P>
        <P>Taken together, I am hopeful that all of these measures should serve to assist awarding authorities in the earlier and more efficient processing of student grants this year.</P>

        <Quest> the extent, if any, of incidents of school bullying brought to her attention or of which she and/or her Department otherwise became aware at primary and second level, on a county basis, throughout the country in each of the past five years and to date this year, the procedures put in place in each case by way of follow up; the degree to which steps have been taken or are likely to be taken arising from any such follow up; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24026/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no requirement for local school authorities to report incidents or allegations of bullying to my Department, nor do I believe that this should be the case.  Under the Education Act 1998, legally, all schools are managed, on behalf of the school Patron or Trustees, by school Boards of Management who employ the teachers at the school. Whereas as I, as Minister for Education and Science provide funding and policy direction for schools, neither I, as Minister, or my Department have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course or direction with regards to individual complaint cases, other than in relation to appeals taken against refusal to enrol, suspension, or expulsion, under Section 29 of the Education Act.</P>
        <P>In dealing with complaints the Department&rsquo;s role is to provide advice to parents and students on the operation of schools&rsquo; complaints procedures and to clarify for parents and pupils how grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed.  Accordingly, responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school, as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established and at that level that actions should be taken to address allegations of bullying.</P>
        <P>My Department does receive a number of complaints and queries from parents regarding matters such as bullying, involving schools. It important to highlight that in many instances, parents may be seeking guidance from the Department on how to resolve an issue or an alleged incident within a school.  In 2009 a total of 438 telephone or written complaints/queries were received from parents regarding bullying in schools.  To the end of May 2010 a total of 222 telephone or written complaints/queries have been received from parents regarding bullying in schools.</P>
        <P>Details of complaints are not recorded on a county by county basis. As details of complaints for 2008 and previous years were not recorded by individual topic and nature of complaint, accurate statistical data on the number of complaints or queries received from parents in relation to bullying is not available for these years.</P><Col N="763"/>
        <P>It should be noted that as the term bullying can be difficult to define prescriptively, complaints/queries logged under the category of bullying are done so based on the terminology used by the parent, as opposed to any judgement applied by staff as to the nature of the complaint.  I am, however, anxious to support schools in tackling bullying and it is for that reason that a number supports have been put in place in recent years to assist schools in dealing with this important issue.</P>
        <P>The Board of Management of each school is required to prepare a code of behaviour in accordance with Section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. To assist schools in formulating such a code, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) has developed guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour.  My Department further requires each school to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
        <P>The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.  My Department has also issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.</P>
        <P>My Department has additionally published policy templates for post-primary schools in five key areas, including anti-bullying on its website of as part of our ongoing efforts in this regard. The template documents are not prescriptive, but rather highlight possible approaches and potential material for inclusion in school policies.</P>
        <P>The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour. However, it does take account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes, and reference is also made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for preschool children with autism.</P>
        <P>The maximum allocation for children eligible for tuition where their medical condition impacts their ability to attend school is 10 hours per week and the allocation is based on attendance levels.  The application for home tuition for the child in question was made in this context on 17th May 2010 and approval was granted on 24th May 2010.  There is no facility to sanction tuition retrospectively.  I have arranged for the statistics on the scheme requested by the Deputy to be forwarded to him.</P>

The Higher Education Grant Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.

        <P>The Third Level maintenance grant schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration (pursued in a university or a third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds) in other EU Member States with effect from the 1996/97 academic year.  The extension of the Schemes at that time did not include courses at postgraduate level within EU or to undergraduate courses outside the EU and, accordingly, there is no grant aid available under my Department&rsquo;s student grant schemes for students pursuing studies outside of the EU.</P>

This bundle is in the pre procurement stage. Detailed output specifications and Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) are being finalised and outline planning permission has been received in respect of the eight schools.  Following completion of the pre procurement process, the Bundle will be ready for hand-over to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) for procurement.  The indicative timeframe for the delivery of a PPP school currently stands at approximately 4 years from the date the Bundle is announced.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the exceptional school transport arrangements, which heretofore have been made available to Traveller children only, have been reviewed in line with the Report and Recommendations contained in the Traveller Education Strategy published in 2006.  This Strategy was finalised following a comprehensive consultative process and was overseen by a group which included representation from three national Traveller organisations.  The strategy recommended that both primary and post primary Traveller children should use the mainstream school transport scheme in operation at present.  Only in exceptional circumstances, based on special needs, should special transport be provided as a positive action measure.</P>
        <P>I would emphasise that, in order to provide as much lead in and communication time as possible, my officials set out the Department&rsquo;s intentions on this recommendation and the proposed phasing in of this recommendation at the Traveller Education Strategy Advisory and Consultative Forum in November 2009 and January 2010.  Letters were subsequently issued to all schools with exceptional transport arrangements in February 2010 and the Society of St Vincent de Paul which was involved in the organisation of some services. In addition, the <Col N="768"/>Visiting Teachers for Travellers were provided with detailed briefing on the proposed changes to support their communication work with schools and parents.</P>
        <P>These changes will mean for all schools involved, including the school referred to by the Deputy, that:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />From the commencement of the 2010/2011 school year, the general terms of the school transport scheme are being implemented for Traveller pupils newly entering primary and post primary level, including siblings of the current group;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />The current exceptional arrangements for a number of children already attending primary and post primary schools who do not meet the distance criteria will cease at the beginning of the 2010/2011 school year;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />All children who meet the distance criteria will continue to be transported to their school of attendance (and this may not be their nearest school) until they complete their schooling at that school;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Transport Services will be retained where there are four eligible children, which is three less than is generally applied;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />In cases where the minimum number of four is not met and these children cannot be facilitated on other services, these children will be eligible for a school transport grant, given that they meet the distance criteria;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Visiting Teachers for Travellers (VTTs) may also identify on an exceptional basis the minimal number of cases where unique school transport arrangements may be required and an application form has been devised for this purpose.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the general school transport scheme on behalf of the Department, will in future manage all school transport arrangements for Traveller children.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is currently assessing the eligibility of the Traveller children identified in terms of the distance criteria and this process will determine the number of children involved.</P>
        <P>The Visiting Teachers for Travellers have been requested to compile evidence on any adverse effects on school attendance in the normal course of their work and will report to the Department&rsquo;s Traveller Implementation Group.</P>
