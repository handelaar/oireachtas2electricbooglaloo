      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I object to the moving of this motion and propose the deletion of all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; and their replacement with:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the proceedings and the motion of nomination of Members or Members of the Government shall be taken immediately after Leaders&rsquo; Questions and shall continue after Private Members&rsquo; business and conclude at 10.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair; and any division demanded thereon shall be taken manually.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy formally moving that amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes.  I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">That all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; be deleted and replaced with the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the proceedings and the motion of nomination of Members or Members of the Government shall be taken immediately after Leaders&rsquo; Questions and shall continue after Private Members&rsquo; business and conclude at 10.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair; and any division demanded thereon shall be taken manually.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Taoiseach and the members of his Government have returned to this House, after an absence of two weeks, at a time when Molesworth Street is filled with people waiting for passports and there is increasing panic in financial circles that more and more liquidations and insolvencies are being recorded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Deputy that we are dealing with a procedural motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has proposed an amendment to a procedural motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I do not agree that this State should fall down on its constitutional responsibility to provide the citizens of this State with passports as they pursue their right to travel, as determined by a High Court case in the 1980s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear that the Government is falling down on its constitutional responsibilities, as well as its political responsibilities to focus on the real needs of the people.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="3"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be ample opportunity to make these points at a later stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>For that reason, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to stick with the procedural motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>People who have got jobs abroad cannot go to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It smacks of the height of arrogance that, after a fortnight&rsquo;s absence from the House, the Taoiseach has come in here to blandly say we will have no Leaders&rsquo; Questions, no questions to the Taoiseach and no Adjournment debate.  He did not say whether there will be any answerability or accountability on the issues that are affecting people all over the country.  For that reason, I strongly oppose the Government motion and propose that we continue with Leaders&rsquo; Questions in the ordinary way.  I believe we should extend the sitting of the D&aacute;il until 10.30 p.m. and have a vote on the proposals the Taoiseach will make.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PJSheenan"><NameTxt>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be no cover-up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I would also like to object to the manner in which the Taoiseach proposes we should deal with the long-heralded reshuffle of the Cabinet, which is to be announced today.  He has proposed that the House should resume at 3.15 p.m. in order that he can make the announcement and the leaders of the parties can make 15-minute statements in the House.  That will account for an hour of the debate.   A further ten minutes will be accounted for when a Government Minister wraps up at the end of the debate.  The remaining hour and 50 minutes will be divided equally between Government and Opposition speakers.  Therefore, Opposition Deputies will have 55 minutes in which to comment on changes in the Government.  We do not yet know what the extent of such changes will be.  The changes may relate purely to personnel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Timmy Dooley might be promoted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation may be required if the structure of Departments is to be changed.  In any event, these changes will require some teasing out by the Members of the House.  I refer to issues like the functioning of Departments, the division of various responsibilities, the appropriateness of linking a particular policy area with another area, the cost of changing Departments and the manner in which such changes might sit with the Government&rsquo;s previous policy on decentralisation.  It will not be possible to address all such issues in the length of time that is proposed.  Under an alternative proposal made by the Labour Party Whip, Deputy Stagg, the business of the House would continue until 9 p.m. &mdash; we do not particularly object to the proposal to start considering these matters now &mdash; and we would have a minimum of six hours for the debate.  In the original business that was notified to us, we were told the vote on the composition of the Cabinet would take place at 7 p.m.  When the media managers got hold of that proposal, the relevant time was changed to 6 p.m. because they felt it might make a nice picture for television to have the newly appointed Ministers driving to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in at 6 p.m. to receive their seals of office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Will they go there by bicycle?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps they will drive up Molesworth Street.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The rights of the elected Members of the House, who represent the people, to comment and to express an opinion on the composition of the Cabinet and the structure of Departments is being sacrificed again for the headline, the picture and the public <Col N="4"/>relations spin.  This is a signal that this is more about public relations than about good government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not just about the rights of voices in this House, it is about the responsibilities of voices in this House.  We have, within a stone&rsquo;s throw of this institution, citizens of the State who are going through a traumatic time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have to remind Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that this is a procedural motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and there will be ample opportunities to make these points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking about procedure, but the Ceann Comhairle did not let me finish my first sentence.  Will he settle back and allow a little bit of fair play?  I am indicating that we have citizens outside this institution who are going through a traumatic time in their lives and for their children.  There is no accommodation of address of these matters in the proposed ordering of business for today.  Whatever about the shuffling of the deck of cards across from us and whatever other changes may be presented, there are real and harrowing issues that must be addressed, issues that have grown in their importance and in their need of substantive address since last we sat in this Chamber.  Yet the Taoiseach is proposing that we ignore all of that, that we have the business only of the so-called Cabinet reshuffle and Private Members&rsquo; business to follow.</P>
        <P>That is simply not good enough, and more is expected from the Members of this House against all of the calamitous situations that are ongoing in the lives of ordinary people.  This is absolutely unacceptable and I re-emphasise that it is our responsibility and that collectively there is a failure in terms of address of these matters in what the Taoiseach is proposing.  Accordingly, the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies will oppose this proposition.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the House that the Presidential Commission, acting on my advice, has accepted the resignation of Deputy Cullen as a member of the Government.  I wish to place on the record of the House my gratitude to Martin Cullen for the contribution he has made to the work of the Government and to public service.  It is a matter of widely-expressed regret that his medical condition is such that he felt unable to continue to serve and I wish to renew my best wishes to him at this difficult time for him and his family.  I also confirm that heretofore I have acknowledged the contribution of the former Minister, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, when bringing notice of his resignation to the House on that occasion.</P>
        <P>I move: &ldquo;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Pat Carey and Deputy Tony Killeen for appointment by the President to be Members of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>In addition, I wish to advise the House that I intend to make the following proposed reassignments.  I propose to assign responsibility for the Department of Education and Science to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Mary Coughlan, the Department of Social and Family Affairs to Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism to Deputy Mary Hanafin, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to Deputy Pat Carey and the Department of Defence to Deputy Tony Killeen.  Subject to the motion that I have put to the House being approved, Deputies Pat Carey and Tony Killeen will cease to be Ministers of State on their appointment as members of the Government.  I propose to nominate to the Government Deputies Cuffe, White and Connick to be Ministers of State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>What does Deputy O&rsquo;Dea think of that?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="8"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will propose to the Government the Departments to which they will be nominated and some other changes in the allocation of responsibilities to existing Ministers of State, including the appointment of Deputy Curran as Chief Whip.</P>
        <P>First, I want to outline the context in which these changes are taking place.  In the past two years, the world has changed radically and we as a country have been changing with it.  For the bulk of this time, my Government&rsquo;s focus has been on stabilising the deterioration in the public finances and banking sector as well as protecting those who have fallen on hard times and continuing to protect and create as many jobs as possible.  By taking some hard decisions and making tough choices, we are now in position to rebuild from a more solid base and focus on the future with confidence.  Although I believe the worst is over, I also believe that as a country we have major challenges and decisions to make, but we are on the right track and I know that, if we remain committed and resolved, we can overcome the obstacles we are facing.</P>
        <P>As our focus shifts to generating economic growth again, so must the Government adapt to the new challenges and sharpen its focus on new tasks.  This requires changes in how Government works.  In approaching the reconfiguration of Departments, the starting point has to be clarity about the objectives to be achieved.  The changes I am making are intended to ensure that political leadership and administrative capacity are aligned with the core objectives of economic recovery, job creation and support for those who have lost their jobs.  In particular, I am strengthening our approach to supporting innovation and overcoming barriers to structural change, responding better to the needs of unemployed people, supporting productivity and growth through skills development, maintaining progress in a coherent and strategic way towards important social policy goals and accelerating the pace of modernisation of the public service.</P>
        <P>I do not believe in making structural changes for their own sake.  Too often, changes in structures can be pursued to disguise a lack of clear priorities or the determination to implement them.  This Government has a clear agenda that I am determined will be driven forward with energy and commitment.  There is no time to be wasted on extensive restructuring at the expense of action to implement our policies.  Restructuring of Departments and agencies inevitably entails disruption and costs, but I am satisfied that, with the changes I am making, the benefits will outweigh the costs because they will group functions the combination of which is more appropriate to current priorities than the present arrangements, ensure greater coherence, produce more efficient delivery and underline the priority issues for this Government in a way that mobilises a broad response.</P>
        <P>A major focus of the changes I am making is the jobs agenda, namely, creating the conditions for sustainable job creation,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Within the framework of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to fiscal stability and the restoration of a functioning banking system, economic recovery will require a renewed focus on supporting enterprise and driving innovation.  The agenda set out in the recent report of the task force on innovation highlights some of what needs to be done, building on the very significant presence of overseas companies and the potential for a much faster rate of growth of our many high-potential indigenous companies.  I propose to sharpen this focus within the <Col N="9"/>Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which will be renamed the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, by transferring to it funding for the programme for research in third level institutions.  This will help to bring together a streamlined and focused programme of funding of research and development aligned with the objectives of enterprise policy.</P>
        <P>Growing the enterprise sector to produce employment opportunities requires that our people are trained and skilled to take advantage of job opportunities.  Responsibility for skills and training policy is being re-allocated to the Department of Education and Science, which will become the Department of Education and Skills.  In addition to the work of the expert skills group, responsibility will transfer for the training activities of F&Aacute;S, which will therefore be aligned more closely with the further education and training activities of the VECs, the institutes of technology and programmes such as Youthreach.</P>
        <P>Providing a more effective and streamlined response to the needs of the unemployed requires more joining up and ultimately integration of the income support provided through the social welfare system with the support for activation and preparation for re-entry to employment.  Accordingly, responsibility for the employment services of F&Aacute;S is being transferred to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which will become the Department of Social Protection.  The community services programmes of F&Aacute;S will also be the responsibility of this Department and I also intend to transfer responsibility for the operation of the rural social scheme to that Department so as that services providing income and direct work opportunities for the unemployed are brought together.  In due course, I envisage that responsibility for the payment of redundancy and insolvency payments will also be transferred to this Department.</P>
        <P>It is important, while addressing the priority issues in responding to unemployment and driving economic recovery, that we do not lose sight of the importance of social development, the targeting of the most vulnerable and support for those working to make a difference right across our communities.  I have therefore decided that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will become the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs and will incorporate responsibility for social inclusion policy and family policy from the Department of Social and Family Affairs and for equality, disability, integration and human rights from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The revised programme for Government sets out the priority objectives to be pursued over the period ahead.  It contains a clear agenda for change and delivery across all Departments, including those that are not affected by the reconfiguration I am announcing today.  All have their role to play.  In this regard, I want to refer specifically to the important role to be played by the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport, not only in the vital area of tourism policy and performance, but in realising the full potential of our strong performance and reputation in the area of arts and culture and ensuring that the creative industries play their full part in the vital task of economic renewal.  The tourism and hospitality industry employs more than 200,000 people and brings in over &euro;6 billion in revenue every year.  We want to grow this business significantly.  In order to secure better synergy with related activities, I am transferring responsibility for the horse and greyhound racing industries to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to public service reform, the Government has set out its vision and strategy for achieving the transformation of the public services.  The pressure on resources, reflected in reduced public service numbers, puts a premium on ensuring that this agenda for change is fully implemented.  The current discussions taking place with the public service unions are based on the fact that there is significant agreement between the Government and the <Col N="10"/>unions about what can and should be done to modernise the public service and to liberate the talent of those who have so much to contribute, especially at this time of challenge.</P>

	<P>Does the Taoiseach believe that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am confident that these discussions will result in a new dynamic for progress and transformation.  Against that background, I have decided to give a strengthened emphasis to the direction and leadership of change in the public service.  I propose to appoint Deputy Calleary to be Minister of State at my own Department and at the Department of Finance, in addition to his responsibility for labour affairs, to strengthen the political leadership of the change process under the direction of the Cabinet committee on public service transformation, which I chair.  To support this work on a public service-wide basis and to bring greater focus and energy to the task of public service transformation, the Government will appoint a public service board, including members from outside the public service with appropriate experience and skills.</P>

	<P>I do not wish to rain on the parade of anyone who has been elevated to the rank of Cabinet Minister or of those who assume new responsibilities as Ministers of State.  However, this is an extraordinary time in our country.  From what we have heard, the Taoiseach misses the point completely.  Before he was appointed Taoiseach, he had an opportunity, in a month long preparation period, to look at the structure of Departments.  He said he wanted to make a real impact on the difficult circumstances Ireland was facing.  Today, he has made a mishmash of Departments half way through the life of a Government.  For instance, F&Aacute;S is to be split among three separate Departments and it is difficult to understand who has responsibility for it.  </P>
        <P>Napoleon said it was more important to have lucky generals than to have good ones.  The Taoiseach could have taken matters a step further and used his luck.  He was presented with two Cabinet vacancies on a plate but he failed to deal with real issues which affect our country.  The people queuing in Molesworth Street as we speak are not interested in the new appointments made to Cabinet or to the rank of Minister of State.  They are interested in the delivery of the service they require, that is, a passport to leave the country.  That is a constitutional right, as is the right to travel, which the Government has failed to deliver.</P>
        <P>The fact that 434,000 people are without jobs is largely due to the failure of the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government to plan for the future.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to this crisis is to fail to remove a single Minister from his or her job, despite the fact that these people drove the economy onto the rocks in the past number of years.  We have a dysfunctional health system where people are afraid to go to the hospitals which are supposed to look after them.  The warning signs went unheeded.  The Minister for Health and Children continues in her position <Col N="12"/>at the top of this system, despite the rigidity of her approach when radical change is needed to shift emphasis, effect and impact in her Department.  We have a line-up of Ministers who have failed in their Departments.  Some have become a by-word for inaction and incompetence.  The Taoiseach has made some changes.  The T&aacute;naiste has been shifted downwards to the new Department of Education and Skills and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has been moved somewhere else.  I am not sure yet.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Minister for Education and Science has moved closer to the Taoiseach.  They are on the Front Bench at present and are all very happy.  They sit there completely oblivious to the real problems which face people throughout the country every day.  People do not have jobs, they cannot pay mortgages and their houses are in negative equity or are being repossessed.  People are lying on hospital trolleys and their sons and daughters are being sucked again into emigration.  </P>
        <P>This is the worst Government in the history of the State and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s motion proposes to keep it virtually intact.  Its main figures have been involved in crashing the Irish economy onto the rocks in recent years.  The Ministers who were confirmed in their jobs today were at the helm when they ignored all warnings given by independent and political commentators about the running of the economy and their failure to correct it.  The same group of Ministers presided over the country&rsquo;s slide into a deep recession in which the numbers of unemployed have increased from 167,000 in 2007 to 432,000 today and where the spectre of forced emigration has become a reality.  A budgetary surplus of &euro;346 million in 2007 has become a projected deficit of &euro;20 billion this year.  A failed bureaucracy runs the health service in which thousands of X-rays and referral letters are left unread and our education system is expected to have the largest class sizes of any OECD member country this year.  This is the legacy of a Government and a Taoiseach who is asking the House to give the same team more time to do more damage.  I disagree with that.</P>
        <P>Outside Leinster House today, a member of the public has set up a placard showing playing cards carrying photographs of members of the Cabinet.  He will not have to change many of those cards.  While the Taoiseach could have done a radical reshuffle, he has merely played a weird version of Happy Families and, in the process, has proved himself to be a busted flush.  This is not a new Cabinet.  People will be talking about a new Cabinet but it is merely more of the same and we are stuck with them.</P>
        <P>Matters are much more serious than a continuation of incompetence.  The new Cabinet proves that the Taoiseach does not get it.  He does not get the idea of consistency.  When, at long last, he was dragged away from admiring the fundamentals of our economy and forced to realise that the banking system had failed, his Minister for Finance did one thing right.  I give credit where it is due.  The Minister for Finance sent a message a foot high to bankers that they must get rid of the guys at the top who caused the problem.  The instruction to get rid of them was stark and clear.  One would think the Taoiseach himself would have learned from the clarity of that message.  One would have thought he would have sent the same message to the Departments which have failed and continue to fail, that the people at the top who are causing the problem must be got rid of.  The Taoiseach did not do that.</P>
        <P>This tells us two interesting things about his leadership and his Taoiseachship.  First, he sticks with the tribalism referred to by his predecessor when he said, &ldquo;Our ethics are get in here and stay in here at all costs&rdquo;.  Any business appointing new managers starts with the task, the job and the requirement and then picks the personnel based on their proven competence to that <Col N="13"/>point or elsewhere.  The Taoiseach did not do that.  He did not look at the job to be done and he certainly did not look at the track record of the people to be appointed.  He took the easiest option, which is the tribal option.</P>
        <P>Those watching this debate on television or hearing about it will know in their hearts and souls that if the Cabinet were a company the CEO, looking at senior management with an eight year track record of consistent failure, would have no alternative but to fire them.  Any CEO looking at a company that had been brought into international disrepute, had moved from wealth to poverty, was surviving only on borrowings and had shed so many of its workforce would know that he owed it to the shareholders to be courageous, not to keep or promote people based on friendship, location or his own unwillingness to act.  He would owe it to the shareholders to cut away the dross and put in new people of proven competence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach did not do that.  It may be that he just could not do it, or has he so little faith in his own backbenchers that he could not see, in all the benches behind him, even half a dozen people with the proven competence, energy and diligence to become Ministers.  He did not even have half a dozen promising people who could do much better than the current tired bunch of fatigued and exhausted failures.  He did not even have five, or four, or three.  I have to sympathise with him in that regard because on this side of the House we have a team ready and willing to take over&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach has managed to transfer unbelievable financial risk from bankers and developers to the taxpayer.  I put him on warning that it is my information that when the first tranche of massive loans move into NAMA, there will be no banks to support them.  There is not the competence, personnel, experience or the assessment quality of the five-year programmes in respect of those companies in NAMA to do that job.  If the Taoiseach does not get this right, he will risk a movement towards the entire collapse of the construction sector.  Nothing will move in NAMA with its incapacity to deal with the volume of loans that will be moved across to it.  </P>
        <P>Somebody pointed out to me that Goldman Sachs, which has a portfolio of approximately &euro;30 billion, has approximately 3,000 people dealing with it.  There are currently 60 or 65 people in NAMA dealing with its potential portfolio of more than &euro;50 billion.  If the Taoiseach does not get this right, he risks serious constriction of the entire construction sector where no decisions can be made, no assessments can be validated and, as a consequence, serious disruption will impact on the economy.  I hope that the Minister for Finance takes on board this point and deals with it.</P>
        <P>At the end of this pathetic game of happy families, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Front Bench is an indictment of his judgment, courage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Even the survivors across the House who will walk back to their offices from here know in their hearts that what the Taoiseach has taken the most <Col N="15"/>minimalistic approach to deal with the real problems facing our country.  It is a rag upon a stick and it is a well used rag at that.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has retreated from the challenge of leadership that fell upon his shoulders.  He could have been courageous, taken a different approach and from among those on his own backbenches he could have reshuffled his Cabinet so that it would bring some semblance of life to an exhausted group who are fatigued and flattened.  They are without ideas, energy, ideals or commitment.  I do not wish to rain on the parade of the Ministers elect &mdash; Deputies Carey and Killeen &mdash; who in fairness have soldiered in the depths of winter for Fianna F&aacute;il on many occasions, and for those promoted to the rank of Minister of State, which is a personal honour for them and their families.   However, this Cabinet&rsquo;s time is doomed.  The Taoiseach should show courage and seek a dissolution of the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>There are only a handful of people in the country who really care about this exercise in spin with which we have been presented this afternoon.  They are the people who have been selected for bigger office and a bigger car.  I congratulate the Ministers elect, Deputies Carey and Killeen, for whom I have personal regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Government does not care about the purpose of governing; it cares only about power.  This exercise is not about the revival of the economy or the revival of the country but the survival of Fianna F&aacute;il in Government for a longer period of time than this country can afford.  The purpose of Government should be to reflect the will of the people, their values, hopes and aspirations and it should be to lead and to navigate this country out of the treacherous waters in which we now find ourselves.  Above all, it should to serve the people to put the national community first before party politics or individual egos.  On all three counts this Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government has failed.  This is a Government without a mandate.  No Government since the foundation of the State has had such low approval ratings.  With almost nine out of ten people indicating they do not support this Government, it no longer reflects the will of the people and certainly does not reflect their values.</P>
        <P>Irish people do not want their future and their children&rsquo;s future mortgaged to NAMA.  They do not want to take on the massive debts of reckless property developers who lived high on the boom and are protected by their Fianna F&aacute;il friends in the bust.  This Government cannot lead.   To lead, one needs to get people to row in behind one.  Instead, this Government has repeatedly sown division, pitched public sector against private sector and targeted children, mothers, the unemployed, the poor, the elderly, the disabled and others who rely on public services for their quality of life.  It has put its own needs and those of the governing parties before the needs of people.</P>
        <P>The Government was re-elected in 2007 on a set of promises, central to which was an assertion, made by the Taoiseach more than most, that only the Fianna F&aacute;il Party could manage the economy.  On 14 May 2007, when the Taoiseach and then Minister for Finance launched his party&rsquo;s economic policy he stated: &ldquo;People know what they vote for when they vote for Fianna F&aacute;il.  They know precisely what they are voting for.&rdquo;  He also indicated that his party&rsquo;s policies were based on &ldquo;responsible budgets&rdquo; and his Government would pass on the country &ldquo;effectively debt free&rdquo; to the next generation.  He pledged &euro;844 million worth of tax cuts annually, including the halving of PRSI.  People voted for these commitments.  Instead of cutting tax, however, the Government cut wages.  Instead of putting money into people&rsquo;s pockets, as the Fianna F&aacute;il Party said it would do, it has taken &euro;11 billion out of taxpayers&rsquo; pockets and used it to shore up the books of the banks and overstretched developers.</P><Col N="17"/>
        <P>The fiction that only Fianna F&aacute;il can manage the economy is betrayed in how fast the economy unravelled on its watch.  Ireland was first to enter recession and we will be the last out of it.  Our recession is deeper and will last longer because Fianna F&aacute;il allowed our economy to be built on sand.  It turned the export-led economy it inherited from the Labour Party Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, into a property bubble.  Instead of attending to the long-term competitiveness of the economy, it gambled on a consumption boom.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party prided itself on reducing the national debt but instead transferred this debt to every Irish household in the form of impossibly high mortgages and repayments for the costs of NAMA.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party turned a blind eye to reckless lending by the banks.  After all, it needed the banks to maintain the boom.  Now that the party is over, it is ordinary people who are left to clean up the mess.  In February 2010, some 436,000 people were on the dole, 85,000 of whom were aged under 25 years.  Some 283,000 people have joined the live register since the 2007 general election and 340 people have lost their jobs every day since the Taoiseach&rsquo;s appointment.  In 2009 alone, an average of four firms went bust every day.  It is predicted that the number of business closures in 2010 will be approximately 2,000.  The <i>Insolvency Journal</i> estimates that five firms went bust every day in February 2010.  Across the economy, in both the public and the private sector, people have taken significant pay cuts.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach states we must regain our lost competitiveness.  Who presided over this loss of competitiveness?  Ireland&rsquo;s economy has been losing competitiveness since 2003 and for much of the intervening period, while the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, he presided over soaring costs of housing and commercial property rents, all of which pushed up costs and made the economy less competitive.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is happy to talk about competitiveness when it means asking a nurse earning &euro;35,000 per year to take an 8% pay cut.  Where was his Government&rsquo;s support for competitiveness two weeks ago when the Labour Party introduced a proposal in the House to address problems in the commercial rental sector by giving some relief to retailers who are facing serious competitiveness problems?  I remind the House that the Government voted down our proposal.  It does not have a plan to create new jobs or improve our competitiveness.  The only action we have seen from it is a miserable policy of driving down wages and quality of life, while waiting to hop on the coat tails of a European recovery.</P>
        <P>The Government will not even agree to have an inquiry into what occurred in the banking sector.  The reason is that such an inquiry would land at the Government&rsquo;s door and expose the Taoiseach&rsquo;s role, as Minister for Finance, in presiding over what occurred in the banking system.  In particular, the Government will not allow us to examine what happened in September 2008 when it provided a blanket guarantee for the banks.</P>
        <P>Since 2007, tax revenue has declined by 34% in nominal terms from &euro;47.25 billion to &euro;31.05 billion.  This demonstrates that it is a lie to suggest the Fianna F&aacute;il Party could satisfactorily manage the economy.</P>
        <P>I could address many areas arising from the proposals before the House.  I was struck, however, by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s words on the centrality of jobs.  He is correct in that regard.  This is what the Labour Party has been saying since before the recession.  If jobs are so central, why has it taken the Taoiseach two years to cop on to that fact?  The Taoiseach did not take the opportunity in the long lead-in we endured while he was celebrating his election as leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and before he became Taoiseach to do the reconfiguration that would have placed an emphasis on jobs.  This is being done belatedly and in a way that adds more confusion to the organisation of Government Departments than it clarifies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the extraordinary aspects of today&rsquo;s announcement is what the Taoiseach did not do.  Why is the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, still in office?  By any standards, she should be removed from office.  While I acknowledge she has been a good Minister in other Departments and has made a major contribution to public life, her record as Minister for Health and Children has been hopeless.</P>
        <P>Since 2007, we have had a series of crises in the health service.  In August 2007 a HIQA investigation resulted in breast cancer services in Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital in Limerick being suspended.  In November of the same year, 97 women had to be re-tested after a review of mammograms in the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise.  In September 2008, an inquiry was announced into Ennis General Hospital.  In November 2008, nine lung cancer patients received delayed diagnoses.  During the Minister&rsquo;s recent absence from the country arising from her visit to New Zealand, we learned that X-rays and letters of referral had not been read in Tallaght hospital.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s solution to bed shortages and other problems in the health system is to build private clinics under some form of public-private partnership arrangement.  Even that policy, misguided as it was, has collapsed in the new economic circumstances.  I propose to give two local examples which show where the Government&rsquo;s health policies are failing.  On Saturday morning last, I received a telephone call from the family of a patient suffering from bowel cancer who had been admitted to a hospital on Thursday last week and was still on a trolley in the accident and emergency department.  When my office contacted the hospital concerned it received this reply:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">I spoke to X in A &amp; E.  She spoke to Y and his family this morning and explained the bed situation.  There are no beds, 3 patients from A &amp; E went to theatre this morning and there are no beds for them either.  She does not expect the situation to change within the next 24/36 hours.  They are doing the best they can.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This is our health system in 2010, after many years under the Minister, Deputy Harney, whom the Taoiseach has chosen to leave in charge of the service.</P>
        <P>I welcome the appointment of my colleague, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe, as Minister of State and wish him well.  My constituency is now teeming with Ministers, of whom there are three.</P>

         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In 2002, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, who was then Minister for Health and Children, entered into a commitment with the National Rehabilitation Hospital that if the hospital sold nine acres of land to an adjoining company, a new national rehabilitation hospital would be built.  Every Member of the House is familiar with this hospital.  It is where people go after car accidents or with acquired brain injury.  Everybody speaks very highly of it.  I stood in that hospital yesterday, in a 19-bed ward of mixed genders that had two open bathrooms at the end of the ward.  It was from the 19th century.  I talked with the people there about the need to build a new hospital.  They went to tender at the end of 2008 and accepted a tender at the beginning of 2009.  They are still waiting.</P>

        <P>My constituency can do without three Ministers although I wish the best of luck to all three.  However, we cannot do without the building of that hospital.  Interestingly, when the Taoiseach reviewed the programme for Government last summer he removed any reference to the hospital. The person who has now been appointed a Minister of State, whose job I would have thought was to keep an eye on these matters, did not appear to notice, make a complaint or insist that the hospital be kept in the programme.</P>
        <P>What we have been offered today is not a fresh start or a change but what may be termed the &ldquo;same old, same old&rdquo;.  I wish the individuals who are being appointed to ministerial office well but this is not what the people are looking for.  Everywhere I go in this country I am asked one question, namely, &ldquo;When are you getting them out?&rdquo;  Unfortunately, we cannot get them out on the Opposition benches.  However, I put this challenge to each of the so-called Independent Members.</P>

	<P>We had to take those tough decisions because in the first place we had to deal with the public finances and the banking crisis.  If one looks objectively at what has been achieved one will see that a great deal of work has been done to make this country a fairer place.  First, we dealt with the tax system and restructured it.  We also had to ensure we got to the tax exiles which is something that has not been done before.  We had to ensure we cut off the tax loopholes.  We had to introduce new taxes which should have been introduced many years ago, including taxes on second homes.  This was never done before and we have done it.  The record will show that.</P>

His health problems are of such a great nature he must take time out and I wish him and his family well in his recovery.  Likewise I wish Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea well.  I say to him that I shall continue my work in dealing with his town, Limerick.  We have done considerable work in my Department and are dealing for the first time with the boundary issue in Limerick and with the regeneration issue there.  These are both very important issues.</P>

He worked to develop horticulture in his own constituency of Dublin North, the sector&rsquo;s powerhouse, and across the country.  He worked on developing the farmers&rsquo; markets which increased in numbers on his watch by an impressive 25%.  Deputy Sargent framed an action plan to deliver an organic target of 5%, as agreed in the programme for Government.  This is on target to be achieved in the lifetime of this Government.  Areas farmed organically increased by 10% in his first year in office.  He also launched a hugely successful scheme to have primary pupils grow vegetables and fruit and he helped secure private sponsorship to keep this scheme alive despite spending cutbacks.  It shows the passion and commitment he brought to that office.</P>

	<P>As they leave the Chamber, I earnestly congratulate Deputies Killeen and Pat Carey on their promotions to full ministerial office.  I also congratulate those who have been brought onto the junior benches.  However, I do not doubt that the real news today is that not one previous office holder has been removed from office.  It is a clear indication that if it had not been for the situations applying in the cases of the former Ministers, Deputies O&rsquo;Dea and Cullen, we would not be looking at any new Ministers today.  We will be asked to vote for a sham, in effect, when the Taoiseach asks us to endorse this partially reshuffled Cabinet.  There should be no mistake about our answer &mdash; we will not endorse this charade of a Government.  Rather than engaging in this partial reshuffle, the <Col N="23"/>members of the Government should be shuffling out of office with their heads held down in shame.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s focus is on retaining jobs for the boys and girls in Fianna F&aacute;il, and the boys and girl in the Green Party.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over 432,000 unemployed citizens of this State are watching this game of musical chairs.  Further thousands of people are looking on from overseas, having been forced to emigrate by this Government&rsquo;s policies.  One in four young people in Ireland is unemployed.  Unemployment among young people in the Twenty-six Counties increased by 150% in 2009, to 85,000 at the start of 2010.  Nationally, the toll continues to rise towards 500,000.  If the figures for those who have emigrated as a result of the recession were taken into account, the figure of 500,000 would be exceeded.  What have unemployed young people got in response to their plight from a Government that seeks our endorsement for these measures?  Without putting a tooth in it, they have got a two-fingered gesture from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  That is the salute they got from the coalition Government when it cut dole payments for the young in budget 2010.  The Taoiseach should ask young people whether they care about whose faces sit around the Cabinet table, about who was elevated or about who was disappointed because they were not shuffled upwards.</P>
        <P>I would have no hesitation in welcoming this Cabinet reshuffle if it were accompanied by fundamental changes in Government policies, but there is no such change.  Having listened to and reread the Taoiseach&rsquo;s contribution to this afternoon&rsquo;s debate, it is clear that there is no such change.  The reshuffled Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Cabinet is on the same course to disaster that it has steered since it came together in June 2007.</P>
        <P>It is clear that there will be no change in health policy.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, is prolonging her tenure as Minister for Health and Children, in which she has made an inequitable health service even more inequitable, for example by promoting for-profit privatisation and ruthless centralisation.  We know too well the results of the disastrous health policies that have been pursued by Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments since 1997.  As I said during the debate on the matter in this House before the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day recess, the debacle in Tallaght hospital was not simply the result of a glitch in a single hospital.  It was a clear example, albeit apparently an extreme one, of the systemic failures that are evident in our health service each day.  At the root of such failures is the two-tier, public-private, apartheid nature of the health system.  That inequity breeds inefficiency and leads to waste, which is compounded by under-resourcing.  In addition, the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government imposed cuts in the 2009 and 2010 budgets that affect public patients worst of all.</P>
        <P>The Tallaght hospital debacle perfectly illustrates the Pontius Pilate attitude of this Government.  The Minister for Health and Children was told about the unread X-rays last December but apparently did not trouble herself to ask how many X-rays were involved, or to keep on top of the situation to ensure it was being addressed.  This is her first appearance in the House since this crisis exploded in our faces and visited such worry on thousands of families across the country.  An inquiry has been established only because a whistle-blower went to the media and exposed the whole affair to public view.  If that had not happened, how long would it have taken the affected patients to be informed?  They  would not have wanted to have depended on the Minister to advise them.  Why did the Minister not make the situation public in the first instance, to ensure openness, transparency and accountability?  That is the question the Minister, Deputy Harney, must answer.</P>
        <P>This reshuffle signals no change in the policy of imposing savage cuts on public services.  This policy is futile in its claimed intent to aid economic recovery and punitive in its effects on the people.  Before I give an example in the education sector, where the T&aacute;naiste has a new role, I would like to express my disagreement with the remark made earlier to the effect that edu<Col N="24"/>cation is a lesser portfolio.  Responsibility for education is a hugely important matter.  I wish to refer to a letter I received last week from a school in my constituency where a special class has been suppressed, two teaching posts have been cut and children with a multiplicity of special needs have been put back into the mainstream classes from which they were removed on foot of an assessment by a psychologist from the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>This reshuffle will preserve the fundamentally flawed economic approach of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.  Its slash and burn policy will not lead to recovery but to deeper recession.  Just as this policy penalises citizens today, NAMA will penalise them in the future.  The golden circle of politicians, bankers, property speculators and the corporate elite, who profited most from the Celtic tiger and caused the recession, are protecting themselves at a cost of billions of euro to future generations of Irish people.</P>
        <P>The cuts in public services and public service pay made by Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party have led to chaos in public administration in this State.  This is the result of the Government&rsquo;s slash and burn strategy and its deliberate scuppering of the negotiations with the public service unions last December.  Regardless of what may be said about the tactics of some public service unions &mdash; the situation at the passport office is uppermost in people&rsquo;s minds today, as it should be &mdash; the truth is that those ultimately responsible are sitting on the Government benches, or at least some of them were earlier.  Those who must assume some of that responsibility include certain Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers who staged what can only be described as a sham revolt last December as part of the strategy that led to the collapse of those talks.  Where was the backbench revolt when the Government made across the board cuts to social welfare payments?  Where were the resignations from the Green Party then?  In contrast, Sinn F&eacute;in has highlighted the heartlessness of a Government that took &euro;8.50 a week out of the pockets of people who care for elderly and disabled relatives in their homes.  We have opposed the plans of a Government that wants to damage our health services fatally by taking a further 1,100 acute hospital beds out of the system in 2010.  We have stood against a Government that trumpets its commitment to education but condemns children to learn in prefabricated accommodations and takes support away from those with special needs.  This Government has left behind it a trail of destruction of Irish jobs, including those in flagship Irish industry.  It has allowed valuable employment to die and skills to be squandered in SR Technics, Aer Lingus, Waterford Glass, the sugar industry and myriad small and medium-sized enterprises the length and breadth of the country.  As I have said on several occasions in this Chamber, the lights are going out for the last time almost every evening on once thriving businesses.  For Sale and To Let signs on retail and services businesses throughout the State are only accruing dust because there is no access to credit for people with a little gumption, thought and interest to take up the challenge of moving into business.  The NAMA intervention has had no impact in this regard.  The Government has no strategy to keep young people in Ireland and to use their skills to rebuild the economy.  It hopes emigration will hide the true extent of unemployment.  The Government&rsquo;s decision to cut youth dole payments was made in order to encourage young people to leave.</P>
        <P>I could use all my time condemning the policies of this so-called reshuffled Cabinet, and they richly deserve such condemnation.  However, it is just as important to say that there are real alternatives and another way forward.  There are many measures the Government could implement to tackle youth unemployment.  Given that the Taoiseach spoke in his contribution about tackling the terrible scourge that is encroaching on the lives of families the length and breadth of the State, I propose to outline some of the measures my party has proposed in the hope that those now given responsibility will listen, learn and implement.  Sinn F&eacute;in presented its solutions last week and we are determined to campaign for their implementation.  The young <Col N="25"/>unemployed must be given the opportunity to work and to use their skills and education.  Investing in tackling youth unemployment now will pay dividends well into the future.  Sinn F&eacute;in advocates taking revenue from the National Pensions Reserve Fund on a once-off basis and implementing the revenue-raising proposals set out in our budget 2010 pre-budget submission in order to fund our job creation proposals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our proposals include a youth jobs fund to create 20,000 new jobs at a cost of &euro;500 million; an individual plan for the long-term prospects of every person under 25 years who is on the live register; 2,000 places on a &ldquo;one more language&rdquo; scheme to give the young unemployed a chance to learn an extra foreign language, at a cost of &euro;20 million; 5,000 free ECDL advanced places at a cost of &euro;25 million; 10,000 new community employment places at a cost of &euro;168 million; 1,000 places on conversion courses at third level to help graduates convert their skills to potential growth sectors, at a cost of &euro;15 million; eight measures to treble the number of under 25s who are self-employed, including a national entrepreneurship programme, access to credit and greater support for high-potential start-ups; the creation of a publicly owned green technology firm and a major drive to attract foreign direct investment in renewable energy, at a cost of &euro;100 million; making Ireland a digital media leader through support for skills, infrastructure and entrepreneurship; a national development scheme to employ people directly on public works projects employing 2,000 workers at a cost of approximately &euro;100 million; and a lifting of the suspension on the early farm retirement scheme in order to make farming an option for younger people.</P>
        <P>It is possible to beat youth unemployment with imaginative thinking and a political commitment.  However, that has been completely absent from the Government&rsquo;s approach to the jobs crisis.  We are most assuredly not going to get such an approach from what we have heard and witnessed today in terms of this so-called reshuffle.  At the end of the day, it is nothing more than the same clapped-out Administration.  This sham reshuffle comes at a time when there is intense debate on the future of Ireland, with much of that debate being partitionist in nature.  Commentators speak of &ldquo;renewing the republic&rdquo; or &ldquo;re-imagining Ireland&rdquo; but it is an Ireland, in their minds, that stops at Dundalk or Monaghan or Letterkenny and a republic that encompasses only 26 counties.  Republicans have a vital and unique contribution to make to the debate by pointing out that for real transformation in Irish politics, the economy and society, national reunification is essential.  We reimagine Ireland as it ought to be, an island republic with a place for all who live here, a democracy based on human rights and citizenship, an economy based on shared wealth.  For that vision to become a reality,  we need a complete political clear-out in this State.  Neither of the two conservative parties &mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael &mdash; can provide the new politics that we need.  This rehashed Cabinet certainly cannot provide it.  The first step can be taken quickly, which is to allow the people to make a decision on who should occupy these posts of responsibility.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the course of the past 18 months, the Government has had to lead Ireland through an unprecedented period in our history.  It has been no easy task.  Everyone in this House knows that the Government has had to contend with the most severe downturn in the nation&rsquo;s recent economic history.  The roots and causes of this financial crisis, both domestic and external, have been well documented in this Chamber.  We are all conscious that as a result of the most severe global economic circumstances since the 1930s, Ireland, as a small open economy, has been particularly badly affected, losing more than 10% of our national income in two years.</P>
        <P>As a Government, we have had to take extremely difficult decisions.  Those decisions are necessary to deal effectively with the challenges facing Ireland and put our economy back on <Col N="26"/>a track of sustainable growth.  Our approach in tackling the issue has been multi-layered.  The Government, under the leadership of the Taoiseach, has done trojan work in helping to stabilise our public finances and making headway in dealing with the crisis in our banks.  That has taken energy, leadership and a willingness to put the necessary tough choices above the fascination that the parties opposite have with opinion polls.</P>
        <P>As a result of the difficult choices the Government has made, Ireland is on the right path to recovery, but we still have a journey to go and there are difficult steps ahead.  We must build on the progress that has been made and not become complacent.  The changes the Taoiseach has announced today are about bringing fresh impetus to tackling the huge challenges we face as well as ensuring that every available apparatus of government is working efficiently towards getting Ireland back to prosperity.  In framing our plan to see us through this period, we have been conscious of the many positives going for us in this State.  These include our low debt to GDP ratio going into this period, which was critical; our pro-business and pro-employment tax regime; our business regulation that recognises the need for control and certainty without overburdening enterprise; and our continuing commitment to investment in infrastructure, education and, critically, research and development.</P>
        <P>Above all the other positives we have, however, stand our people and, in particular, our young, highly educated workforce.  Ireland has one of the youngest workforces in Europe, with 36% under 25 years of age.  Among OECD countries, Ireland&rsquo;s 25 to 34 year olds have an above average level of educational qualification, with 40% of this group having third level education.  Six out of every ten students in Ireland graduate with a degree in engineering, science or business, and a significant number are proficient in more than one language.  This will confer economic advantages on Ireland in the decades ahead.  Our young people are key to our future economic success.  Equipping them with the skills necessary for the Irish economy of tomorrow is a pivotal element in developing Ireland as the innovation island.</P>
        <P>Our commitment to education, training and skills as the engine of that progression is firm.  Now is the time to take a further step-up in our provision of education and training, ensuring that it is world class in its outcomes.  We must move away from the traditional approach of teacher-led instruction and the memorising of information towards a greater emphasis on critical thinking.  We need to ensure that our students acquire the key skill sets that enable them to be flexible and independent learners throughout their lives.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the prioritisation of education and training at all levels to the greatest extent possible.  The House is well aware of the funding and resources I have put in place in the past 22 months for training and activation.  The close aligning of that training and activation work with the further education and training activities of the VECs, the institutes of technology and programmes such as Youthreach provides an opportunity for the streamlining and strengthening of education and training provision.  I look forward to the challenge ahead in this area.</P>
        <P>For me and for this Government, the changes the Taoiseach has announced today are not about politics as usual.  They are about our children&rsquo;s future.  This is about generating the right environment for education, for enterprise and for employment to flourish, so we can renew prosperity.  There is not a day to lose and every decision has to be weighed up with this imperative in mind.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I would first like to congratulate those who have been promoted.  In particular, I would like to single out Deputy Pat Carey, a colleague of mine on the north side of Dublin, whom I know will bring great energy to his new tasks.</P>
        <P>Pouring old rhetoric into new skins will only produce hot air, and that is what we have heard from many Government spokespersons today.  There have been many high flowing words and phrases like innovation, activation, knowledge economy, young people being the key to our success and so on.  However, this will not make it happen, which is the tragedy of this Government.  I recognise the Taoiseach is bringing in some green hedging to trim around his garden with these extra Ministers of State, but that will not conceal the rotting plantation that is inside.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste has just said that our young people are the key to the future.  In the past two years, 80% of those who have lost their jobs have been under the age of 30.  These are the people in whose future we should be investing.  We should be looking to create the infrastructures that give them a future, such as a decent electricity system, a decent broadband system and a genuine knowledge economy.  However, during this Government&rsquo;s tenure, export shares have collapsed because it pumped up the property bubble.  Our competitiveness has collapsed by 35%.  The National Competitiveness Council has stated that all policy in ICT is in the red zone, 75% of the competitiveness indicators are either amber or red and 80% of the indicators for the knowledge economy are in the red zone.  We slump and fail in science and maths, but we have no policies to correct that.  The Taoiseach thinks that adding &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; or &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; to the name of a Department will change things, but it will not.</P>
        <P>The Government has had stewardship of all these activities, but it has allowed them to decay.  That is not a comfortable truth, but it is the truth all the same.  It went to the electorate in 2007 looking for a mandate to continue the dream.  The Taoiseach, then as Minister for Finance, stated that the property bubble was built on sound economic fundamentals.  He said that the property bubble could go on and that the Government could build spending commitments on the back of it, which he did.  Even after the crisis hit us&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael wanted to abolish stamp duty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the Government continued to spend.  I remember the Taoiseach saying that the Government was adopting an inspired strategy, because it could expand spending as the recession hit.  He increased spending in the following budget at three or four times the prospective growth in the economy that never materialised.  He and his Government built up many of the problems that we now confront.</P>
        <P>Many people are now quoting Rahm Emmanuel, who said that a time of crisis provides an opportunity to do great things.  This is true, but unfortunately the Taoiseach and his Ministers simply cannot deliver.  Their authority is shot through because they went to the country on the pretence that they were competent in managing the economy.  They were not competent in managing competitiveness or regulation, and this has destroyed so many jobs and the lives of so many families and people in debt.  Failed regulation destroyed our country.</P>
        <P>Public finances were mismanaged and the Government ignored warnings.  People who issued warnings were told to commit suicide.  That is what the Government has bequeathed and its members are prisoners of a failed past.  That is why we need a general election.  Let us put their belief that they can transform this economy to the test with the people.  Let us have a Government, whatever its shade or shape, that at least has the authority to confront the problems we <Col N="28"/>face.  These problems are deep and really difficult to address, but they will not be addressed by trying to nurse along the failed loans of the past and starving new businesses of credit.  That is the Government&rsquo;s current banking policy.  Its public finance policy is about slashing investment.  It has taken out &euro;8 billion from its investment programme.  How can we build an infrastructure with decent electricity networks and decent broadband systems on the back of slashing investment?  It has slammed down the shutters on young people getting into the public service, but it has consistently refused to reform the big political bureaucracy that it has created.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s public service reform has produced what could well be described as a three humped camel: the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment all hope to resolve public service reform.  I hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, acting as the mahout for this camel, can deliver some change, but I have little confidence in this because the Taoiseach stated two years ago that public service reform was his priority.  We are now half way through this Administration, but public service reform has languished.  Not only did the Government destroy it with its past decisions on benchmarking, decentralisation and the creation of a HSE without stripping out the management structures, but it is now destroying it again.  The Taoiseach brought people in last Christmas and was going to sign a contract that contained no reform, but a few changes that were to be delivered.  He tried to pretend that this would cut the cost of running the public service on the back of a ten day holiday that would be postponed.  He was willing to sign up to this, but it was only his Minister for Finance who pointed out that this would not deliver the savings we need.  He has not led us to a public service reform agenda, and the new negotiations are timid attempts at reform.</P>
        <P>I welcome 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. working days and other kinds of flexibility, and I welcome a movement of staff, but if we are to reform the public service, we must do much more radical things than that.  We must devolve power and make people accountable.  We must see people sacked for failing, but we never see these things.  The Government has not created that sort of devolved accountability.  When things go wrong, nobody is ever called to account.  That is a failure of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own leadership to change and drive reform.  I would like to see an office of public service reform doing significant things.  For example, there is huge potential to cut out routine processes that are scattered across umpteen different Departments and agencies, and consolidate them in shared service centres where one could get genuine economies of scale.  I would like to see such an agenda on the table now for discussion at these renewed talks.  Let us discuss genuinely how we are going to change the face of the public service, so that good people will not be trapped in a system that fails them because performance is not encouraged, rewarded or prized.  More than any before it, this Government has shown that performance is not worth prizing, given the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attitude to benchmarking and decentralisation.  The Taoiseach finds it extremely difficult to provide leadership because of his past, but at least he should be putting such matters on the agenda.  We should have a radical reform programme that can deliver the savings he is talking about.</P>
        <P>We thought we would see that last year when McCarthy was put to work to produce &euro;5 billion in cuts.  In addition, huge restructuring was proposed.  I would have gone further with some of it, but some people had quibbles with it.  It was published in the paper of record that each Department had to come up with those cuts or their equivalent, but nothing happened.  There was no public service reform and no restructuring.  The clock was ticking towards the 11th hour and the Government cut public service pay.  It was a command and control approach, rather than one of reform.</P>
        <P>The same is true of the Government&rsquo;s pretences towards an employment strategy.  Only last year, it published the Smart Economy document but where was the achievement in that?  Where <Col N="29"/>were the deadlines and milestones whereby one could look back over 15 months later to see what had been delivered and what changes had been made?  No one drove that.  Instead, after about nine or ten months, another committee was established to review it and come up with another strategy.  The new strategy will probably suffer the same fate, languishing while we wait for something to happen.  If the Government says the knowledge economy is the direction to take, then people must be made responsible for it.  Timelines must be published so that we can see if they are being met.  Then the Government will be responsible for change in some of these areas, but it has always slunk away from making hard commitments.  It persists with an approach to budgeting which is absolutely Dickensian.  It is ridiculous to pretend that we can spend &euro;55 million without asking any Minister to commit to any target before we commit the money.  I would begin to recognise that change was occurring if I could see some of those elements being altered under the Taoiseach&rsquo;s watch.</P>

	<P>It is a privilege to stand here today and be nominated by the Taoiseach to serve in his Government.  It will be the eighth time that I have been asked to serve in a Government since 1997.  It is a privilege that I do not take lightly.  It is one that I take seriously and I apply all my energy to the task in hand.  I will deal in a moment with some of the issues that have been mentioned concerning health.  First, however, at the time of the last general election in 2007, both the Fine Gael and Labour parties, like the Government parties, based their economic policies on the fact that Ireland would grow by between 4.5% and 5% during the upcoming period.  There was no difference between either side on that matter.  So it is wrong for Deputy Kenny to say that independent economic advice was not listened to.  The fact is that the main parties in this House based their election manifestoes on a growth rate of that order.</P>
        <P>In everything it is doing today, and has done over the past two years, the Government is seeking to return this country to economic growth.  In many places both here and abroad, the Government is being saluted for the difficult and courageous decisions we are taking.  We have stabilised the public finances and have substantially reduced the gap between our revenue base and spending, which has not been easy.  We are seeking to fix the banks and make them fit for purpose so that they can begin lending again and provide working capital to business.  None of this could or would be done by simply taking a populist approach, as is being suggested.</P><Col N="30"/>
        <P>In the run up to the budget, both Opposition parties said they broadly agreed with the &euro;4 billion of adjustments, but they opposed every single adjustment that was made.  The current recession is very different from what we experienced 20 years ago.  Today we have nearly 1 million more people at work.  We are more innovative and better educated, while our industrial base is much more diversified.  Twenty years ago, almost 30% of the economy was dependent on agriculture.  Our markets are also more diversified now and we are less dependent on our neighbouring market in the UK.  Geography is no longer the determinant of where Irish companies trade.  Therefore, it is blatantly wrong for anyone to suggest that the situation we are in today &mdash; difficult and challenging as it is for all of us &mdash; is unprecedented.  The hard task for Government is not to be deflected; it is to persist and bring clarity.  In particular, the change in Departments and the machinery of Government, while not important in itself, has to happen in order to meet our strategic goals.  Clearly they must change given the economic circumstances the country is confronting.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has been referred to as cautious and I would say that is his character.  He is not a soundbite person, although we hear a lot of soundbites from others.  He is a person of substance.  There are things that people might do if they wanted to be popular and take a short-term view.  However, there are other, more difficult things that people do when they want to put the country first.  History is always a good judge of people who put the country first, particularly in difficult economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>I am happy to defend my record and that of the Government on health.  The policies I pursue are not my personal ones, rather are the policies endorsed by the Government.  Our health system has improved enormously in recent years.  Twenty years ago, the then Minister for Health, Barry Desmond, spoke about the shroud passing over the Opposition.  His successors today in the Labour Party seem to be suffering from the same illusion.  The cancer control plan, which was all about delivering better, safer cancer services for patients, was opposed by both Opposition parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>

	<P>Deputy Kenny is a man who aspires to be Taoiseach, leading the Government and the country.  In his speech he referred to the need for courage and clarity, so I am entitled to make these points.  The Labour Party said the cancer control plan could not be implemented because we did not have millions of euro to invest in it.  Professor Tom Keane showed that by redirecting resources, not by additionality to any great extent, one can deliver change.  </P>
        <P>In 2007, this House introduced legislation to provide for something as simple as a lay majority in charge of the medical profession, but that too was opposed by the Opposition.  Even the <Col N="31"/>doctors, who were worried about a lay majority, have told me in recent times that it was one of the best decisions made because of the quality of the lay majority on the Medical Council.</P>
        <P>The Fair Deal providing equity of care for older people, whether in private residential care or public nursing homes, was equally opposed.  I could go on forever about this, but the reality is that we will not change the health service unless we make difficult and unpopular decisions.  Is somebody trying to suggest that 20 years ago in Ireland there were no misdiagnoses, no unread X-rays and no unopened letters?  Even in the best health systems in the world, radiological errors amount to about 2%, as Deputy Reilly will acknowledge.  The fact is that we are discovering these things today and we are doing something about it.  That is the difference between the situation in which we find ourselves today and where we were a number of years ago.</P>

	<P>It is not about the past; it is about the future.  It is about having an agenda.  The words &ldquo;reform&rdquo; and &ldquo;change&rdquo; have been debased in this House.  It is about improving services for patients bit by bit, day by day.  What is the agenda now?  It is to provide a risk equalisation scheme, for example, that encompasses solidarity between younger and older people and sicker and healthier people.  To be fair, the Labour Party has been supportive of that.  It is about defining in law what people are entitled to and eligible for in our health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about maintaining the two-tier system.  That is the problem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about licensing and accrediting health facilities, which we have never done in this country but for which legislation is currently being prepared.  It is about providing an information regime to allow information to be used to improve services to patients.  This is the agenda for the next two years as far as health is concerned.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue raised by Deputy Gilmore, we do need a new rehabilitation hospital, but there is now a strong view that not all rehabilitation should happen in the capital and that there should be a decentralised approach.  It would not make sense for me, on behalf of taxpayers, to invest resources in a strategy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The problem with the Opposition is that it has a magic-wand approach to health.  Fine Gael favours compulsory private health insurance.  It talks about it as fair care.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>However, it has not been sufficiently fair with the public to tell them how much it would cost.  Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s policy document says that the Netherlands spends <Col N="32"/>more than Ireland on health.  Yet in his speech to the Fine Gael national conference last week he said the reverse.  Which is it?  If we want to have fair care, as the Deputy calls it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What I said was that health care in the Netherlands costs less per capita than in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;let us find out the cost of that policy.  The Labour Party favours compulsory social insurance.  However, there is no magic wand in health.  The issue is not about how to raise the money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>

	<P>The Deputy will have his opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue is about how to allocate the resources, however they are raised &mdash; whether through taxation or compulsory insurance or a combination of both.  Contrary to the view of the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a two-tier system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the best health systems in the world do not favour a fee-per-item approach, which is seen as out-of-date and too costly, with too much emphasis on unnecessary diagnostics.  That is a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is maintaining a two-tier system which is unfair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have suggested to the Joint Committee on Health and Children that it might consider the operation of Kaiser Permanente or the Veterans Health Administration in the United States.  Other health care systems are also moving away from that model.  I say this with sincerity.</P>
        <P>We have established a group, led by Professor Ruane and with many experts from Ireland and overseas, which will report next month on the most appropriate way of allocating resources in health.  We should have a genuine debate on this issue and stop pretending there is an infinite pot of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody is pretending that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and no matter what patient turns up or where, the money will be always there to look after the patient.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody is pretending that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Lastly, I will speak about the issue of a two-tier system.  We have negotiated a new contract with consultants, which took four years.  I was criticised about the length of time it took, but the reason was that we needed to obtain more access for public patients to our consultant manpower.  That is at the heart of the new contract.  There is a one-for-all list for diagnostics and for outpatients based on medical need.  We could not consider the new contract as a blank slate; we had to negotiate within the parameters of the existing contract.  The new contract was welcomed by both parties in Opposition and is now taking root. <Col N="33"/> That, I inform Deputy Rabbitte, is the only way we will end what he broadly calls the two-tier system.  Everybody has universal access to hospitals in this country; the issue is whether they can obtain access based on medical need, unlike some on private health insurance and others.  It is only by changing the contract that we can achieve this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is well over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We talk about saving money.  I spent last summer arguing with Deputy Reilly about taking on costs in the pharmacy sector, which will save us &euro;250 million this year.  This Deputy, who is the leader of the Opposition as far as health is concerned, opposed me all the way as I tried to obtain better value for taxpayers&rsquo; money.  There is no point in pretending&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I pointed out that the Minister could have saved more money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with my colleague Deputy Varadkar.  We will debunk some of the rewriting of history that the Minister has just done before the House.</P>
        <P>First I must comment on the Taoiseach himself &mdash; through the Chair, of course.  He is not leading but rather loitering with intent.  His intent is to continue on as he has done for the past two and a half years, presiding over a worsening economic mess, a health service that is in meltdown, and an education system that is taking special needs assistants away from children, thus preventing them from exploiting their full potential, and increasing class sizes.  I will not go into the other ministries.  I see before me a person who will now be in charge of education but who does not know the difference between Darwin and Einstein, and I wonder where we are going.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s name begins with &ldquo;C&rdquo;, and there are three words beginning with &ldquo;C&rdquo; which could describe today&rsquo;s reshuffle.  I leave it to Members to decide: is what the Taoiseach has done courageous, cautious or cowardly?  Where is the public service reform?  Nowhere.  Bankers screw up, regulators fall asleep at the wheel, public servants preside over large amounts of waste &mdash; as in F&Aacute;S and elsewhere &mdash; and they all get a big golden handshake to go on with, while the taxpayer pays the bill.  That is the idea of public service reform here.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Minister in whom the Taoiseach has so much faith that he has re-appointed her in the same position.  I met the family of Daniel McAnaspie outside the House; I do not know whether the Minister met them.  This is a young man who was in HSE care and who has been missing for four weeks.  The Garda believes, I am told by his family, that he may have come to some serious harm, but nobody in the HSE has gone to the trouble of looking for him or checking areas in which his body might be found &mdash; although I hope it has not gone that far.  He is among many who have gone missing and died in HSE care.  There are other issues with child care, including the lack of proper in-patient facilities for those with psychiatric problems.  We do not even have an inspectorate for adults or children with disabilities who are in care.</P>
        <P>The Minister talked about her reforms and mentioned cancer services.  However, after two years of much talk about reform of cancer services, what she has achieved is an improvement in only one area &mdash; that of breast cancer services.  Even so, there is no service north of a line <Col N="34"/>between Galway and Dublin, although there are several such locations in Dublin.  The wonderful reform does not bear up to examination.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Letterkenny is north of that line.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>In addition, it has come to my notice from several surgeons that patients known to have cancer of the bowel, oesophagus or lung are being pushed down the list to accommodate people who might have breast cancer.  Such is the political drive for reform in this area and to ensure the statistics stack up.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the Minister&rsquo;s great reforms.  One of these was supposed to be co-located hospitals, but there is no sign of a block laid or a sod turned.  What about the new psychiatric unit at St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital, in which the proposal for a new co-located hospital has impinged on the existing unit?  Mental health has been put to the back of the queue again.  In St. Ita&rsquo;s hospital, 23 women and 23 men are in two separate wards in beds two to three feet apart, with one block of three toilets, a shower and a bathroom.  That is what they have to endure under the Minister&rsquo;s reforms.  Is she happy about this?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister happy with the 70% increase in delayed discharges among people who are lying in hospital beds but receiving no service, sometimes ending up in long-term care?  Is she happy with the fact that a maximum of 500 people and an average of 300 people were on trolleys in hospitals this January?  Is she happy with the 20,000 cancelled operations last year?  Behind each of those cancelled operations was a patient who was suffering and in pain.  That is not shroud-waving; it is reality.  People are experiencing real pain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has one minute left.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry I have only one minute left because there is so much more about which to talk, including the hospitals in Portlaoise, Limerick, Galway, the north east and Tallaght.  There is a common thread with regard to the problems that occurred in the north east, Portlaoise and Tallaght: the system knew there were problems but would not act until it was good and ready.  In December, when the Minister found out what had happened at Tallaght hospital, why did she not put together a working group with representatives of the Department of Health and Children, HIQA, the HSE and Tallaght hospital?  Why did she not make sure the hospital had the resources to e-mail those X-rays out around Ireland and the UK if necessary in order that they could be dealt with?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows that technically that cannot happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Where was the Minister when all this went on?  This is the key point, lest those across the House miss it.  There are times in life, even as a doctor, when one cannot do much, but one shows concern and tries to be there for the patient.  There are times, when people are in difficulties, that their relatives and friends turn up and show concern even if they cannot do much about it.  The Minister showed her concern by staying on the far side of the world on her terribly important 16-day trip.</P>
        <P>I ask the Taoiseach to stop taking decisions that are only tough for the poor, the vulnerable and the sick.  He should take a decision that is tough on himself &mdash; to go to the country and get a mandate from the people, because he still does not have one.</P>

	<P>This country does not need a new Cabinet but it needs a new Government with a five-year term, a clear and safe majority and a mandate to govern.  The Minister for Health and Children is right in that no party put forward a manifesto at the last election reflecting our current position.  Neither the Government nor the Opposition has a mandate to do what needs to be done.  The Minister gave a very good reason for a new election and Government with a real mandate.  A new Government will allow for renewal, give people the catharsis they need and allow for a fresh start.  That is why we need a new Government rather than a new Cabinet.</P>
        <P>It has been said that on Planet Bertie there were jobs for the boys but it is clear that on Planet Gormley, there are jobs for the Greens.  The Green Party campaigned in 2007 by saying that Green politics are clean politics but it is clear that Green politics equate to crony politics.  Five of the six Green Party Deputies have held ministerial office and when one of the Senators did not get a job in Europe, she went off in a huff.  Several of the party&rsquo;s defeated candidates have been appointed to State boards without any scrutiny whatever and it seems the only person who is not fit for ministerial office is Deputy Paul Gogarty.  We do not know the reason for that.</P>

	<P>The restructuring of the Cabinet is a botched job.  It is the worst reshuffle since Garrett FitzGerald&rsquo;s botched reshuffle of 1986.  F&Aacute;S, which is the most troubled agency in this country and needs a Minister to fix it, is divided among three Departments &mdash; the Department responsible for social protection, the Department responsible for education and skills and the Department responsible for enterprise, trade and innovation.  There will be no oversight and we know each of the Ministers will pass the buck to each other.  There will be a corporate governance nightmare.  If the Taoiseach is not going to break up the agency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should consider the Labour Services Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>That Act does not cover it.  If the agency is not broken up, there will be a problem.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement today is contradictory to the Labour Services Act in that case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>

	<P>It would seem the labour portfolio will remain in enterprise, trade and innovation, although this was not mentioned in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement.  Employment has been downgraded and there is to be no Department with employment, jobs or labour in the title.</P>

	<P>This is slapstick stuff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the most important issue facing the country and there is a Minister for everything else but not employment.  It is an extraordinary decision.  The employment functions should have been taken from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment &mdash; dealing with the people who are on benefits and of a working age &mdash; and put in a new Department of employment, work and skills, or work and benefits.  The Taoiseach should have done as they did in the UK.</P>
        <P>The issue of the public sector is another botched job.  Deputy Dara Calleary will be Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, which will be a big job considering the state the country is in.  He will have to co-ordinate across two other Department &mdash; a total of three Departments &mdash; to deal with public sector reform.  There will also be a Cabinet committee and a public sector board and quango.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be no quango.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach does not even understand what public sector reform is about if he thinks that sort of nonsensical triangular arrangement will be successful.</P>
        <P>There is another strange Department that will be responsible for community, equality and the Gaeltacht.  It will also be responsible for disabilities and the integration of immigrants.  It should be called what it is, which is a Department of the miscellaneous.  Anything that could not be housed elsewhere has been shoved into this one and there will be a Minister for the miscellaneous.</P>

	<P>It is these aspects which are important to Irish citizens.  When one asks people what they know about Ireland, they do not refer to the banks or the recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>They refer to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s recent visit to Paris.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>They refer instead to who we are, what we are and that for which we stand.  This reflects the importance of my new portfolio in a governmental context.  I look forward to continuing to ensure that our culture, which is central to us as a people, continues to be celebrated, promoted and developed.  As has been stated previously, our culture is the rose on the table and it is extremely important to Irish families.</P>
        <P>The same can be said of sport.  A great deal of emphasis is placed on sport in this country.  Perhaps we should spend more time ensuring that our children are fit and healthy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or focusing on women in sport and what they have achieved.  Now that people are living longer, we want them to lead healthy lives and to participate.  I recognise the sporting successes that have been achieved at national, county and club level.  Regardless of whether one is referring to national sports such as hurling or minority sports such as sailing, there is no doubt that there is major potential for people to participate.  Such participation can have an impact on people and their well-being.  It can also have an impact on the development of the communities in which they live.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach highlighted the economic aspect of tourism, which is the third part of my portfolio.  I am of the view that this aspect can be developed to a much greater degree.  Some 200,000 people are employed in the tourism sector, which is worth &euro;5 billion to the economy.  We face a challenge in the context of ensuring we develop tourism, which is one of the few indigenous industries in this country.</P>

	<P>We spend a great deal of time attracting major foreign direct investment.  The companies involved make a major contribution in the context of creating jobs and contributing to the country&rsquo;s tax revenues.</P>
        <P>Along with agriculture, tourism is a natural industry.  We can develop it by marketing the country, by offering good value for money&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>And by getting rid of the travel tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and by demanding good standards.  My new Department is about us, as Irish people.  It is about who and what we are, but it is also about developing particular aspects of our economy.  I look forward to driving that development.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the new appointees to the Cabinet, Deputies Pat Carey and Tony Killeen, and wish them well.  I also congratulate those who have been appointed as Ministers of State.  It is a great honour and also a challenge to be granted ministerial responsibility.  I wish those who have been given such responsibility well.</P><Col N="41"/>
        <P>The presentation of the new Cabinet arrangements by the Taoiseach did not inspire confidence on my part.  It would have been very useful, in making his announcement on the reconfiguration of the Cabinet, if the Taoiseach had indicated at the outset the clear objectives that are to be achieved.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s contribution has been followed by contributions from other members of the Government which are hectoring in tone.  Successive Ministers have informed us that they were obliged to take the difficult decisions and that we opposed them.  They omitted to indicate that they took those decisions in respect of the wrong policy.</P>
        <P>Members of the public are currently asking whether anything has changed to a significant degree and whether, if such change has occurred, whether it will lead to their trusting the political system.  In that context, they are going to hone in on the problem of unemployment and ask whether the new arrangements relating to the Cabinet will make it possible to protect or create jobs.  They will also inquire whether those arrangements will help to address the needs of the 437,000 people who are unemployed.  I welcome the comments of the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, regarding the possibilities that exist in her new area of responsibility.  She was the exception among those opposite in that she referred to the area in respect of which she will have responsibility.  Other Ministers did not really do that.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste used material from the European Commission&rsquo;s report when she stated that Irish graduates are among the most employable in the western world.  Is it not then an incredible tragedy that so many of them are unemployed?  So much of the social capital that has been invested in these people will be lost if they are forced to emigrate.  Of course, we must hope that there may be opportunities abroad to which they might emigrate.</P>
        <P>What is happening is tragic.  We must get real and ask the relevant questions.  For example, where are the graduate placements across the public service and the semi-State sector that were promised?  The answer is that they do not exist.  That is a failure.  A brave Taoiseach would have stated that the old economic paradigm, including its international dimension, to which the current holder of the office of Taoiseach makes regular reference, is no more.  At the recent meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, Professor Patrick Honohan stated that market fundamentalism is gone.  There should be an admission of what it is that is dead.  The public should be informed as to what is new.</P>
        <P>Smart technocratic adjustments involving changing the people who are in charge of the lifeboats as the <i>Titanic</i> sinks will not achieve anything.  What is needed is a specification of priorities.  I will provide an example in that regard and I do not offer it as some form of intellectual abstraction.  I do not have the figures in front of me but I understand that there may be between &euro;18 billion and &euro;20 billion left in the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  What is to happen to this money?  Is it to be invested in the real economy in order to save it and to create jobs or will it be thrown into the black hole that is called the recapitalisation of some banks that were never of systemic importance?</P>
        <P>People are seeking an approach towards the economy that will redefine work, seize upon the benefits that are to be had from the green economy in the context of employment and recognise those who provide social care as workers.  In addition, people want the Government to identify the rich opportunities on offer in the cultural economy.  It is interesting that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, referred to the fact that the reputation of this country was achieved collectively by the Irish people and that they did not believe in extreme individualism.  That reputation was destroyed by those who drew upon a theory of market fundamentalism and who did not care tuppence for solidarity.  It is very interesting as we take a new direction that it is precisely those who believed in values of solidarity, community and inclusive citizenships who redefined the new economy.  We did not get that nor did the reconfiguration address what might achieve even a beginning of it.</P>

	<P>&ldquo;These unhappy times call for the building of plans that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.&rdquo;  So wrote Roosevelt in the heat and heart of the great depression in the United States.  While the United States is, as we know, a can do country with mottos such as &ldquo;change you can believe in&rdquo;, this sad Cabinet shuffled in today like a gone to seed athlete out of breath and certainly not fit for the sport for all with which the new Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport seemed to threatened us.</P>

	<P>All I can say is that &ldquo;Operation Transformation&rdquo; this was not.  As I was listening I thought I saw a ghost or two flit passed and look down not so fondly at the Taoiseach&rsquo;s head.  I thought I might have seen Bertie walking along.</P>

	<P>When various transformations in Bertie&rsquo;s life went ahead who did we see coming down the stairs of the D&aacute;il?  Was it Mr. McNamara, that late great tzar of Irish building, who was calling the shots for Fianna F&aacute;il on behalf of the developers and their friends in the banks?  Did I see Se&aacute;n Dunne, the person who went to the Queen and sessions in the United States as the key guest of the Irish Government?  I saw a mention in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech about a public services board to reform the public service.  If we rolled back the clock a year or two or three ago I am sure these senior figures in Irish business would have been key people for these boards along with that scion of Irish banking, Mr. FitzPatrick, and his cousin in Irish banking, Mr. Fingleton.</P>
        <P>Let us be honest about all of this.  We are in the middle of the greatest depression that Ireland has endured or experienced since the economic war.  Not even the Second World War produced the levels of unemployment to which the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il have reduced the country.  What do we get?  It is probably a very simple menu but we have F&Aacute;S a h-aon which will go to the Department of Education and Skills to remind the T&aacute;naiste of happier times in her previous Department.  F&Aacute;S a d&oacute; will go to the new Department of Social Protection.  F&Aacute;S a tr&iacute;, which might be the head of the organisation, will stay at its old Department.  We could put this to music.  It is almost like beidh aonach am&aacute;rach i gContae an Chl&aacute;ir because we will have F&Aacute;S a h-aon, F&Aacute;S a d&oacute; agus F&Aacute;S a tr&iacute;.

        <P>For many years, I have believed that unemployment is one of the greatest challenges that people face.  People often think of unemployment purely in terms of income loss.  However, it is also about dignity and confidence; the loss of something challenging to do every day; and the loss of connection with workmates.  Unemployment has a huge debilitating effect on individuals, families, communities and our nation.  We must always look at better ways of doing more with the resources that are there.  This will be a great challenge in the coming months and years.</P>
        <P>It makes ultimate sense to look at the activation side of the finance we will provide and the income support side to see whether there are ways to get better synergies in terms of those who wind up in the unfortunate situation of being unemployed and try to create a better future for them in the short term and to upskill them and give them opportunities so they get back into the mainstream workforce as speedily as possible.</P>
        <P>My new Department faces huge challenges.  It faces challenges in protecting the most vulnerable in our society.  It brings a new synergy to looking at job activation in its wider context with income support and will provide a one stop shop for people who face the terrible prospect of being unemployed.</P>
        <P>In the wider context, the re-organisation announced by the Taoiseach today focuses on the main challenges that face us.  We speak about an innovation economy but for that we must have organised best practice for upskilling people so they can avail of the huge opportunities out there.  In the re-organisation we will be able to tackle the issues of work and support for people and communities, and of upskilling, training and education.  I look forward to the new challenges I face; I know they will be huge but I have no doubt that with the support of my colleagues we will be able to overcome some of the massive challenges we face at this time.</P>

	<P>First, while Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have been accused of a lot by the Opposition, it must be acknowledged that over the past decade, they have transformed the research landscape in Ireland significantly.  This has had an impact on the type of inward investment that is coming in at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should read the research from UCC.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and on the type of new companies that are being formed via Enterprise Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should read the research.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">For example, if one compares the activities of multinational companies today to those of five years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should read the research from UCC.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Please.  I did not interrupt Deputy Burton.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Multinational companies today have a far greater research content than was the case five years ago.  The reforms announced by the Taoiseach today will streamline in particular the fourth level research arm of the State.  It will be brought under the aegis of a single Department to be called the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to ensure <Col N="45"/>a strong synergy between this research commitment, the enterprise economy and the recently-published report by the innovation task force.  Given our experiences, I believe this to be a good and solid measure to take.  Although the research landscape has been transformed, given the scale of the issue now facing us, we must streamline it as we move forward.  Second, I refer to skills and employment.  The proposed move of the skills and training section of F&Aacute;S to the Department of Education and Skills also is a positive step.  It also is clear that the Government transformed and expanded the education sector in the past decade.  A variety of programmes are in place, particularly in the post-leaving certificate sector in what now are called colleges of further education.  For example, the success in animation exemplified by the film &ldquo;Avatar&rdquo; was not a one-day wonder.  Colleges of further education, such as Ballyfermot Senior College, Col&aacute;iste Stiof&aacute;in Naofa, Cork, Cork College of Commerce and others throughout the country have made a distinctive contribution to the economy that has been supported by the Government in the past decade.  The marrying of this sector with the F&Aacute;S element will reduce an element of competition that was taking place between various State agencies and bodies in the field of skills provision.  It will streamline it further and will simplify and enhance it.  Its alignment with second level education and with the colleges of further education sector in particular constitutes a good switch.</P>
        <P>When one puts together the research and skills area with those of income support, labour activation and preparing people for a return to employment, a single theme emerges, namely, jobs.  While one must be clear that the economic crisis being experienced at present is global in nature, new ways are needed to work on one of our most significant challenges, that is, the hundreds of thousands of people who are unemployed.  The challenge is to activate people and in particular to transform into work the budgetary allocation in welfare and elsewhere.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will be taking on this significant challenge and the changes the Taoiseach has made in this regard makes sense.</P>
        <P>I believe Deputy Gilmore referred earlier to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s record in respect of employment in the past two years in office.  Public finances are key to employment and job creation, as are the banking structure and system.  While they are fundamental, the enterprise side comprises the third pillar in this regard.  I refer to the innovation task force, the commitment to research, science and development and to Ireland&rsquo;s indigenous enterprises, which still are strong and resilient.  Our exports have been more resilient than most in what one could describe as the modern side of the economy.  I acknowledge the construction and banking sectors took a massive hit, as did the retail sector as a consequence.  However, the life sciences, the ICT sector and the internationally traded services sector still are performing relatively well, despite the enormous collapse globally and the depressed demand for products and services internationally.  The Government has been preparing the country to put it on the right path to benefit in the first instance from an economic upturn that undoubtedly will occur towards the latter part of 2010 and to ensure the correct orientation and policy platforms are in place to drive forward the country and place it on the road to recovery.</P>
        <P>As for the international perspective on Ireland, I visited the United States for St. Patrick&rsquo;s week and have discussed the matter with other returning Ministers.  We have passed the Lisbon treaty and have transformed the international perception of Ireland.  Moreover, I note the international perception of the policies the Government has taken differs greatly from domestic perception.  The overriding view of the international community is that Ireland has taken the correct policy decisions to take itself out of this economic crisis.  This perception is shared across the globe if one talks to economists, media commentators, people in business or in any walk of life.  They are somewhat further away and will state that while the measures are extremely painful and are difficult for people in both the public or private sectors, in essence Ireland is taking the correct policy decisions with regard to the public finances, the creation of <Col N="46"/>a vehicle to deal with an unprecedented banking crisis and our focus on an enterprise export-oriented economy.  As for the decisions the Taoiseach has taken today, the appointments and promotions are well merited and I believe the significant restructuring will endure in the years to come.  Were people not so blinded by their needs to oppose, I believe that privately, many Members on the other side of the House would consider the policies being implemented today to be highly sensible.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>Yes.</P>
        <P>I listened to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, refer to speeches made by Members of the Opposition as being superficial and shallow.  Deputy Martin was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment as Ireland slid down the competitive league like a downhill skier.  Despite numerous reports, the Minister did nothing as we slipped down that chain.  Consequently, the Minister is as culpable as anyone else for the difficulties in which we found ourselves as our exports tumbled and our competitiveness stumbled.  The Minister held the reins during that period and while the finger of blame has not pointed at him yet, it will do so in time to come.  Certainly, when historians examine this period, he will be blamed.</P>

	<P>On a personal level, I congratulate Deputies Pat Carey, Killeen, Curran, Connick, White and Cuffe.  Members certainly will miss Deputy Dooley hectoring and heckling in the Chamber, as he is more likely to be seen around Spancil Hill hereafter than on the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenches, as he tries to save his political hide.  As Minister for Finance after the last general election, the Taoiseach was not terribly happy that the Green Party was joining the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I negotiated a programme of Government with the Green Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>He did so under stress and duress.  The chickens certainly are coming home to roost today, as has the ethos of the Green Party, in so far as it has been articulated by its Members.  The fault I see in the Green Party Members is that they pretended to be different from others when they were no different from most.  There is a certain resonance between the difficulties in which the Labour Party in England finds itself today and the manner in which the Green Party has come full circle.  It is all about jobs for the boys in the Green Party.  Deputy Gogarty is the black sheep of the family.  I do not know how he will be fitted in over the next couple of years and do not know the reason he has been singled out.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="47"/>

	<P>Rolling along.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>In his contribution, the Taoiseach mentioned his belief that the worst is over.  This reiterates the line taken by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, during his budget speech.  However, I cannot see any tangible evidence that the worst is over.  The Taoiseach also stated that the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be renamed to become the Department of Social Protection.  I made an appeal some weeks ago about a person who has encountered a social welfare difficulty and received a response to the effect that due to industrial action, the office in question was not dealing with queries from elected representatives until further notice.  Is this the Department of Social Protection to which the Taoiseach refers?  I am disappointed the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, has left the Chamber because I wish to mention the queues extending along Molesworth Street.  Although people have an explicit right to travel under the Constitution and under the European Convention on Human Rights, they cannot get a passport.  This difficulty did not arise yesterday or last Friday.  It has been escalating for the past couple of months.  As the Taoiseach and I know, every March, April and May are the peak months during which people seek to have their passports processed.</P>
        <P>There is room to manoeuvre under the Passports Act 2008.  The Minister could examine the concept of extending the valid period of passports.  In section 15 of the Act, reference is made to the issuing of emergency travel documentation.  I ask the Taoiseach to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs examine the concept of issuing emergency travel documentation, as it can be done.  It just needs political will, but the Government has adopted an approach to the public sector&rsquo;s go-slow of masquerading around as if nothing has occurred.  Essential services are being denied to the public, but the issue on Molesworth Street is only the tip of the iceberg.  I ask the Taoiseach to do something about the matter, since it will not go away unless the Government acts.  However, the Government has stood idly by while the problem escalated.</P>
        <P>It has been mentioned that people will miss holidays, but we are also discussing tourism and business, every aspect of life which has been affected.  It is not just a matter of someone hoping to visit the Costa del Sol for a week, a football team or young person going on a holiday or a student exchange.  It is also about business transactions, commerce and tourism.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach mentioned reinvigoration and a fresh focus.  This certainly is not a reinvigoration and it certainly will not provide a fresh focus.  I have listened to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statements in recent months on how the Government has been penalised in the opinion polls because it took the difficult decisions, but the Government is being penalised because it failed to take the difficult decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I sincerely congratulate Deputies Pat Carey and Killeen, people who are well fit to be in the Government, and their families on this great occasion of their elevation to the Cabinet.  I also congratulate my constituency colleague, Deputy White of the Green Party, and Deputy Connick, who lives in County Kilkenny but represents County Wexford and to whom we refer as the sixth Deputy from Carlow-Kilkenny, on their elevation to the rank of Ministers of State.  They deserve a role in whatever is left of the Government&rsquo;s term of office.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and I know that he carried out a little reshuffle to keep the show on the road for another while.  The mention of reconfiguration was nothing more than spin.  There will be no proper changes in Departments, only tinkering around the edges.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s conservative and safe approach won out again in this so-called Cabinet reshuffle.  It is business as usual, in that the same people will be in charge of the country for the purpose of deciding policy for the next while.</P><Col N="48"/>
        <P>This is my opportunity to ask about the main talking point.  Why did the Taoiseach cave into the Green Party again and give it a second Minister of State?  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s backbenchers, not one of whom is to be seen, are seething with anger about this.  The political imperative was survival.</P>

	<P>The Government parties will survive for as long as they can.  Politically, they must hang together or else they will hang separately.  Today&rsquo;s reshuffle is about politics, not the reconfiguration of Departments or the nonsense we heard from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, on innovation and research.  Those constitute parts of existing Departments and it is for those budgets to perform.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  He is a clever politician if he was able to extract another Minister of State from the Taoiseach.  There were 20 Ministers of State at the time of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and there are 15 now.  The Minister had a willing horse in the present Taoiseach, who wants to ensure that the Government will survive for as long as possible by tying in the Green Party.  However, the Taoiseach did not need to do so because the Green Party is well tied into the Government.  That party is prepared to take any punishment it is given on banking, employment, health policy or so on.</P>
        <P>The Minister talks a lot about various matters and makes many public statements, but he does not walk the walk.  Where is he concerning the accountability required in the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA?  He does not want to investigate its corporate governance issues and decisions made by boards of directors and others that have exposed the taxpayer to a significant degree.  We have heard nothing from him in this respect.  He is bogged down in a legal quagmire with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office or other legal people.  We will wait the shortest possible time to determine whether he is walking the walk or just talking the talk in respect of this issue.  Has he made any decisions since becoming a Minister that will expose the taxpayer further, given how previous decisions exposed the taxpayer significantly?</P>

	<P>I join with colleagues in wishing Deputies Pat Carey, Tony Killeen and John Curran well in their new portfolios and I congratulate my colleagues, Deputies Se&aacute;n Connick, Mary Alexandra White and Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe on their new appointments.  I look forward to working with them.  I thank the Taoiseach for assigning me extra responsibilities and I look forward to working with him and the Minister for Finance on the transformation of the public service, which is one of the key challenges facing the Government in the coming months and years.  We can have a public service that will make a highly significant contribution to sustainable economic recovery and renewal.</P>
        <P>We need a public service that is better integrated to meet the needs of citizens, that is fit for purpose and affordable.  We must renew our focus on what is achieved and how we can improve outcomes across the public service, while simultaneously focusing on reducing the cost of doing business, not just for Government but for citizens interacting.  Doing more for less is not just <Col N="53"/>an economic imperative, it presents us with the opportunity to reconfigure how public services are delivered and to re-engineer processes across the Government system, in agreement with those who work in it.</P>
        <P>Our policy priorities in economic and social policy areas are clearly set out in the revised programme for Government and in other key policy frameworks published in the last 12 months.  No one doubts what needs to be achieved and the critical task now is to drive the implementation of those policies.</P>
        <P>The ongoing pressure on resources means that progress is essential and urgent.  The citizen must be at the centre of everything the public service does.  We want to remove barriers between different branches of the public service and different organisations to make sure there is clarity of purpose, a stronger leadership and better co-operation.  We need a more joined-up Government to respond to the joined-up needs of our people as they live their lives and look after their families. The emphasis must be on the citizen.</P>
        <P>We want to see an ongoing expansion in the services available on-line to the individual and particularly to businesses.  We have to apply new technology, some of which has been developed within the public service, to boost productivity and improve customer service.  We also need to share information more widely across the system and in the process reduce the burden placed on citizens and businesses.  To achieve our objectives here it will be necessary to make strategic investments in innovative technologies and to acquire specialist skills which may not be currently available.</P>
        <P>There must be a major reshaping of how we manage our public service. We have to re-engineer the way we do business so that the various components of our services are delivered in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible.  One important opportunity to do this is through developing shared services which achieve economies of scale and the opportunity to innovate and streamline procedures, which will be a particular focus of mine in the coming weeks.  There are many examples of how this approach to managing standardised procedures could generate very substantial savings, without compromising standards.  In particular, I look forward to working closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh on public procurement reform, especially with small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
        <P>The key element in the public service are the people.  The greatest asset of our public service are those who work in it every day delivering diverse and varied services to each citizen.  They have a commitment which I want to harness and a knowledge and professionalism which I want to use to reshape our public services, in agreement with them, to ensure they are efficient, effective and focused on our people.</P>
        <P>Progress has been made on the reform agenda in recent times.  We must now dramatically accelerate that reform.  Current discussions between the public service management and unions are being facilitated by Mr. Kevin Duffy and Mr. Kieran Mulvey.  All parties must engage in this process in good faith.  This is the appropriate forum for all of us to direct our energies and opinions at the current time.</P>
        <P>It is clear to me that there is a shared view on the sort of changes across the public service that would produce greater efficiency and better services for the public and more satisfactory working conditions for public servants.  We now need to reach a realistic and fair agreement so that we can move on with the priorities of transformation.</P>
        <P>The public interest and the long-term interest of public servants coincide with those of the Government and our citizens in creating a public service of which we can be proud and, equally, a public service which we can afford.  There is much hard work and challenges ahead but I look forward to working with public servants right across the system and with stakeholders in the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance.</P>

I am disappointed he has not been promoted and I merely want to make a case for him.</P>
        <P>The other person I am sorry for is Deputy Mattie McGrath.  He is the only person on the Government benches who speaks common sense.  I thought he could be added to the Cabinet and would strengthen the Government but they would not appoint him.</P>
        <P>I am delighted Deputy Pat Carey has joined the Cabinet.  He is a decent man and I know he will do well.  I hope things go well for him.  I have always found him to he honourable and decent as Chief Whip and as a Minister of State.  His appointment is a great honour and I wish him success in it.  However, I hope he will not be there for too long.  I also wish Deputy Tony Killeen well.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Taoiseach had an opportunity to reshuffle the Cabinet and he did not do so.  I am reminded of the Titanic.  He merely moved the ship nearer to the water.  It is about to sink.  There was no reshuffle today.  I hope the media have not been taken in and will tell us we had a reshuffle.  We did not.  All that happened was that two Ministers retired and were replaced by two backbenchers.  The Taoiseach had plenty of talent on the backbenches but he did not take the opportunity presented to reshuffle the Cabinet.  The country needs new leadership, a new Government and new thinking.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, spoke about the public service.  The point at issue is not related to the provision of passports, about which everybody is talking.  A woman, who is in receipt of social welfare benefit, told me this morning that she had spent &euro;28 of her &euro;30 phone credit trying to get through to the Longford office regarding her family income supplement benefit.

Will the Taoiseach and the Government do something about the public <Col N="55"/>service because people are suffering?  We are not suffering in here but the people are suffering.  The Government has created this mess and it must get us out of it because what is happening is not right.  The current position suits the Government because it is not letting us make it accountable.  It is not replying to parliamentary questions.  We cannot deal with the issues that need to be addressed because we do not have the required information.  I want this dispute resolved in whatever way it can be resolved.  The Taoiseach had a chance today to do something about the Government, to give it a new image and to bring in new ideas for the country, but he failed.  Instead of the three by-elections that are due to be held, we want an election in the 43 constituencies; we need a general election and we need it now.  The people of the country should not be giving out about those in government, it should get it out.  That is what we want to do.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed he has left or levitated out of the Chamber.  We have a new definition of green jobs, given that the only people to get the leg up in terms of this reshuffle are the two green backbenchers.  It is quite extraordinary.  I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste on her nomination as the new Minister for Education and Skills.  I understand Deputy Varadkar said that he would look forward to our interventions across the floor of the House.  I can assure the T&aacute;naiste I am a pussycat by comparison to Deputy Varadkar.  </P>
        <P>I also congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, on his nomination to the new post.  I also congratulate the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, the effective Marc Antony of this Administration in that he has the ear of Caesar, on his nomination as the new Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the question of education, the Taoiseach has hived off the fourth level research section from the Department of Education and Science to the new Department of Enterprise and Employment without also including third level education with it.  That is dysfunctional.  We, effectively, have a new Department of Education and Skills, which will also have some funding for F&Aacute;S in terms of retraining, which is a good thing but the problem is that the Department is too big.  It is effectively a Department of schools.  It does not have any interest in further education, training opportunities or even higher level education.  This Department, which is already too big is to become bigger under the reshuffle.  There is a disconnect between what the Taoiseach wants to do in terms of research, laudable as it is, and not having attached to it the third level sector.  The third level sector will still come under the Department of Education and Skills while the fourth level sector, research, will come under the new Department.  Where is the connectivity in policy in that regard, which the Taoiseach is trying to achieve?  I know he is trying to achieve more commercialisation of the research budget, which is now significant, but I do not believe he will succeed.</P>
        <P>The Departments of enterprise, education and social welfare will now have a foot, as it were, on F&Aacute;S.  This is bizarre.  F&Aacute;S will no longer be answerable to one Minister in one Department but, effectively, will be answerable to three Ministers in three Departments.  That will not solve the problems we face at a policy level within any of those Departments.</P>
        <P>On the day Deputy Cowen became Taoiseach he highlighted the issue of public service reform as the number one concern.  He said that by September he would have his plans for that reform, but he did not achieve that benchmark.  The notion that public service reform can <Col N="56"/>be achieved by moving a few Ministers around a few Departments without changing the way in which the public service deals with the public is total anathema.  There is no sense of a radical idea of public service reform in this reshuffle, limited as it is.</P>
        <P>This is a good day for those Ministers who have been given an opportunity to serve in high office, and I congratulate them, but this country needs a new start.  It will not get a new start from the same group of people who have led this country into the mire during the past 13 years in government.  The public see through that, as does everyone else, and that is why there will be no great change as a result of this reshuffle.</P>

        <P>The House was divided earlier this afternoon by the intervention of the Labour Party on the allocation of time for this discussion.  It was suggested that there was insufficient time to debate the appointment of the Ministers.  While some useful contributions were made from the benches opposite, having listened to some of the contributions, there was a sufficient allocation of time for this debate.  The parties opposite have complained that we have been too long in government, but the big problem with them is that they have been far too long in Opposition.

        <P Just="Left">I begin with the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet.  He stated a few weeks ago that in the case of Ireland, very very tough decisions had been made by the Government, and rightly so.  His colleague on the governing council of the European Central Bank, Jos&eacute; Manuel Gonz&aacute;lez-P&aacute;ramo, said: &ldquo;The Irish measures are very courageous.  They are going in the right direction.&rdquo;  The French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, commended the determination of the Irish people in their response to the crisis.  She said that Ireland has set the high standard that the rest of us must follow.  Then we have the views of the German Minister for European Affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He said: &ldquo;I think there is a deeply rooted trust and confidence in this country&rsquo;s ability to sort out its problems ...  There is a fundamental belief that the Irish are going to solve it ...&rdquo;  They are political views; they are not manufactured views.  These are <Col N="57"/>reactions to visible decisions made by an Irish Government and these are the responses around the world to these decisions.  Commentators from these countries have been equally impressed by the decisions of the Government.  Take the view, for example, of the Citi chief economist Willem Buiter, who said Ireland&rsquo;s intelligently designed approach to restoring fiscal stability is a model of how to do things.  Martin Wolf, the chief economics editor of the <i>Financial Times</i> said last month, that he admired very much what the Irish policy makers have done.

	<P>That is why they are worried now.  That is why they are queuing outside the Passport Office.</P>

	<P>Deputy Durkan, please allow the Minister to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The people are perfectly free to comment on the exercise of that mandate at the expiration of the appropriate constitutional terms.  That is the position.  We live in a representative democracy.  The leader of the Labour Party suggested today that we do not, that we should have a Government by opinion poll, that mandates expire on the basis of opinion polls and that the will of the people is that this Government should leave office.  The will of the people was expressed in May 2007 and the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party were incapable of devising a cohesive programme to persuade the people on that occasion to give my party a break after two terms in office.</P>

	<P>Of what is the Minister afraid?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a major onus on the Opposition parties to give people a valid alternative.  On the basis of this afternoon&rsquo;s debate, there is little sign of one being offered. </P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will come.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="58"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have in place a plan which will put the country on the path to economic growth.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Unemployment will not be as high as previously forecast, consumer confidence is reviving, export figures are the healthiest in Europe and we are regaining our competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Speakers on the opposite side suggest the Government should resign and appeal to the people but where is the alternative Government?  The Fine Gael Party supported public sector pay cuts; the Labour Party rejects them.  The Labour Party wants an extra &euro;2.3 billion in annual taxation; the Fine Gael Party argues one cannot tax oneself to a recovery.  Fine Gael sought selective cuts in unemployment payments; the Labour Party rejects all welfare reductions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should talk about the new Ministers. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us be clear, the Fine Gael Party supports a bank guarantee and rejects nationalisation, while the Labour Party rejects a bank guarantee and supports nationalisation. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has bought off the Green Party again.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Irish people are being invited to believe that an immediate general election is in their best interests and will bring these parties to Government without any programme as to how the country can advance.</P>
        <P>I heard Deputy Burton describe the current economic problems as the most serious since the 1920s and 1930s.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I remind Deputy Burton that this country had very severe economic problems in the 1950s and 1980s, one of the major root causes of which was the inability of the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party to agree on a coherent economic policy platform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the inability of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Remember 1977.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We should also remember 1997. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Irish people face the same historic danger if the Opposition does not get its act together and start offering them an intellectually coherent alternative to a policy which this Government has put forward to international acclaim. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Buy them off.  Bribe them.  The Minister should tell us about the Government. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="59"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The task facing Government in the months ahead, which I accept is onerous for a Government that has held office for as long as we have, is to translate this international confidence into confidence at home. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We have 434,000 people on the dole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have to believe in ourselves as a people and ignore the contradictory guff coming from the other parties in this House.  We have to face up to the fact that what others are saying about us is right.</P>

	<P>What did Paul Krugman and Simon Johnson say about Ireland?</P>

	<P>One American socialist does not make a summer. </P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We know the credentials of the economists in question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is highly selective.  He should tell us what Professors Krugman and Johnson said.  Let us have some honesty. </P>

	<P>Last weekend, Deputy Kenny hosted a party conference&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a massive success. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;at which the Fine Gael Party made clear that, having argued last April that we needed a &euro;3.5 billion correction for 2011, it now advocates a &euro;2 billion adjustment, all of which is to be made on current spending.  Again, details of how and where cuts will be made were not given. </P>

	<P>Who wrote this stuff for the Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is most worrying about what Fine Gael is now proposing is that the party is reneging on our commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact.  It is pursuing a Greek option, the course pursued in Greece until recently. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>

	<P>Let us be clear.  We have regained the confidence of international markets and investors.  The outside world knows we can deal with our difficulties.  We will rebuild domestic confidence and the confidence to invest and create jobs and renew the economy.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I propose to share time with Deputies O&rsquo;Dowd, Breen, Clune, Feighan, O&rsquo;Donnell and Deenihan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is estimated that some 31,000 jobs were lost in the tourism industry last year and 21,000 the year before that.  It is certain that more jobs will be lost this year.  The tragedy is that this could be avoided and that it is possible for the tourism industry to have a bright future.  A thriving tourism sector is essential because the economy will only recover through growth in export services industries such as tourism.  However, that will happen only if the Government stops putting barriers in the way of the success of the tourist industry.  Those barriers are causing significant problems for the sector, with the result that jobs and revenues are being lost and damage done to our international reputation.</P>
        <P>How long more does the Government intend to ignore these barriers to business?  At what point in the scale of job losses will it realise it is dealing not with an industry that is crying wolf but with an industry <i>in extremis</i>?  I have spoken at great length and on many occasions about the enormous damage the travel tax is doing, as airlines take their aircraft and their business elsewhere.  The Government can no longer pretend that the drop in capacity and routes into Ireland is down to a worldwide recession.  If that were the case, seat capacity into Ireland this summer would not be down 13% when that for Europe as a whole has increased by 5%.  We are not all in the same boat, as the Government would have us believe.</P><Col N="63"/>
        <P>In January, Dublin Airport Authority traffic was down by 300,000 passengers, but Ryanair grew its passengers by 400,000.  As far as seat capacity is concerned, we are the worst performing European country.  As an island country, we should strive to be the best.  We are worse even than the Ukraine, which is hardly a renowned tourist destination.  If further proof were needed that this is a home-grown problem, it is that last year, our main airlines  &mdash; Ryanair and Aer Lingus &mdash; both carried more tourists but did not carry them to Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is beyond me how this tax was conceived and then imposed.  It is the same, and as damaging, as taxing exports.  It could only have been allowed to slip through the net of good sense by a Government totally devoid of an aviation policy or any grasp or interest in what an island must do to remain competitive in the tourism market.  I am aghast at the Government&rsquo;s countermotion which offers absolute and final proof that the Government &mdash; and, worryingly, the Minister for Finance &mdash; has simply not grasped the problem at all.  According to the countermotion, the impact of the travel tax &ldquo;has been considerably overstated in the context of overall purchasing decisions by visitors&rdquo;.  That argument is a nonsense because it is not visitors who make those purchasing decisions.  It is the airlines that pay this tax and they, unlike the Government, know that if they pass it on, they will lose even more customers.  The direct impact is on airline pockets, not on visitors&rsquo; pockets.  The impact on them is indirect in that they are losing flights into Ireland.  The reality is that consumers at home and abroad have lost all connectivity.  There are now 24 fewer destinations to which one can fly from Ireland than was the case 18 months ago.</P>
        <P>The advice from everybody with knowledge of the industry is that this tax is damaging Ireland.  The Government&rsquo;s own adviser on tourism, the tourism renewal group advised against it, as have the Commission on Taxation, IBEC, ITEC, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the National Competitiveness Council.  It is time for the Government to take its head out of the sand, swallow its pride and axe this tax before any more jobs are lost.  It is particularly worrying that the Minister for Finance has not grasped the nature of the problem, particularly as he has taken in between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million from Aer Lingus, which is losing money hand over fist.  This tax is endangering the viability of that airline.</P>
        <P>The Government has also sat on its hands on the issue of the zombie hotels.  Tut tutting and shaking of heads in disapproval is not action.  Insolvent hotels should not be kept artificially alive by banks which themselves are being kept artificially alive by taxpayers.  We have blatant examples of predatory pricing, reckless trading, below-cost selling, unfair trading and grossly anti-competitive practices from both the banks and the hotels they are propping up.  Why does the Government remain silent when the laws of the land are being flouted, good businesses deprived of credit and all the normal laws of the market turned on their head?  The reality is that for good hotels to survive, insolvent ones must fail.  There is no good outcome to this situation of oversupply of hotel beds.  We all know how that came about and I will not go into it.  There is only a least worst scenario.  Postponing the normal market correction is destroying businesses that might survive and propping up those that are clearly not viable.</P>
        <P>The least worst option is to allow the creditors in and to have the hotels sold off for change of use or as going concerns.  Inevitably jobs will be lost and hotels will close, but the sooner the correction takes place, the sooner normal trading can return to the sector.  It is vital that NAMA does not prolong the agony by nursing failed businesses along.  Rescuing the banks should not be at the expense of destroying good businesses.  The oversupply in the hotel sector is a salutary lesson on the folly of maintaining tax reliefs when they are no longer appropriate and of allowing vested interests to dictate tax policy against the advice of experts.</P>
        <P>An issue of extraordinary urgency as the season begins is car hire.  Some 30% of visitors to Ireland hire a car, and 40% of visitors from the United States do so.  If such visitors cannot <Col N="64"/>hire a car, they will not come.  Already this year there are reports of Americans cancelling holiday bookings because they cannot hire a car with automatic transmission.  If they have not booked by early summer, any further inquiries will have to be turned away.  This is absolute madness and, once again, a self-inflicted difficulty on the part of the Government.  In 2006 the car rental fleet was 31,000 cars.  This year it will be between 10,000 and 12,500, as a direct result of Government budgetary measures.  In part, this was due to the scrappage scheme and, as such, was an unintended consequence.  However, it is also the result of two calculated decisions.  The first of these was the imposition of a penal tax on automatic cars, apparently for environmental reasons.  The reality is that, in general, drivers of automatic cars in this State are either disabled or are visitors from the United States.  Second, the vehicle registration tax advantage that was in place for years &mdash; including, perversely, during the Celtic tiger years when it was not needed &mdash; is being withdrawn at the worst possible time and with the worst possible consequences for the industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister ignores this issue at his peril.  The damage it will do this year is incalculable, but it will also do long-term reputational damage and will send out a clear message that Ireland is simply not geared up for tourists.  The notion that potential visitors from the United States would find in March or April that there are no cars to hire is absurd.  That is the last message we should be sending.  The Minister for Finance knows about this problem but has chosen to ignore it.  He will effectively write off an entire season and cause long-term damage if he does not take immediate measures to address the situation.</P>
        <P>Another issue that has received considerable publicity in recent months is that of visas.  The cost and complexity of getting a visa is a deterrent to those areas where we expect the travel market to grow in the coming years.  A tour company bringing people from China or India to Europe must get a Schengen visa, a British visa and an Irish visa if it wants to come here.  The &euro;60 cost is a deterrent, but if one had to answer all the questions required for entry to Ireland, one would lose the will to live, much less travel.  I understand that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform needs to protect the integrity of our borders, but it also has a responsibility to pursue the wider national interest to protect jobs, to promote Ireland and at the very least, not to frustrate the efforts of other Departments and agencies.  We spend millions every year marketing the country, yet there seems to be almost a concerted plan on the part of other Departments to thwart and frustrate tourism efforts.  There is a visa issue with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a car hire issue with the Department of Finance, a travel tax issue with the Department of Transport, while the OPW&rsquo;s attitude to the broader tourism drive is another issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The OPW has control over many of our national monuments, gardens, buildings and historic sites.  It is second to none for conservation and restoration, but if it denies access or makes access to visitors difficult, it is a sterile undertaking.  What is the point of conserving things if nobody can see them or use them?  It seems as if the OPW does not see it as its function to facilitate visitors.  The OPW alone was the only facilities provider in Ireland to increase prices last year.  It is slow to publish opening schedules, provide guides when required or even to open sites to visitors at reasonable hours.  The OPW just does not see itself as part of the national tourism effort or the national recovery drive, and neither do many of the other Departments.  I do not altogether blame the OPW for this, because there is no commercial incentive to open longer or sell itself better.  When its budgets are cut, the inevitable response is to cut staff and opening hours.  There is a real case to be made for outsourcing the management of OPW sites and to leave the OPW with the upkeep.  There should be no conflict between conservation and tourism, and national treasures should be marshalled to operate in the national interest.</P><Col N="65"/>
        <P>The Government-imposed barriers to business, the lack of co-operation between Departments and agencies, the examples of Departments actually working at cross purposes to one another, can only happen if an industry is not taken seriously at the top.  It seems to me that this is the case and that the Government just does not rate tourism or recognise its huge potential to be not just a direct provider of jobs, but to be a real driver of the national economic recovery.  An opportunity was lost today by not putting tourism in an economic Department.</P>
        <P>The industry itself, despite all its difficulties, is trying to respond to the very changed climate.  It is becoming more competitive.  Restaurants and hotels are offering reduced prices and deals, but we still have a long way to go if we are to compete with the many other attractive and cheaper holiday destinations available worldwide.  We have to remember we are competing for tourists in a global market.  They can only bring their prices down further if, in turn, the price of their inputs come down.  I do not have time tonight to deal with prices but my colleagues will speak about industry costs, and I hope to return to the issue tomorrow night.  Wages and rates are big issues for the tourism industry, which is very labour intensive.  I have said many times before that tourism is a fragmented and geographically dispersed industry.  It consists of many small and disparate businesses, but they all have one thing in common.  They need tourists.  That means Ireland, as an island, needs better air access than any other competing country.  However, as a direct result of the air travel tax we are becoming increasingly inaccessible, and that spells death to Irish tourism, to Irish jobs and Irish businesses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion put forward by Deputy Mitchell.  When I first heard the debate about the travel tax, I thought that Ryanair and Aer Lingus were overstating their case.  When I met with representatives of both companies, they showed me their figures and the statistics are exceptionally clear that the &euro;10 travel tax has a significant impact on their fares.  They showed me how Internet bookings are very price sensitive.  While a &euro;10 tax may seem very little, it actually stops people from coming to this country.</P>
        <P>The important thing about this motion is that we are concentrating on the Government and on an issue that has a negative impact on our tourism industry.  It is time for the Government to think again.  Tourism is one of the easiest areas in which new jobs can be created.  Tourism also has a significant seasonal impact.  Removing the tourist travel tax will lead to a massive spin off and will be inversely proportionate to what is happening now.  There will be significant growth in the number of people coming into Ireland to spend more money.  There will be a spin off with the creation of new jobs and it will also help the airlines.</P>
        <P>The airlines are one thing and the airports are quite another thing.  We need to make our airports cheaper for our airlines to use and to make them more attractive and more cost competitive.  I am amazed that the Government spent &euro;850,000 for a tendering competition that it never completed to build a second terminal at Dublin Airport.  It wasted taxpayers&rsquo; money in an apparently significant attempt to get competitive tendering to run the airport.  A number of multinational companies competed which had access to billions of euro and which employed tens of thousands of people in airports around the world, but the Dublin Airport Authority was fast-tracked outside this competition.  The Government decided that none of the competing companies qualified, so the DAA got the contract.  The DAA also runs the airports in Cork and in Shannon.  It is a fix for the State monopoly, and it is a monopoly that does not make sense.  It is shameful that those international companies that entered into this process did not make it to the second stage.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policies are ossified.  There is a State monopoly running our airports and it is losing money hand over fist.  It is driving airlines out of this country and Government policy is keeping tourists out.  It is an indication of how the Government is out of touch.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="66"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am currently compiling a report for the Council of Europe on the crisis confronting the European civil aviation industry.  As part of this work, I met the CEO of Air France-KLM last Friday in Paris, Mr. Pierre Henri Gourgeon.  He described Ireland&rsquo;s decision to introduce the &euro;10 air travel tax in the middle of a recession as a disaster for an island nation that is so dependent on air access.  He pointed out that the Dutch Government moved quickly to axe a similar tax when it was introduced in Holland, having witnessed the dramatic effect it had on passenger figures.  Schipol Airport lost over 1 million passengers following its introduction. </P>
        <P>When air services are axed or capacity is reduced, it hurts tourism, airlines, airports &mdash; including Shannon &mdash; and car hire companies.  It has certainly hurt our region.  Recently, I met a taxi driver who waited outside the terminal building at Shannon Airport from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. before picking up his first run.  Bed and breakfast establishments, hotels and publicans are also feeling the pinch.  Airlines across the globe are axing jobs, including Aer Lingus.  Many workers at Shannon Airport are fearful for their future, having already made big sacrifices in their efforts to try to secure the airline&rsquo;s viability.  There is also uncertainty about the future of its vital Shannon operations, including the maintenance base.</P>
        <P>We are now on the verge of losing a significant amount of Ryanair business at Shannon.  The arrival of Ryanair transformed that airport five years ago, delivering passenger numbers from 300,000 in 2004 to 1.9 million last year.  That was prior to the introduction of the air travel tax.  Several of Ryanair&rsquo;s popular holiday routes were supported by people all over the west.  In addition, the entire western seaboard from Donegal to Cork now has no connectivity to the EU&rsquo;s main administrative centre in Brussels, which is a disaster for companies in the region.</P>
        <P>This week, a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> suggested that the Dublin Airport Authority is considering introducing a levy for passengers departing from Shannon.  We do not know if this levy is an additional tax, a proposal to transfer taxes paid by passengers directly to airlines, or simply another income stream for the Dublin Airport Authority to fund the costly T2 terminal.  Whatever the case, and many issues have to be clarified in this respect, it is clear that before any further discussions take place on airline charges or additional levies, the &euro;10 air travel tax must be abolished.  It has been a disaster for the aviation sector.</P>
        <P>As Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd said, Ryanair, Aer Lingus and CityJet do not often speak with one voice, but they have now called for this tax to be abolished.  Michael O&rsquo;Leary has said that he will reinstate routes at Shannon and Dublin airports if the tax is abolished, which would bring more tourists into the country.  Last Friday, the CEO of Air France told me that it is only a matter of time before the tax is abolished anyway, as the loss of revenue for airlines, airports and the tourism sector far outweighs the amount of revenue collected from the tax.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed there is not a single Cabinet Minister here.  Where are the Ministers for Finance and Transport?  Where are the Government backbenchers?  It shows the interest they have in the tourism sector and in abolishing the travel tax.  The Minister of State should tell the Minister to have the courage to call Michael O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s bluff on the travel tax in order to reinstate these flights.  Mr. O&rsquo;Leary won the PR battle on hangar 6.  A wise man once said, &ldquo;If you are willing to admit you are wrong, you are right&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Deputy Tony Killeen on his appointment as Minister for Defence.  He should have the courage to let Shannon&rsquo;s voice be heard at the Cabinet table.  This tax should be abolished because it is counter-productive.  Shannon Airport and the mid-west should have the breathing space they need to ride out the recession.  I commend Deputy Mitchell for bringing this timely motion before the House.  I hope the Government will heed it.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="67"/>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to support this motion that has one simple message, namely, to abolish the &euro;10 airport tax that is crippling the tourism industry.  We are going through a global recession and both air traffic and tourism have suffered as a result.  Passenger figures for international airports are levelling off, while some are increasing.  Sadly, however, the figures for Ireland continue to deteriorate and even the latest figures for the early months of this year show a decline.  </P>
        <P>Last year, tourism revenue dropped by &euro;1.1 billion on the previous year.  Meanwhile, overseas visitor numbers fell by almost 1 million over the same period, which represents an 11.6% drop.  The UK is Ireland&rsquo;s largest tourism market but UK visitors declined by 16% in 2009.  Visitors from North America were also down, by 8%.  There has been a consequent effect on employment in the sector.  It is estimated that 31,000 jobs were lost last year and, unfortunately, it is predicted that a further 10,000 jobs will be lost this year.  Those are stark figures.  It does not stack up to say that there is a global recession because figures for other European cities are stabilising.</P>
        <P>We must re-examine this punitive travel tax which has been imposed.  Previous speakers have said that airlines can clearly track passenger movements showing that the &euro;10 tax is a disincentive for intending visitors.  It is nonsensical to impose such a tax on a small island nation that is so dependent on air connections to mainland Europe and the USA.  The tax is strangling our airports and tourism sector.  It makes no sense.  The tax was introduced previously in other countries but they quickly saw the folly of their ways and abandoned it.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Government parties to examine this matter sensibly.  We have heard about the downward figures and the pleas from airlines to abolish the tax.  Let us put it up to those airlines and ask them whether they will restore axed routes to our airports if the tax is abolished.</P>
        <P>The situation is serious.  I speak as a Deputy representing the constituency which includes Cork Airport.  Last year, passenger numbers through Cork Airport were down by 15%, falling from 3.25 million in 2008 to 2.7 million in 2009.  The figures for January this year are down by 17%, which is alarming.  In recent weeks, we have lost two vital connections to the UK because BMI pulled two routes.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this punitive tax, which makes no sense to an island nation.</P>
        <P>While Shannon can speak for itself, I wish to appeal for the independence of Cork Airport.  It does not make any sense for the Dublin Airport Authority to make decisions for Cork.  The DAA does not have a sense of what is going on in the Cork region or what a vital piece of infrastructure Cork airport is.  An independent airport could act on its own behalf, while competing with other airports on this island.  We need such competition which would bring energy and enthusiasm to the airport.  The word &ldquo;competition&rdquo; does not exist in the Minister&rsquo;s vocabulary, but this important strategic decision could and should be taken by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Mitchell for bringing this important motion before the House.  I appeal once again to the Government to admit it has made a mistake of gross proportions.  This tax is anti-rural, anti-development and anti-regional.  Ireland West International Airport at Knock, which is close to where I live, received no subsidies or other help from the Government.  Any subsidies it received were to build infrastructure.  While most people do not realise it, we have had a departure tax for the last ten or 15 years.  Each passenger that departed from Knock International Airport paid &euro;10 tax because they were loyal to that airport.  We saw that the money was going into the airport&rsquo;s infrastructure, which was run by the most professional administrative team in the country.</P><Col N="68"/>
        <P>The Minister should meet the people at Knock Airport and see what they have done.  They have built a huge infrastructure, including car parks, with money from emigrants to the United Kingdom.  It was the Irish diaspora who came back.  They have been hit with a &euro;10 tax.  Some of the people coming back have also been hit with a second home tax.  It is lousy and it is unfair.  All flights out of Knock are more than &euro;300, and now there is an extra &euro;10 tax.  Is this how the Government treats innovation?  Is it how it treats development by a professional and successful company?  What we need to do is to put those people in there and let them make a complete hames of it, as happened with the Dublin Airport Authority, and the Government will then bail them out.  This is how it rewards innovation and professionalism &mdash; by putting the boot in.  That is not what should happen.</P>
        <P>I used to fly to the south of the Netherlands, but because there was a tax to be paid when leaving Eindhoven, I decided, when Ryanair began to fly to Weeze Airport near Dusseldorf &mdash; it no longer does so &mdash; to fly into Dusseldorf instead and stay there, thereby denying the Dutch authorities my money.  However, the Dutch authorities had the sense to see they had made a mistake.  I ask the Minister to turn around and admit he was wrong, and we will give him credit for reversing this decision.</P>
        <P>It is worrying for rural Ireland that only 12,500 cars are available for hire this year.  I can hire a decent, mid-range car from Sixti in Europe for &euro;19.95 a day; there is nothing similar in Ireland.  If the Minister is serious about bed and breakfasts, rural tourism and regeneration of the rural economy, he should reverse this tax.  We will all say to the Minister &ldquo;Well done&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputy Mitchell on her motion.  I will speak in the context of Shannon Airport, which is the international airport for the mid-west and the western seaboard, and specifically with regard to my own constituency area of Limerick.</P>
        <P>Governments introduce taxes to collect revenue, so one would not expect a loss of revenue to result from the introduction of a tax.  The travel tax brought in &euro;160 million over a 12-month period, but there has been a loss of nearly four times that figure in revenue, along with 3,000 jobs and possibly more.  There has also been a reduction of 1.2 million in the number of passengers departing from Ireland.  It makes absolutely no sense.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance is forever giving examples of what has happened in other countries.  Why did he not mention what happened in the Netherlands, where such a tax was introduced and then, when the authorities saw the error of their ways, removed?  It is a disgrace that the only mid-west Deputy in the House at the moment is Deputy Cregan.  Not one of the relevant Ministers &mdash; the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Transport, or the new Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Hanafin &mdash; is in the Chamber.</P>

        <P>The problem is that there should be a junior Minister with specific responsibility for this area.  Neither of the two Ministers of State here tonight has specific responsibility for the travel tax.</P>
        <P>I call on the Government to consider the damage it is doing, see the error of its ways and reverse this tax.  We have a new Minister from the mid-west in the shape of Deputy Tony Killeen, who is now the Minister for Defence.  Like my colleague Deputy Breen, I ask that the new Minister exert his influence at the Cabinet table and ensure the reversal of this tax.  Deputy Killeen has a history of supporting Shannon Airport.  Now, not only does he have influence as a Deputy, he is also at the Cabinet table.  I ask him to ensure this tax is reversed because it is having a detrimental effect in terms of the number of passengers coming in.</P>
        <P>There is the issue of the tourism industry in Limerick, where there are many hotels and guesthouses.  In addition, the Government will not extend the car scrappage scheme to include short-term hire vehicles.  I ask that reason prevail.  The Government should consider the example of countries such as the Netherlands, which reversed a similar tax.  We must ensure there are no more job losses.  Ryanair has stated emphatically that the reason it is cancelling some of its routes is the travel tax.  If the Minister for Finance will reverse this tax, we should see Ryanair flights continuing from Shannon.  Fifteen routes are due to be discontinued in the next two weeks.</P>
        <P>This is an important motion for the mid-west and Limerick.  I call on the Minister for Finance to reverse this tax with immediate effect and allow the tourism industry in Limerick and the mid-west to flourish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the initiative of Deputy Mitchell in introducing this motion, which is timely.  In 2009, we lost almost 1 million visitors and &euro;1 billion in associated revenue.  Every market suffered a loss, including the domestic market, which is the backbone of so many of our rural tourism enterprises.  It is true there was a worldwide recession, but we certainly inflicted a lot of damage on ourselves as well.  The stubborn resolve of the Government to retain the &euro;10 departure tax made matters much worse than they would otherwise have been and, as we know, caused Ryanair and Aer Lingus to reduce their short-haul services into all Irish airports.</P>
        <P>One aspect of the tourism industry that worries me is the lack of cars available for rental this year.  The number has fallen from 28,000 in 2008 to 18,000 in 2009 and perhaps 12,000 &mdash; according to some &mdash; or 10,000 this year.  This will have a devastating effect on rural tourism across the country but particularly in Kerry, where there are no rail services and one needs a car to get to places such as Dingle, Kenmare, the Ring of Kerry and north Kerry.  A total of 33% of American tourists &mdash; one of the main groups of tourists in Kerry &mdash; require cars.  There is no doubt that the severe shortage of current-year models, particularly automatics, during last year&rsquo;s peak season resulted in lost business.</P>
        <P>I will mention in the short time available some initiatives that could be taken by the Government.  The Minister could extend the vehicle scrappage scheme to cover current-year ex-rentals; this was of considerable importance in the past.  He could also postpone the elimination of the VRT refund, another incentive that existed in the past.  Both of these could be done quite easily.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that the new Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Hanafin, is not here; I know she is in the Phoenix Park.  When I was in the US last week, I met officials from Tourism Ireland, who explained that in the last two years 30% of airline capacity from North America had been lost.  That is a considerable amount, encompassing Aer Lingus flights from San Francisco and Washington and the US Airways flight from Shannon Airport to Philadelphia.  US Airways is still flying to Dublin, but not to Shannon.  I also met a travel agent <Col N="70"/>in Chicago who explained to those with me, including the county manager, that fewer people are travelling to the mid-west of Ireland because there is no direct connection between Chicago and Shannon.  People were coming for short holidays of four or five days but they are no longer doing so.  I appeal to the Government to make approaches to Aer Lingus, Continental and other airlines servicing Ireland for 2011.  The challenge we have is to fill the seats in 2010 but the Minister should make direct approaches to airlines for 2011 to restore the capacity at least to what it was two years ago.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0"><Miles com="is0p6" />&ldquo;&mdash;<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />notes the unprecedented reduction in international economic growth and disturbances in financial markets over the last two years and the impact this has on all sectors of the Irish economy;</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes the positive reaction that the Government&rsquo;s prudent and decisive approach has engendered in international economic commentators and the tangible positive impact of lowering the interest cost of servicing Ireland&rsquo;s national debt;</P>
       <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes the need for &lsquo;fairness&rsquo; to be at the core of any revenue raising measures required to shore up our public finances;</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />considers that the impact of the air travel tax on tourism has been considerably overstated in the context of overall purchasing decisions by visitors; and</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />commends the actions which the Government and the Irish tourism industry are taking, both together and independently, to respond to these challenges, including:</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Deputies will see why the Government cannot accept the motion during the course of the debate.  This House is acutely aware of the challenging economic conditions in which we find ourselves.  The public finances, particularly tax receipts, have been very severely impacted by the sharp deterioration in the economic environment.  Tax revenue in 2010 is expected to be in the region of &euro;31 billion, a decline of over 30% on the level of taxes received in 2007.  Tax revenues are now back to 2003 levels and gross voted current expenditure has grown since by approximately 65%.</P>
        <P>The gap that has emerged between revenue and expenditure is unsustainable and this is why the Government has taken such significant measures to restore order to the public finances over the past 18 months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is doing so by stopping visitors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>In that regard, the 2010 budget forecast the stabilisation of the deficit in 2010, notwithstanding declining economic activity.  Many of these measures have been difficult and painful but we are committed to reducing the general Government deficit to under 3% of GDP by 2014.</P>
        <P>The strategy behind the Government&rsquo;s medium-term fiscal plan is based on two interrelated areas: inspiring confidence, both internationally and domestically, that the deterioration in the public finances has been arrested; and restoring Government expenditures and revenues to more sustainable levels, thus ensuring that debt does not rise to unsustainable levels.  The current level of borrowing is not a sustainable long-term solution as increased borrowing in turn leads to high interest costs and ultimately represents deferred taxation.</P><Col N="72"/>
        <P>Recent market developments once again underline the importance of continuing to take firm and decisive action to restore stability to the public finances.  This will in turn help return the economy to a sustainable growth path.  Over the period 2011 to 2014, it is expected that growth will return to the economy on an annual basis and that growth in tax revenues will resume.  Further adjustments in the fiscal position will be required over the coming years to restore the public finances to a sustainable position.  Challenges and difficult choices remain but we have embarked upon the correct path and that has been recognised and commended internationally.</P>
        <P>There are emerging indications that the economy is beginning to stabilise, with macroeconomic and fiscal data published in recent months generally in line with expectations.  A consensus is developing among commentators that the economy is likely to begin growing again in the second half of the year and re-establish itself on a full-year basis in 2011.  This perspective is broadly shared by the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness is improving and significant progress has been made to return the public finances to a sustainable footing.  It is notable that during these challenging times, a broad consensus has prevailed regarding the action needed to preserve our hard-earned economic and social progress.  Our economy and workforce are resilient and across the wider economy we are seeing a number of necessary adjustments which will help restore our cost competitiveness.  In particular, there is a decline in the general price level and there is evidence of an improvement in labour costs.  These developments will help position us to take advantage of an improving outlook for the international economy and we can expect to see domestic business and consumer confidence returning.  This will ultimately translate into increased economic activity and increased employment opportunities.</P>
        <P>Over the past number of decades there has been sustained investment in our greatest resource, our highly educated and skilled workforce.  This will enhance our potential to grow as future economic development will be focussed on harnessing emerging opportunities in knowledge-intensive sectors.  This is being underpinned by initiatives such as the establishment of the innovation task force and the pursuit of policies to facilitate the development of a smart and green economy.  We have also made significant investment in areas such as productive infrastructure, which will enhance our competitiveness and capacity to grow.  A high level of capital investment is being maintained and for 2010 it will be 5% of GNP, twice the EU average.</P>
        <P>The air travel tax represents just one of the measures the Government has taken in an effort to broaden the tax base and shore up the gap that has emerged between revenues and expenditure which is simply unsustainable.  The Government accepts that the airline industry, along with other industries within the transport sector and beyond, continues to go through a difficult trading period.  However, the Government does not accept that the decline in passenger numbers experienced by the airports in the State is due to the introduction of the air travel tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should ask the airlines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The difficult trading period in the airline industry arises primarily from weak world economic activity.  The present decline in air travel is an international phenomenon and as a result, aviation services are contracting on a global basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="73"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Passenger numbers through Irish airports have declined, as have those of our international counterparts, including those where there is no travel tax in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not to the same extent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>This downward trend is evident for periods prior to the introduction of the air travel tax.  Furthermore, passenger numbers for other modes of transport have also experienced broadly similar declines.  While this is not a desirable position, it is clear that the air travel tax is not the substantive cause for the decline in passenger numbers.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not unique in applying a tax on air travel.  For example, our nearest neighbour, the UK, has applied a similar tax for a number of years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">How can we, as a small island nation, be compared to the UK?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Minister of State to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The UK recently revised its air passenger duty; with the minimum rate at &pound;11 and is up to &pound;55 for long-haul flights.  Those rates will increase again later this year.  Similar taxes apply in France, Australia and New Zealand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Holland and Belgium?  They removed it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys when compared to rates in other countries.  Taking the UK as an example, a person travelling within the UK will be liable to pay the UK air passenger duty of &pound;11, or &euro;12, on each leg of the journey.  Therefore, a passenger departing from Manchester to London will be subject to the &pound;11 tax and on the return journey departing from London to Manchester that passenger will also be subject to the &pound;11 tax, giving a total tax liability of &pound;22, or around &euro;24.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>They are locations not requiring incentivisation.  There is no incentivisation here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>In Ireland, a person travelling within the State will be liable to pay &euro;2 in tax on each leg of the journey, giving a total tax liability of &euro;4.  Furthermore, the UK rates in respect of longer flights range from over four times higher to five times higher than the Irish rate.</P>
        <P>The Government acknowledges that low-cost travel has been good for Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>It should contact Michael O&rsquo;Leary and call his bluff.</P>

	<P>Allow the Minister of State to address the House without shouting him down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The pioneers in this area deserve to be commended.  However, we must, in analysing the new tax, not overplay its impact.  For illustration purposes, the House might wish to note that at present a fare from Shannon to London Stansted that is initially presented as &euro;15 with a similar &euro;15 return fare will actually cost a passenger over &euro;100 when all charges are included, excluding the air travel tax.  This assumes no luggage is checked in which would cost more.  Included in the &euro;100 is a &euro;5 credit card handling fee per flight segment.  This practice has been the subject of much criticism by consumer bodies.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="74"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation could be introduced to ban it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>In addition, there is a recently introduced on-line check-in fee of &euro;5 per flight segment.  If a person cannot check in on-line, there is a &euro;40 check-in fee per flight segment.</P>
        <P>I should point out that a person flying from any airport in the UK to Ireland is already paying, through the airlines, &pound;11, or around &euro;12, in air passenger duty to the UK Exchequer.  Airlines do not appear to have any difficulty in applying the UK air passenger duty.  In the case of long-haul flights a &euro;10 tax as a proportion of the total price of a return fare is minimal.</P>
        <P>It should be recognised that visitors to Ireland are only subject to the tax on the return journey.  The additional &euro;10, or &euro;2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditure, etc., should have only a limited effect on tourist numbers.  It must also be recognised that airlines benefit from an international tax exemption on jet fuel.  The extent of this benefit is illustrated by the example that the tax, as a percentage of the price of a litre of petrol, is currently in excess of 60%.</P>
        <P>A sense of balance must be brought to this debate.  In the past few years, exceptional growth in air travel, to and from Ireland, took place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>That growth has been killed off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>At home, strong disposable incomes and consumer confidence led some people to take several air trips per year.  It should come as no surprise, however, that in view of uncertainties in the economy generally, consumers have shown some reluctance to take or plan trips abroad.  An air trip abroad generally involves expenditure of several hundred euro.  To solely blame the introduction of a modest air travel tax of &euro;10, or &euro;2, for the reduction in passenger numbers is stretching credibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot quite understand how an airline that has complained vigorously about the &euro;10 air tax, on the basis of price sensitivity of customers, can then introduce a non-discretionary on-line check-in fee of &euro;5 per flight or &euro;10 per return flight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputies are subject to pleadings from various interest groups, some with more robust cases than others.  In the current climate, we must apply sound and balanced judgment to such pleadings.  The Government&rsquo;s view is that in this case the impact of the air travel tax has been significantly overplayed.  Do people really believe that the abolition of the air travel tax would lead to the number of tourists visiting Ireland rising significantly because the cost of coming here might decrease by &euro;10?</P>
        <P>The Government acknowledges that the tourism industry makes a vital contribution to employment, economic activity and exports.  It also contributes by encouraging social inclusion and access to labour markets.  With the support of the Government, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the tourism agencies, the tourism and hospitality sector can overcome the current challenges and make a major contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s economic renewal.</P>
        <P>The 2010 budget recognised the tourism and hospitality sector as being both critical and labour-intensive and incorporated a range of measures to renew Irish tourism.  The overall tourism services budget was increased by 2% on the 2009 figure to more than &euro;153 million in 2010.  The allocation for capital investment in tourism product development increased threefold to &euro;21 million.  This investment will be focused on completing the upgrading of some major tourism attractions, developing a select number of new visitor attractions, improving infrastructure for recreational cycling, walking and water-based activities and heritage attractions.</P>
        <P>The tourism marketing fund has a provision of &euro;44 million for 2010.  This will enable the level and value of investment in overseas marketing of Ireland, as recommended in the report of the tourism renewal group, to be maintained in real terms in 2010.  Better value for money in purchasing advertising space, currency advantages and once-off expenditure in 2009 relating to the redevelopment of Tourism Brand Ireland will ensure that there is no adverse impact from the nominal reduction in the 2010 allocation.</P>
        <P>The Government further demonstrated its commitment to tourism by including it in a range of cross-cutting measures such as the employment subsidy scheme, the work placement prog<Col N="76"/>ramme, the credit review system and incentives for investment in energy efficiency.  All of these schemes and programmes support sustainable tourism enterprises and employment.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, tourism businesses accessed the second call for applications under the employment subsidy scheme, operated under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, under which total support of &euro;65 million is available to protect vulnerable employment.  The industry will also benefit from the establishment of the credit review system for all SME sectors, including tourism.  Further specific measures that will help tourism include the changes in alcohol excise duties and VAT and the rail travel initiative aimed at senior citizens visiting Ireland from abroad.</P>
        <P>We have been experiencing the impact of an international recession of unsurpassed severity.  Every major economy &mdash; including those of our key source tourism markets &mdash; is suffering.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the position has been exacerbated by unhelpful exchange rate movements and the challenges faced by the domestic economy.  Tourism worldwide saw a significant downturn in the second half of 2008 &mdash; this continued into 2009 &mdash; as a result of the global economic slowdown and loss of consumer confidence.  There were just under 7 million overseas visitors to Ireland during 2009.  This figure represents a drop of 11.6% compared with 2008.  Outbound trips from Britain were particularly affected, with the euro-sterling exchange rate making it extremely challenging to attract visitors to Ireland and eurozone destinations generally.  The motion notes that tourists from the UK were down 16% in 2009.  However, this must be seen in context, particularly because, in the same period, visits by UK residents to Europe decreased by 16% and to North America by 20%.</P>
        <P>In common with many other businesses, tourism businesses are experiencing difficulties with regard to capacity, costs and credit supply.  These difficulties are exacerbated by lower visitor numbers.  Some of these problems must be addressed by the tourism industry.  Others are being addressed by the Government, for example, through NAMA and in the context of the supply of credit to businesses in general.  The Government will continue to work with the industry to help it manage its way through these difficulties by stimulating demand, helping to address costs or securing access to credit.</P>
        <P>Tackling the excess capacity that undoubtedly exists in the hotel sector is a complex matter and would ideally require a market response over time.  This year is again likely to be tough for the hotel sector, with further adjustments taking place as the market responds to excess room supply.  This process will gain further momentum in the coming months as more banks seek to clean their balance sheets and dispose of underperforming loans.  These market-led adjustments are necessary to restore some level of equilibrium to the hotel market.</P>
        <P>We share the concerns of business people with regard to costs relating to labour, local authority rates and energy.  That is why we took measures to, for example, secure a reduction in energy prices last year.  The fact that consumer prices in Ireland have now fallen back to 2006 levels shows we are responding flexibly to the crisis.  This has been recognised by the European Commission and international markets and has assisted in restoring confidence in the Irish economy.  The tourism industry has made great strides to reduce costs and increase productivity during the past two years.</P>
        <P>The Government has decided that the joint labour committee, JLC, wage-setting system will remain in place as a protection for low paid workers.  In that context, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009, which has passed all Stages in the Seanad and which is currently before the D&aacute;il, will modernise and strengthen the existing system for the making of employment regulation orders, EROs, and will provide for that system&rsquo;s more effective operation.  The <Col N="77"/>legislation will also strengthen the manner in which the functions delegated to JLCs are supervised by the Labour Court and ensure that a clear set of procedures and principles, within which these functions are to be discharged and made subject to Oireachtas scrutiny, is set down.</P>
        <P>When the Bill was published, the Government also announced that it proposed to introduce an additional provision &mdash; to be effected by means of a Committee Stage amendment &mdash; to facilitate the inclusion in EROs and registered employment agreements, REAs, of an inability-to-pay mechanism.  This mechanism will be similar to that provided under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and will further strengthen the relevant provisions against future court challenges and protect employment in situations where employers are faced with severe economic challenges.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Commercial rates are a form of property tax levied by local authorities on tenants of commercial properties in their administrative area.  The levying and collection of rates is a matter for individual authorities.  The determination of the annual rate on valuation, ARV, which is applied to property valuations to calculate rates, is subject to decision by the elected members of a local authority in the context of its annual budget.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is nevertheless aware of the economic pressure on local businesses and in 2009 and 2010 he specifically requested that local authorities exercise restraint in setting commercial rates to support competitiveness in the economy and to protect the interests of communities.</P>

        <P>The Government has made tough decisions but they are in the long-term interests of the economy and its people.  These decisions have involved raising additional revenues and reducing expenditure.  It is recognised by many international commentators that we are getting the balance right.  In that context the full year yield of &euro;125 million from the air tax is important.  It is, in essence, a fair tax and its impact on tourism numbers has been overplayed.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  For a long time I have believed that tourism is a vital cog in the economy of the country.  Now more than ever it can play a very significant role in the realisation and re-establishment of a level of economic activity in our country.  It can be the stimulus for which we are crying out.  It can be the capacity to attract foreign investment at a time when the foreign investment with which we were more familiar has dried up.  For that reason I welcome the appointment today of Deputy Hanafin as the new Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport.  It sends a very strong signal that a person of her calibre and stature in Cabinet has been appointed to take on such an important role at this time.</P>
        <P>May God help us if the Opposition believes that the abandonment of the &euro;10 travel tax is the solution to the problem that exists with tourism today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is part of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is that over the past five to seven years we got extremely good at selling to ourselves in many respects within the economy and none more so than in tourism.  An amount of short breaks are sold and marketed from one end of the country to the other to fill hotels developed on the basis of tax incentives, some of which I supported at the time.  However, I must say that the focus is entirely wrong if we do not return to attracting people to the country in the way we did in the past.</P><Col N="78"/>
        <P>In the past, people came here for many reasons, such as genealogy, with people from the United States coming here to trace their roots.  Unfortunately, that business is declining.  As we move from generation to generation, the link in families is much more tenuous and people are less likely to travel.  People come for fishing, scenery and many other reasons, or they did in the past.  However, they are no longer prepared to do so because we now compete with many other markets.  People have moved on from the links that were there and the product we thought we had.</P>
        <P>We have not been good at developing the next layer of product.  The future of tourism in this country depends on giving people a reason to be here.  They will not come because we are &euro;10 or &euro;5 cheaper or because we have good access.  It is about wanting to come to Ireland and developing products.  It has been shown throughout the world that people travel for product, attractions and facilities.  We must get those in place and we need money to do so.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the tax will generate enough money to develop our attractions.  We have to see tourism attractions in the same way as we see roads.  They are vital parts of our infrastructure and over the coming years we have to develop our capital programme in a way that looks to attract that tourism investment and spend from outside Ireland rather than doing what we have become very good at, which is selling to ourselves.</P>
        <P>The tax is irrelevant.  It is not the reason somebody would not come to Ireland.  When one considers the array of taxes and the cost generally, &euro;10 is an insignificant amount of money.  Over time, it will probably be removed because it will become irrelevant in the overall scheme of things because of the investment needed.  In the current environment it is necessary.  We have a significant and difficult budgetary position and therefore there is no reason we should not retain the tax.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Breen knows, the simple fact of the matter is that 80% of the passengers going through Shannon are outbound.  A person who stays at home and does not travel should not be expected to subvent a person travelling and taking money out of the country to spend it elsewhere.  Somehow over time, the idea has developed that Ryanair is delivering tourists to the mid-west and the west.  It is not.  It is taking Irish people away for short breaks and holidays.  It is getting traffic through the airport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, Michael O&rsquo;Leary clearly stated that instead of the 2 million passengers he would deliver 1.2 million passengers if the tax was removed and the charge he currently pays was reduced by half.  At present he is paying very little and half of very little is next to nothing.</P>

	<P>Like my colleague, I welcome the opportunity to say a few brief words in the House on this issue.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is coming across to me is that it is partly to blame for passenger numbers at our airports decreasing.  I cannot quantify that and I do not know the impact it is having.  However, as other speakers mentioned, at least this is an upfront charge.  It is a tax and revenue for the country.  During my time in local government if, at the time of the Estimates I was to suggest removing &euro;125 million of revenue I would immediately be asked where I would find the money to replace it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government introduced it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>In my opinion, and from what the Minister of State said, the tax will not be withdrawn at this point in time.  Therefore, it is futile to come to the House to suggest that it should when we all know it will not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>We might as well stay at home.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>We could be far more positive for our region and we should promote ideas so our region can benefit from an improved position in Shannon Airport.  I am greatly concerned about the future of Shannon Airport, as are all my colleagues in all parties in the mid-west region.</P>
        <P>Autonomy was mentioned and Cork Airport is in the same position as Shannon Airport.  There does not seem to be a huge problem or a huge issue with the travel tax or as big an issue with passenger numbers.  It is linked to the DAA, as is Shannon.  Perhaps in the coming months if the new board at Shannon Airport was to put forward a viable business plan &mdash; as I am sure it will &mdash; we could consider whether it stands up and means that the airport can go it alone and be successful.</P>
        <P>Deputy Deenihan was honest in his comments on the decrease in passenger numbers from North America.  He referred to the drop in the mid-west region.  He stated passengers were arriving in Dublin but not in Shannon.  The travel tax is not causing that issue, with all due respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not state that it does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>The travel tax is applied at all airports.  It also applies at UK and French airports.  From the figure I have seen I understand that every airport in the world is suffering a similar drop in passenger numbers.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is far more incumbent on us to ensure that we work together for our region and airport so that we have a strong gateway into the mid-west region and the west as we have always had and of which we have been very proud.  However, work in this regard must start in Shannon and nowhere else.  It must start in Shannon with the new board and all Deputies from the mid-west region must work together to ensure the restoration of Shannon Airport to its former status because with all due respect, in a manner akin to the hangar 6 issue, Mr. O&rsquo;Leary is trying to cod the people of the mid-west in respect of Shannon Airport with his sweetheart deals and is trying to get in and out for nothing.  Unfortunately, that will not work.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party will support this Opposition motion.  Both my colleague, Deputy Broughan, and I have been opposed to this tax since it was first mooted.  Despite the Taoiseach&rsquo;s shuffling of the deckchairs earlier today, it is clear that the importance of the tourism sector has never been appreciated by the present Government or any other Government led by Fianna F&aacute;il over the past 30 years.  The facts regarding tourism speak for themselves.  In 2008, tourism contributed &euro;6.3 billion in revenue, comprised 4% of the Irish economy&rsquo;s GNP and provided 128,400 jobs in the accommodation and food sector.  This was more than the number of people employed in either the agriculture or financial services sectors at the time.  It is clear that tourism is an economic lifeline nationwide and towns such as Lahinch, Dingle and Dunmore East thrive on the tourism trade.  It is an indigenous industry and the jobs generated therefrom remain in Ireland.  Tourism in Ireland means jobs and growth in areas that frequently have no major industry.  Such areas are kept thriving in a manner that would otherwise not be possible due to the Government&rsquo;s failure to implement a successful spatial strategy.</P>
        <P>In common with nearly every other sector of the economy, 2009 was a black year for the tourism sector.  The total number of overseas trips to Ireland declined for a second year in a row.  Nearly 1 million fewer people visited Ireland in 2009 than in 2008.  Our largest market, the United Kingdom, suffered the greatest fall of 16% or more than 600,000 visitors.  The decline in visitors from the rest of Europe, North America and other areas was of 8.7%, 2.4% and 12.5%, respectively.  Against this background, it beggars belief that the Government insists on retaining the air travel tax, which was first imposed with effect from 30 March 2009.  In response to Deputy Cregan&rsquo;s comments, no Member is pretending that the air travel tax is the sole cause of the fall in tourist numbers.  While a number of other factors clearly are involved, this is an additional factor that, on consideration of the figures, is quite significant and substantial and should not be ignored.  For example, the chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland indicated that the introduction of the tax would result in a net loss to the Irish economy of more than &euro;30 million on an annual basis.  A report commissioned on the air travel tax by Aer Lingus, Ryanair and Cityjet from Amsterdam Aviation Economics to which a number of Members already have referred concluded that the estimated revenue losses would be &euro;482 million, up to 3,000 jobs and 1.2 million in departing passengers in a full year of the operation of the &euro;10 departure tax. <Col N="82"/> This compares to a tax take to the Exchequer of just &euro;160 million.  Even the report from the tourism renewal group commissioned by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism stated that the abolition of the air travel tax was an urgent action for the survival of the tourism industry.</P>
        <P>When speaking earlier, the Minister of State was quite selective in the countries he chose as examples.  As he managed to ignore those countries which removed the tax, having had their fingers burned, I will balance the equation a little.  In July 2008, the Dutch Government introduced an air passenger tax targeting the collection of &euro;418 million.  A subsequent Dutch study calculated that the tax cost the Dutch economy &euro;1.6 billion.  The Dutch Government saw the light, did the sums and abolished the tax in July 2009.  Similar taxes have been removed in Belgium, Greece and Spain.  As an island nation, air transport is more important for Ireland than for any of our continental neighbours, which have integrated road and rail networks.  Which part of the arithmetic, coming from a number of disparate sources, does the Minister not understand?  All the number crunching indicates there is a serious negative impact from the travel tax.  This is the experience of other countries that have taken the sensible decision to reverse the tax.  Consequently, it is time for the Minister to wake up to reality and to set about dismantling a tax that is costing money.  Ireland is highly dependent on air travel and as an island nation our choices are pretty limited in respect of inducing people to travel here as the number of alternatives, such as luxury liners, are few and far between.  Moreover, the Government&rsquo;s own report on the sector by the tourism renewal group to which I referred earlier highlights clearly the economic short-sighted nature of the travel tax when it states</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">As an island destination . . . Ireland cannot afford to incur a competitive disadvantage that makes routes to and from Ireland less attractive for operators seeking to maximise their return.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">However, the Government continues to stick its head in the sand and to build further barriers to entry at a time when the global tourism market is shrinking.  This simply makes no sense.  Our tourism industry is under serious stress and instead of creating additional barriers for prospective tourists, it is time to consider ways of making the country more accessible.</P>
        <P>In the 21st century, the major growth markets in tourism principally will be based in Asia.  The countries concerned, including China, India and Saudi Arabia, are countries with which Ireland does not have strong cultural, historic or linguistic ties.  Consequently, for Ireland to capitalise on these potentially huge markets, it is essential to address problems surrounding travel visas for example.  It is completely unrealistic that it can take up to six months for a prospective Chinese visitor, for example, to acquire a visa to come to Ireland.  The timeframe for getting such visas must be challenged, without compromising the necessary formalities and minimising the risk of unscrupulous operators illegally gaining access to the country.  While I appreciate this primarily is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the issue must be highlighted.  How many people nowadays plan their holidays six months in advance?  The Internet now operates as the new reception desk at the travel agent and many potential travellers plan, book and change their minds within a few days or weeks.  If travellers from China who wish to come to Europe have a choice between Ireland, where they must apply six months in advance or Scotland, where the processing time is much shorter, they obviously are much more likely to choose to visit Scotland.  If the Government is serious about attracting a new cohort of potential visitors from new and emerging target countries, such artificial barriers must be scrapped.</P><Col N="83"/>
        <P>Moreover, for those same visitors to spread the good news about Ireland, there must be a commitment to and an investment in the services they require.  For example, what plans are in place to ensure that an appropriate level of language facility will be provided?  It is no longer good enough to assume that all our visitors will be satisfied to accept our limited language services, especially when they potentially can get a better quality of service elsewhere.  It should be a basic requirement and, if necessary, a targeted requirement that hotel receptionists, tour guides etc. should have a working knowledge of at least three languages other than English.  In addition, part of such a language development programme should be that languages such as Mandarin, Arabic and so on should be targeted for specific guides or hosts in Ireland in order that visitors can be matched to the appropriate language service.  We require a co-ordinated action plan on this issue to begin to target immediately this issue before it reaches a crisis point.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the addition of the free travel plan on Irish Rail to all visitors to Ireland aged over 66, which is a highly positive development, there is scope to extend this facility to all CIE services for this particular cohort of visitors.  The extension of this facility to all CIE services for visitors who are over 66, initially during off-peak periods, will provide an opportunity for a sector of the market that will be likely to spend more time in Ireland and will be encouraged to move outside the capital city, thereby bringing much-needed revenue to parts of rural Ireland.  Were the scheme limited to off-peak times, there would be no reason it could not be run on a cost-neutral basis.  I note the State already paid CIE approximately &euro;76.4 million through the Department of Social and Family Affairs in 2009.  The lack of broadband services nationwide continues to hamper the tourism industry.  It is indicative of the Government&rsquo;s lack of commitment to a real spatial strategy offering equal opportunities and services to citizens regardless of their location in the State that we have such a paltry level of broadband connectivity outside the major urban areas.  Every bed and breakfast in Ireland should be in a position to provide an on-line service to attract tourists.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The potential value of the industry is being damaged by the gaps that must be bridged, many of which are fairly basic.  I refer to better signage, an integrated ticket system, enhanced language skills, expansion of the free travel scheme and maximising our niche markets, such as golf or surfing.  None of these is particularly demanding, other than a vision to develop some form of long-term strategic development for the industry and the will to influence it.  The motion under discussion pertains specifically to the removal of the air travel tax, which has been demonstrated to be what might be described as a loss leader in many other countries.  The only difference between them and us is that we are much more dependent on air travel to attract visitors to the island of Ireland.  Second, most of these countries have seen the light and have abolished a tax that in effect is costing their economies money.  Third, we are not pretending that the air travel tax is the only issue around tourism and the problems therein.</P>
        <P>As an aside to all of the matters relating to the tourism industry, another factor that would allow more rapid action on tourism would be the facility to access information directly via the appropriate Minister in respect of legitimate questions by Deputies.  I am referring to quangos.  It is clearly not simply a question of just one Department, as this is a major issue.  Unless we can get accurate information quickly for when our constituents and members of the public need it, we will continue to damage the tourism business.</P>

	<P>I thank the Labour Party for the time allocated.  We support the general thrust of this motion and the proposal to withdraw the air travel tax.  It is true, as the statistics prove, that the tourism sector has experienced a considerable downturn during the past two years, which has had an impact in terms of business closures and job losses.  However, it is also a sector that has the potential to recover more quickly than others, given the apparent <Col N="84"/>recovery in the economies of some of the countries from which many of our visitors come.  Indeed, it has been noticeable that there seems to be, anecdotally at least, somewhat of an increase even in recent months in visitors from some European countries.</P>
        <P>We have completed a report on the sector and Senator Doherty hopes to submit it to the tourism committee.  Some of the findings in the report would indicate there is potential even in the current climate to expand, particularly if the economies of some of the countries from which many of our visitors come are ahead of us in terms of recovery.</P>
        <P>The motion also refers to the Office of Public Works and the development, or lack of development, of public sites.  This was another theme that emerged in the report.  There is significant potential not only to develop existing heritage sites, but to expand the whole area of cultural tourism.  During the Great Depression in the United States, the Democratic Administration under President Franklin Roosevelt established similar commissions as part of its efforts to stimulate growth and recovery.  Not only did it provide people with employment, but it also contributed to the creation of much of what the American people have today in collections of folk music and so on.  Such an approach would require the Government to turn its back on its current austerity measures and use its imagination to stimulate growth across a range of sectors, including tourism.</P>
        <P>Many areas of unique interest attract people to Ireland, including music, literature, sport, family and local history, folklore and so on.  It might be possible to develop these to a greater extent and to employ people locally in schemes to develop sites, create cultural centres and do family and historical research.  The evidence from places where this has been done would indicate it has been a successful approach.  Perhaps that might be something that could be done instead of closing down community schemes as is currently the case and either leaving people with nothing to do or giving young people no option but to leave the country.</P>
        <P>I would be concerned that the reference in the motion to the joint labour committee is part of a concerted effort to undermine wage levels further in what is already a low paying sector of the economy.  There has been intensive lobbying by businesses, including from within the hotel and catering sector, against the minimum wage and against the rates set by regulatory orders.  This has been successful to the extent that the Government is proposing to allow businesses to opt out of wage agreements by claiming that they cannot afford to pay people what are already fairly basic levels of pay.  This argument needs to be resisted, as does the argument that sectors like tourism are dependent on paying people low wages.</P>
        <P>Hotels did well during the good years and at a time when wage levels did not rise above the rates seen in other sectors.  Wages within the tourism sector still remain low.  The minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour is paid to a substantial number of tourism workers.  The average hourly wage is only &euro;10.57 for people with more than ten years experience and &euro;10 for those with less than four years experience.  Given the high cost of living, a 40-hour average working week makes it difficult for many workers in the sector to make ends meet.  The average weekly earnings for workers in hotels and restaurants in the last quarter of 2008 was &euro;481.38, which represented an increase from &euro;411 in the same period of 2004.  Further cuts in wages and the erosion of conditions and standards of employment would not be acceptable to most people in the sector, something that is emphasised by unions representing its workers.  Cutting wages and undermining working conditions therefore ought not to be seen as the means to help the sector to recover.</P>
        <P>The argument for cutting wages and abolishing the minimum wage is also dishonest.  As we all know, many people who have children and are earning low wages are entitled to claim the <Col N="85"/>family income supplement, FIS.  In effect, what this means is that low wage employers expect the State to subsidise them by making up the difference.  By paying FIS, the State is recognising that the minimum wage is insufficient to maintain a family in any reasonable way.  The Government is dishonest in proposing to allow employers to drive down wages when it knows it will need to pay their employees from State funds.</P>
        <P>Other cost factors could be considered.  As the motion mentions, many businesses within the tourism sector are subject to the same credit constraints affecting many other indigenous businesses, making it difficult for them either to survive the downturn or to lay the basis for recovery.  This is a considerable problem for small businesses, not least of all those involved in the tourism sector, as they are being crippled by credit constraints.  The same banks are now in the dock or rather ought to be in the dock over the manner in which they loaned out massive amounts of money to property speculators who had far less of a strategy than most of the smaller businesses now being rejected out of hand when they apply for loans and that were often rejected at the same time because the money was being squandered, leaving us in our current mess.</P>
        <P>This matter needs to be examined, not only in respect of the tourism sector but overall, especially given that the banks have benefited from the generosity of the taxpayer thanks to the measures introduced by the current Government.  Given that the State has stepped into the banking sector in this way, it ought to be able to insist that the banks extend credit to those businesses that believe they are capable of expansion.  It has been argued that the State has no role in this area, but surely if the State and the taxpayers are responsible for saving the banks and some of those to whom they lent, it ought to be able to intervene and ensure that the banks serve the public interest instead of doing as they have been up to now.</P>
        <P>The motion also refers to the issue of the so-called zombie hotels.  These are hotels that were built by property developers to avail of tax concessions and anything up to an estimated 200 of them could effectively come into public ownership after being transferred to NAMA.  Most of the hotels in question are not viable, but the fact that they exist is contributing to the vast overcapacity in the sector, estimated at 15,000 too many hotel beds, and adding to the difficulties facing the genuine operators that must compete with them.  It would be a ridiculous situation if the taxpayer was to carry what are, with a small number of exceptions, loss making hotels.  NAMA should close any loss making hotels that end up on its books and sell the properties if there is a market for them.  Alternatively, it could use the buildings for other useful purposes.  However, if that occurred, it should not be the signal to push hotel prices back up to where they were.  Hoteliers rightly make a case about the zombie hotels undermining their businesses, but some of them also forget that, when things were better and before the sharp decline in tourism, many in the sector overcharged and increased prices way above anything justified either by demand or costs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The tourism sector is one that has great potential and my county has benefited much over the years from the revenue and jobs tourism has, both from overseas and domestic visitors, brought about.  It is important to have a strategy to ensure that the sector not only survives, but that it is in a position to take advantage of any economic upturn and a potential increase in numbers travelling from abroad.</P>
        <P>As part of this strategy, some of the areas referred to in the motion need to be addressed, including access to credit.   However, I would strongly argue against any attempt to impose wage cuts on those who are already working in what is on average a low paid sector of the economy.  There also needs to be a concerted effort to increase this country&rsquo;s potential as a destination for cultural tourism. There is a huge opening in that sector if it is marketed properly and <Col N="86"/>developed.  That could also tie in with job creation within communities.  Every community in Ireland has something to say and heritage sites and local history and culture could be further developed.</P>

	<P>The Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) in Ireland is a household survey covering a broad range of issues in relation to income and living conditions. It is the official source of data on household and individual income and also provides a number of key national poverty indicators, such as the at risk of poverty rate and the consistent poverty rate.</P>
        <P>The &lsquo;at-risk-of-persistent-poverty-rate&rsquo; refers to the percentage of persons at risk of poverty in a given year and in at least 2 of the preceding 3 years. By its nature the &lsquo;at-risk-of-persistent-poverty-rate&rsquo; can only be calculated for persons in the sample for a 4 year period. As a rotational sample design is used for SILC, whereby one quarter of households are replaced each year, a small proportion of total households remain in the sample for 4 years.</P>
        <P>It is the CSO&rsquo;s view at this point that, given the small number of households, a reliable estimate of persistent poverty cannot be calculated. However, the CSO is continuing to study the problem with a view to producing a reliable estimate.</P>

The Commission&rsquo;s proposed approach includes the reduction of poverty as one of the five headline targets.</P>
        <P>Detailed analysis of the implications of the proposals under consideration is being undertaken and discussion is ongoing in the lead-up to the Spring European Council.  It is not clear at this stage therefore what will be tabled for discussion at the Spring European Council.  Ireland supports inclusion of a target to capture progress towards greater social cohesion.  The precise position will depend on what emerges from the ongoing analysis and preparatory discussions.</P>

        <P>There are 50 companies in the Mid West Region who are receiving 651 subsidies under the First Call of the Employment Subsidy Scheme. These subsidies are supporting the retention either directly or indirectly of 3,772 employees.</P>
        <P>Specifically in relation to County Clare, 26 applications were received under the First Call of the Employment Subsidy Scheme. 22 of these applications were successful and 4 companies were unsuccessful. 3 companies were unsuccessful as their applications had incomplete financial documentation and 1 company was deemed not successful by the Assessment Team, as it did not meet all of the eligibility criteria for the scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 124 together.</P>
        <P>I made a detailed Statement to the House on 28 January on this issue, as did a number of my colleagues.  An updated summary on the Government&rsquo;s responses to the Task Force recommendations is provided as follows.</P><Col N="92"/>
        <P>The Task Force completed an Interim Report which was presented to me by Mr Brosnan last July. Since then the Government has been responding to the recommendations under the various headings. Last September, I sent the Task Force a report on responses up to that time. I have now completed a broad consultation, taking account of Ministers&rsquo; budgets for 2010, with other Ministers and all relevant Divisions and agencies in my own Department, and I expect to send a further report to the Task Force very shortly.</P>
        <P>In relation to regional issues, the D&aacute;il Statements and my reports to the Task Force indicate that:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Throughout 2009, a multi-agency response to the Dell-related job losses has been taking place at two levels, providing information &amp; services to individual employees facing unemployment to facilitate them to re-train, to re-educate or to start a new business, and delivering specific initiatives to  indigenous sub-supply companies in the Mid-West to explore alternative markets, products and business opportunities.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />These measures are now being continued and expanded up to September 2011 under a successful application which I made last June under the EU&rsquo;s European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which has been approved at EU level and is being put into effect.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In relation to industrial employment in the Mid-West, 1,100 new jobs are now coming on stream in Limerick and Clare in eight projects approved by IDA and Shannon Development in 2008 and 2009. Five new High Potential start-ups were established in the Mid-West in 2009 with Enterprise Ireland support, and a &euro;26m Bank of Ireland Seed and Early Stage Equity Fund supported by Enterprise Ireland and the University of Limerick Foundation to invest in start-up and early stage companies has recently been announced.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Shannon Development has begun the further development of the National Technology Park in Limerick into a more strategic site for the attraction of industrial investment from Irish and foreign companies.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />I asked IDA in its recently published Strategy to make a renewed stronger job-creation effort in the regions, including the Mid-West, and particularly the broader Limerick area, which have recently fared less well in industrial employment.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is now carrying through arrangements to develop the Governance structures in relation to the broader Limerick area and to implement regeneration in Limerick City.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In relation to Shannon Airport, the Lynx Cargo Group and the Dublin Airport Authority are now completing an examination of the feasibility of developing a major cargo facility at the Airport.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In addition to the national Tourism Marketing Fund of &euro;44.25 million in 2010, Tourism Ireland will engage in cooperative marketing campaigns with air carriers to promote ease of access and to stimulate demand for travel to the Shannon region from key source markets. Shannon Development will continue its annual Tourism spend in the region, a support which is not available to other regions.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In relation to Roads, the region has recently seen the completion of projects such as the N18 Ennis By-pass, the N85 Western Relief Road and the N7 Southern Ring Road Phase 1. The NRA work programme will see further extensive development to the road network <Col N="93"/>in the region, including routes such as the N7, N18 and N17, the M20 to Cork, a number of link and by-pass roads close to Limerick City, as well as the Northern Ring Road.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Apart from initiatives relating specifically to the Mid-West region, Government has been responding to the economic downturn generally and has taken numerous initiatives. Many of these respond to Task Force recommendations, and the Mid-West has already benefited from them:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Our cost competitiveness and our wage competitiveness have been significantly improved.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The price of energy for industry has been significantly reduced.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Enterprise Stabilisation Fund has helped to keep viable businesses going and to keep jobs in place.  148 companies were approved for funding of &euro;59 million by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Government has supported more than 80,000 jobs under the Employment Subsidy Scheme.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /> The referral capacity for F&Aacute;S employment supports were doubled in 2009 to 147,000 places.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The recent Budget also announced a new Jobs stimulus measure for this year under the Employer Jobs PRSI Incentive Scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The recommendations of the Mid-West Task Force have been very helpful in focusing the response of Government, Departments and Agencies, both at regional and national level. I shall continue to keep the Task Force informed on the Government&rsquo;s work on matters covered in the interim recommendations. The Task Force has identified a number of issues for further study in its Final Report, which I look forward to receiving shortly.</P>

        <P>With the exception of a building in Shannon occupied by the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), none of the buildings or premises occupied by my Department and the 8 Offices of my Department is rented or leased by the Department or the Offices concerned.  In general, all buildings and premises occupied by my Department and its Offices are provided by the Office of Public Works (OPW) without any cost to the Department or the Offices.  In many of those cases the buildings/premises are rented or leased by the OPW and the information requested by the Deputy, in relation to any rental costs in 2009 and the average length of the leases for the various buildings, could only be supplied by the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>NERA&rsquo;s Shannon accommodation is held under a four-year licence agreement between the OPW and NERA on the one hand and Westpark Shannon Limited on the other.  The licence agreement commenced in February 2009.  The licence fee, which was payable by NERA in 2009, amounts to &euro;156.08 per square metre, subject to a maximum charge of &euro;32,480 per annum <Col N="94"/>(exclusive of VAT). Since 1 January 2010 the OPW has assumed responsibility for the payment of the licence fee costs for NERA&rsquo;s Shannon accommodation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 to 134, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I must advise the Deputy that the level of information requested in the questions is extremely detailed and would consume considerable resources within what is currently a very busy area of my Department to provide the information requested.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the main focus of the Redundancy Payments Section currently is to dispatch redundancy payment claims to individuals and businesses as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2007, the objective is to ensure that statutory redundancy payments, due to eligible employees on being made redundant, are made in accordance with the legislative provisions.  The legislation places the onus, in the first instance, on the employer to discharge the obligation to pay redundancy entitlement to employees.  In so doing, the employer is entitled, by virtue of pay related social contributions made to the State, to recover a 60% rebate on the amount paid out in redundancy payments to employees.</P>
        <P>In the case of liquidations/receiverships/examinerships and in cases of informal insolvency where the employer provides proof of inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to employees, the Department pays the redundancy lump sums directly to the employees from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and then seeks to recover 40% of the amount paid out as this is the company&rsquo;s share of the liability of the employees&rsquo; statutory payment.</P><Col N="97"/>
        <P>In circumstances where proof of inability to pay on the part of the employer is not provided, or the employer refuses to pay the redundancy lump sum payments to employees, it is the case that the Department refers those employees to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) to obtain a determination of their right and entitlement to a redundancy lump sum.  Where a positive determination is obtained from the EAT, this enables the Department to pay the employees directly from the SIF and the Department then endeavours to recover from the employer the amount paid out from the Fund &mdash; 40% in the case of employers where proof of inability to pay could not be provided and, in the case of employers who refused to pay the redundancy entitlements in the first instance, the Department seeks to recover to the SIF 100% of the amount paid out.</P>
        <P>Under Section 43 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 (as amended) amounts owing to the Fund are recoverable as debts due to the State and, without prejudice to any other remedy, may be recovered by the Minister as a debt under statute in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The Minister&rsquo;s claim has preferential status under Section 42 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 (as amended).</P>
        <P>The Department does not collate information regarding the number of cases in which it has advised employees to have recourse to the EAT owing to either insufficient proof of inability to pay on the part of the employer or, refusal by the employer to pay the entitlements of employees.</P>
        <P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal is an independent, quasi-judicial body under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It deals with claims under 18 different pieces of legislation.  I am informed that it is not currently possible to disaggregate the numbers of claims received under the different pieces of legislation &mdash; it is possible to disaggregate once the claims are dealt with. Overall, the numbers of claims to the Tribunal have shown a marked increase in the last two years in particular, from 3,173 in 2007 to 5,457 in 2008, and rising to 9,458 in 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The degree of increase in the number of claims received has naturally placed considerable pressure on case processing timeframes before the EAT. However, a number of steps have been taken to relieve this pressure.  These include increasing the allocation of administrative resources to the Tribunal in the past two years, increasing the numberii of sittings per day, to a total of 924 in 2007, 1,304 in 2008, up to a total of 1,437 in 2009.</P>
        <P>Efficiencies introduced in the Tribunal have increased the rate of throughput of claims from 2,807 in 2007 to 4,007 in 2008 and rising to 4,680 in 2009.  Included in these figures are claims dealt with under the Redundancy Payments Acts as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">2007 &mdash;   546</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">2008 &mdash; 1,038</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">2009 &mdash; 1,420.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, I have increased the pool of people available to sit on Tribunal Hearings by 9.  Work is underway in relation to the IT system operated by the Tribunal in order to upgrade it and consideration is being given to the possible installation of a new IT system. The situation in the Tribunal is under constant review and further action will be taken as necessary within the constraints that exist in relation to resources.</P>
        <P>The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate applications submitted by post from June 2009 and those filed online from August 2009, so that the <Col N="98"/>waiting time is approximately 6 to 8 months depending on the manner of filing the application.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from August 2009.  For the years 2005 to early 2008 the Department&rsquo;s target for processing claims was 6 weeks for online claims and 10 weeks for manual claims submitted by post.  Since then the processing times have extended continually due to the influx of redundancy claims resulting from the economic downturn.</P>
        <P>My Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008, and made corresponding payments totalling &euro;336m which results in average weekly payments to the value of &euro;6.5m being issued.   In the period 2007-2009, the level of new claims lodged with my Department has increased cumulatively by 200%.   This contrasts with the previous two-year period 2005-2007 in which period the increase in new claims lodged was just 10%.</P>
        <P>Efforts have been made by the T&aacute;naiste and myself to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.</P>
        <P>Measures already taken include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 52.5;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The T&aacute;naiste and I are monitoring closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and it is clear that additional measures are required to help reduce the backlog of claims which currently stands in excess of 39,000.  The Department is currently actively engaged in efforts to secure up to 16 additional staff resources deployed to the area in the first half of 2010.</P>
        <P>Table 1 sets out the number of statutory redundancy applications received for the years 2005 to 2009.</P>
        <P>Tables 2 and 3 set out the total amount paid by the Department out of the Social Insurance Fund in respect of redundancy claims for the years 2005-2009.</P><Col N="99"/>
        <P Just="Left">In the years 2005 to 2009, the Department has been successful in recovering to the Social Insurance Fund amounts of &euro;2.2m, &euro;0.4m,  &euro;0.7m, &euro;0.9m and &euro;3.6m respectively as shown in Table 4.</P>
        <P>The cumulative debt outstanding which the Department is seeking to recover to the Social Insurance Fund as it stood at each year end is &euro;24.9m, &euro;31.1m, &euro;37.7m, &euro;48.5m and &euro;78.7m respectively as shown in Table 5.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.</P>
        <P>Cloud computing is one of the most important transformations in the IT industry since the adoption of the Internet, as it facilitates computing-on-demand rather than computing-on-premise. This enables users to use just as much computing power as they need and to pay for it according to their demand. As such it enables convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, and services) that can be rapidly deployed with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.</P>
        <P>It is clear from both the Government&rsquo;s Smart Economy policy and the recently published Innovation Taskforce report that internet-based technologies, including cloud computing, will underpin the development and further growth of the IT sector here and assist Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and growth. Internet-based technologies and business models are a key feature of innovation and productivity and cloud computing in particular will enable companies to control their IT costs by reducing expenditure on IT equipment and infrastructure in favour of using hosted facilities.</P>
        <P>Business opportunities are being driven by existing communications-intensive sectors, which includes cloud computing, and Ireland is already taking a lead in a number of areas in this regard, supported through the efforts of the enterprise development agencies.</P>
        <P>For example, IDA Ireland has identified data centres and ecosystem services around cloud computing as an important growth area for Ireland, leveraging off the significant investments already made here by leading ICT multinationals and IDA clients such as IBM, Hewlett Packard and Intel.  The IDA&rsquo;s aim is to win further investments that result from convergence, enabled by technologies such as cloud computing. New collaborations between existing clients in different sectors and between those clients and other firms and/or universities in Ireland are increasing and will be a source of jobs in the next five years.</P><Col N="101"/>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for Development of the Software Sector features transition programmes to assist software companies to change their business models to take advantage of Cloud computing.  These programmes will address a range of issues including data protection, confidentiality and security.</P>
        <P>There are a number of very significant research groups in the higher education institutions, either currently or previously funded by Science Foundation Ireland, which are working in the cloud computing area, and examples include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Computer Architecture and Grid Research Group at Trinity College Dublin;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Hamilton Institute at NUI Maynooth;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI) &mdash; a SFI Centre for Science, Engineering and Technology based at NUI Galway.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition to currently funded groups, Science Foundation Ireland also has a number of additional research proposals currently under review in the cloud/data centre area. These investments will help underpin the development of cloud computing in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Investment in Cloud computing is a significant opportunity for the private sector where the significant business potential of providing services in this area is recognised. The Government and enterprise development agencies can, and are, providing significant assistance in realising the potential of cloud computing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 provides that an employee shall not work more than an average of 48 hours a week averaged generally over a 4 month reference period.  In relation to employees whose work is subject to seasonality or to a foreseeable surge in activity, or where employees are directly involved in ensuring continuity of service or production, the reference period is 6 months.  The reference period can be extended up to 12 months in respect of employees who have entered into a collective agreement providing for such a reference period and, provided the collective agreement is approved by the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>Night workers shall not work more than an average of 48 hours a week averaged over a 2 month period or longer if a collective agreement is approved by the Labour Court.  However, night workers whose work involves special hazards or heavy physical or mental strain shall not work more than a total of 48 hours a week.</P>
        <P>The 1997 Act also provides that an employee is entitled to a break of 15 minutes after working more than four and a half hours and a further break of 15 minutes after working more than six hours.  If a break is not taken after more than four and a half hours work, a 30 minute break may be taken after more than six hours work.</P>
        <P>The Act provides that an employee is entitled to eleven consecutive hours rest in a twenty four hour period and thirty five consecutive hours rest in a seven day period.  If an employee <Col N="102"/>does not receive the thirty five hour rest period in seven days he/she is entitled to a rest period of fifty nine consecutive hours in 14 days.</P>
        <P>These terms apply to a worker or employee under a single contract of employment with his/her employer, to include a person who is working in two different places of employment for such employer.  As regards a worker who works under more than one contract of employment for a single employer, section 15(1) of the 1997 Act provides that an employer shall not permit an employee to work more than an average of 48 hours in each period of seven days.  As regards a worker who works under more than one contract of employment for more than one employer, Section 33 of the 1997 Act provides that the aggregate of the hours he or she works for both employers cannot exceed an average of 48 hours per week.</P>

        <Quest> if the main purpose of the Shareholders Rights Directive 2007/36/EC Regulations 2009 signed on 6 August 2009 is to enhance the rights of shareholders; if these enhanced rights include access to possible election as a director of financial institution at an AGM or EGM; if covered institutions are subject to this directive; and if covered institutions are adhering to this directive, referring in particular to a bank (details supplied). </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the Regulations referred to by the Deputy is to implement the Shareholders&rsquo; Rights Directive on the exercise of certain rights attaching to voting shares in relation to general meetings of listed companies. The Regulations, transposed as S.I. 316 of 2009, apply to companies whose registered office is in the State and whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating within a Member State. In practice this means companies listed and trading on the Main Market of the Irish Stock Exchange as well as any company trading on a regulated market in another Member State having its registered office in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The main provisions of the Regulations are as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Provides for shareholder participation across borders without the need to physically attend meetings, notably through the exercise of voting rights electronically;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Obliges companies to answer shareholders&rsquo; questions at general meetings;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Obliges companies to publish documents and information regarding a general meeting on their website, including the result of votes taken;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Allows shareholders representing at least 5% of the voting shares in a company the right to call a general meeting (previously a holding of 10% was required);</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Allows shareholders holding 3% of the issued share capital and representing at least 3% of the voting shares in a company the right to put items on the agenda and table draft resolutions for an annual general meeting; and</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Strengthens shareholders&rsquo; rights in relation to the appointment of proxies at general meetings.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There is no provision either in the Directive or the transposing Regulations providing specifically for access to possible election as a Director of a Financial Institution.</P>
        <P>It is assumed that the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to covered institutions refers to those institutions covered by the Bank Guarantee Scheme. The Regulations only apply to the two main banks.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) is responsible for enforcement of the Regulations. If the Deputy is aware of any instances of non-compliance on the part of the institutions subject to the Regulations, he should communicate these to the Director of Corporate Enforcement who is independent in the exercise of his statutory functions.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Primary responsibility in relation to the marketing, promotion and labelling of food products lies with my colleagues the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries and the Minister for Health and Children and the relevant agencies operating under their auspices and I have no direct function in relation to such matters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Insofar as my own area of responsibility is concerned, the Consumer Protection Act 2007 includes specific provisions in relation to the provision of information to consumers in the course of commercial transactions. Specifically the Act provides that the provision of false information in relation to the geographical or commercial origin of a product and where that information would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision that the average consumer would not otherwise make that such a practice is a misleading commercial practice. Traders who engage in misleading commercial practices commit an offence and are liable on conviction on indictment or on summary conviction, as the case may be, to the fines and penalties provided for under the Act.</P>
        <P>Evidence of traders engaging in misleading commercial practices should be brought to the attention of the National Consumer Agency, which is the body responsible for the enforcement of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 to 150, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has already put the following measures in place to assist redundant apprentices:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">1. F&Aacute;S has put in place an interim measure whereby redundant apprentices may progress to the next off-the-job training phase of their apprenticeship, in line with current scheduling criteria.  In 2009, over 2,000 redundant apprentices were provided with off-the-job training. To date in 2010, 1,041 redundant apprentices commenced off-the-job training in January 2010, and 1,008 are currently being scheduled to commence in April 2010 Phase 4 and Phase 6 off-the-job training in the Institutes of Technology and Colleges of Further Education</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">2. In 2009, F&Aacute;S introduced a temporary <i>Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme</i> for apprentices made redundant in the Construction Industry.  Over 460 redundant apprentices completed Phase 3, 5 and 7 on-the-job training and assessments with employers under this Scheme in 2009.  A new <i>Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme</i> which will replace the Rotation Scheme in 2010, is under development and this will assist redundant apprentices to complete the on-the-job training of their apprenticeships with a F&Aacute;S approved employer.  The Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme is expected to provide 750 places for redundant apprentices to commence on-the-job training at Phase 3 and Phase 5 during 2010 based on applications from eligible employers. A budget of &euro;3.875m has been allocated to the scheme.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">3. A <i>joint ESB Networks / F&Aacute;S programme</i> commenced in March 2009 where on-the-job training with ESB Networks is provided to eligible redundant apprentices at Phases 5 and 7 of their apprenticeship.  This programme will provide up to 400 places over a period of 18 months and is funded by ESB Networks. To date, 184 redundant apprentices have completed training, 106 are currently in training, and further placements will take place during 2010.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">4. F&Aacute;S has also developed Phase 7-equivalent assessments for redundant apprentices at the final phase of their apprenticeship in the trades of Carpentry &amp; Joinery, Electrical, Plumbing, Brick &amp; Stonelaying and Plastering.  Redundant Apprentices are being scheduled to the assessments events in accordance with the scheduling calendar.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">5. Redundant apprentices registered for 4 years who have successfully completed all Phases 1-7 of their apprenticeship, but have not yet completed the required 4 years in employment as an apprentice in the specified trade, will be contacted by F&Aacute;S to submit a portfolio of evidence under Recognition of Prior Learning for consideration by the National Apprenticeship Advisory Sub-committee for the award of the Advanced Craft Certificate.</P><Col N="108"/>
        <P LI="1" el="5">6. Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing trade-related specific skills training courses to enhance their employable skills.  They may also avail of the range of trade-related evening courses available in F&Aacute;S Training Centres.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In response to Question Number 149, the numbers and apprenticeship types of those apprentices within six to 12 months of completion of their apprenticeship without a job placement are set out in the <i>Appendix</i>.</P>
        <P>In response to Question Number 150, the number of apprentices recorded as redundant in 2008 and who currently have the same status / phase is 645.</P>

	<P>The EGF application process from initiation to final decision is a lengthy procedure involving not just the European Commission but also the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  In the case of the EGF application in relation to redundant workers at the DELL plant in Co. Limerick the approval process took some six months.  Strict eligibility criteria apply and there is no guarantee of success if a sustainable case for EGF assistance cannot be made in support of a Member State&rsquo;s application.  My Department is seeking to ensure that such a robust case is made and sustained. In this context Department officials are currently preparing a response to a request from the European Commission for further information in relation to the SR Technics application and it is hoped to complete this process in the next couple of weeks.  In the interim State agencies such as FAS and Enterprise Ireland have made, and continue to make, the full range of their employment, training, guidance and advisory services available to all workers made redundant at S R Technics. </P>
        <P>Furthermore, with a view to ascertaining those interventions, including in further and third level education, that redundant SR Technics workers might avail of in the event of a successful EGF application being made, an information event was held by a wide range of service providers in Dublin Airport in December 2009.  I know that the full range of education programmes provided by the VEC and third level sector are also available to redundant SR Technics workers and that the education sector is also working to develop additional upskilling responses in anticipation of the approval of the EGF application.  However, while every effort is being made to ensure such programmes can proceed as soon as possible, the further progression of any interventions to be funded specifically by the EGF must await the completion of the EGF application process.  In relation to the length of time that EGF funding is available the timeframe permitted for eligible expenditure under the Fund is 24 months from the date of submission of an application, or from the date of commencement of relevant measures provided this is no later than 3 months after the application&rsquo;s submission.</P>

	<P>There are currently 260 unemployed apprentices registered in Co. Wexford.  F&Aacute;S has already put the following measures in place to assist redundant apprentices:</P>
<P el="5">1. F&Aacute;S has put in place an interim measure whereby redundant apprentices may progress to the next off-the-job training phase of their apprenticeship, in line with current scheduling criteria.  In 2009, over 2,000 redundant apprentices were provided with off-the-job training.  To date in 2010, 1,041 redundant apprentices commenced off-the-job training in January 2010, and 1,008 are currently being scheduled to commence in April 2010 Phase 4 and Phase 6 off-the-job training in the Institutes of Technology and Colleges of Further Education.</P>
<P el="5">2. In 2009, F&Aacute;S introduced a temporary <i>Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme</i> for apprentices made redundant in the Construction Industry.  Over 460 redundant apprentices completed Phase 3, 5 and 7 on-the-job training and assessments with employers under this Scheme in 2009.  A new <i>Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme</i> which will replace the Rotation Scheme in 2010, is under development and this will assist redundant apprentices to complete the on-the-job training of their apprenticeship with a F&Aacute;S approved employer.</P>
<P el="5">3. A <i>joint ESB Networks / F&Aacute;S programme</i> commenced in March 2009 where on-the-job training with ESB Networks is provided to eligible redundant apprentices at Phases 5 and 7 of their apprenticeship.  This programme will provide up to 400 places over a period of 18 months and is funded by ESB Networks.  To date, 184 redundant apprentices have completed training, 106 are currently in training, and further placements will take place during 2010.</P>
<P el="5">4. F&Aacute;S and the Institutes of Technology have agreed the <i>PP5 programme</i> for redundant apprentices who have successfully completed Phases 1-4 of their apprenticeship and where an on or off-the-job training opportunity is not currently available to them.  The programme has both a Construction Stream and an Engineering Stream, with a number of core skills modules related to apprenticeship and a number of electives in specific skills.  The programme provides apprentices with a Level 5 FETAC award and allows for access and transfer of credits to other post-apprenticeship programmes.  The Institutes of Technology are currently providing training to eligible redundant apprentices who responded to invitations issued in January 2010 by the Institutes of Technology providing the programme.</P>
<P el="5">5. F&Aacute;S has also developed Phase 7-equivalent assessments for redundant apprentices at the final phase of their apprenticeship in the trades of Carpentry &amp; Joinery, Electrical, Plumbing, Brick &amp; Stonelaying and Plastering.  Redundant Apprentices are being scheduled to the assessments events in accordance with the scheduling calendar.</P>
<P el="5">6. Redundant apprentices registered for 4 years who have successfully completed all Phases 1-7 of their apprenticeships, but have not yet completed the required 4 years in employment as an apprentice in the specified trade, will be contacted by F&Aacute;S to submit a portfolio of evidence under Recognition of Prior Learning for consideration by the National Apprenticeship Advisory Sub-committee for the award of the Advanced Craft Certificate.</P>
<P el="5">7. Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing trade-related specific skills training courses to enhance their employable skills.  They may also avail of the range of trade-related evening courses available in F&Aacute;S Training Centres. FAS has advised that where <Col N="111"/>the employment of a F&Aacute;S registered apprentice has been terminated due to insufficient work being available, he/she should:</P> <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Inform F&Aacute;S Services to Business immediately of his/her redundant status Register with the local F&Aacute;S Employment Services Office for assistance in securing new employment to enable him/her to continue their apprenticeship training.</P>
<P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Access information regarding employment vacancies by telephoning F&Aacute;S Jobs Ireland at Freephone 1 800 611 116 or on the F&Aacute;S Website (www.fas.ie) Keep F&Aacute;S Services to Business informed of all details relating to his/her apprenticeship employment with a F&Aacute;S approved employer so that this time may be credited in calculating the finish date of his/her apprenticeship.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">It is important to point out that the onus is on redundant apprentices themselves to inform F&Aacute;S Services to Business immediately of his/her redundant status and register with their local F&Aacute;S Employment Services Office.  Otherwise, the redundant apprentice may lose out on invaluable assistance in securing new employment which would enable him/her to continue their apprenticeship training. </P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received two rebate claims from the company concerned in February, 2009.  Further information was requested in relation to the claims submitted and, while a reply was received which enabled one of the claims to be processed and paid, the information requested in respect of the second employee is still, according to my Department&rsquo;s records, outstanding.  Upon receipt of the outstanding information in relation to the second employee and, providing it is in order, the claim will be processed.   </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157, 161,162 and 163 together.</P>
        <P>In October 2009 Aer Lingus announced details of a cost savings programme aimed at reducing operating costs by &euro;97 million, comprising staff savings of &euro;74 million and non-staff cost savings of &euro;23 million.  Following four months of intense negotiation between Aer Lingus management and Unions, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, the resulting <Col N="113"/>joint agreements were put to Aer Lingus staff with a recommendation for acceptance by each of the respective unions.  The results of the ballots were that the plan was accepted by four out of the five unions involved. Cabin crew rejected the plan by a 2:1 majority.  Aer Lingus subsequently announced their plans to achieve the necessary cost savings.</P>
        <P>As a result of further discussions at the Labour Relations Commission on 19 March, during which clarifications on the cost saving plan were given, cabin crew will ballot again on the restructuring package in the coming days.  The restructuring process within Aer Lingus is therefore the subject of continuing dialogue with the trade unions representing the company&rsquo;s employees.  I am satisfied that there is an adequate legal framework in this country governing restructuring arrangements at company level in the form of legislation covering collective redundancies and legislation covering information and consultation requirements.</P>
        <P>In relation to the issue of redundancy and eligibility for redundancy payments, I should point out that redundancy is a matter of fact that occurs after the event of termination of employment.  Qualification for an entitlement to the payment of statutory redundancy under the Redundancy Acts cannot be made until the full facts of the situation are known, after the event.  When presented with redundancy claims for payment, the Department will have regard to the legislative provisions governing the eligibility of any such claims and can, if necessary, have the matter referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for a decision on any claims that might actually be made.</P>
        <P>The Government is satisfied, from all of the information available to it, that a major restructuring of the Group&rsquo;s cost base is essential if Aer Lingus is to return to profitability and growth. The cost base of Aer Lingus is seriously out of line with that of its competitors.  Airlines throughout the world are either rationalising or going out of business as a result of the global economic downturn.  The Government want to see a strong viable Aer Lingus in the future.  The cornerstones of Government aviation policy are competitiveness and connectivity.  A viable Aer Lingus is key to ensuring the achievement of these objectives.</P>

	<P>The County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) have primary responsibility for the delivery of State support to the indigenous micro-enterprise sector i.e. businesses which employ 10 or less workers.  The CEBs, through both financial and non-financial assistance, support the sector in the start-up and expansion phases and facilitate entrepreneurial activity at local level.  There are three types of grant-aid available from the CEBs:</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="mdash66" />Priming Grants;</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="mdash66" />Business Expansion Grants;</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="mdash66" /> Feasibility/Innovation Grants.</P>
<P el="6" FLI="0">A Priming Grant is a start-up grant available to micro enterprises within the first 18 months of start-up.  A Business Expansion/Development Grant is available to further grow a micro enterprise while a Feasibility/Innovation Grant is available to assist micro-enterprises with the cost of pre-start up studies carried out to assess demand for a new product or service, the appropriateness of funding plans and the general viability of the venture.  The criteria under which funding is available from the CEBs is based on factors such as the sector of the economy <Col N="115"/>in which an enterprise is operating or intends to operate and the size or proposed size of the enterprise.</P>

<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />the enterprise must be in the commercial sphere</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />the enterprise must demonstrate a market for the product/service</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />the enterprise must have a capacity for growth and new job creation</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />the enterprise must not employ more than 10 people</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />priority must be given to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector which can develop into strong export entities</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />it is considered inappropriate to support businesses in sectors such as retail, personal services, professional services and construction etc as these generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight and/or displacement within a local area.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="6">While the range of expenditure which is regarded as eligible expenditure for grant-aid excludes the purchase of mobile assets such as commercial vehicles it is, none the less, quite a considerable range including the following;</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />Capital items including fit out of workspace, office equipment, machinery, computer costs</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />Salary costs for first year of employment</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />Rental/Accommodation costs for first year of the project</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />Utility costs including installation costs for telephone &amp; broadband</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />Marketing costs including packaging, brochures, trade fairs, website design and development, patent fees and other marketing initiatives</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />Consultancy costs including design fees, architect, accountant and legal fees</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />Business training costs for key Personnel central to the growth of the business</P>
<P el="6"><Miles com="bull66" />Some miscellaneous costs relating specifically to Feasibility/Innovation Grants.</P>
<P FLI="0">I am confident that the current mix of grant types, the criteria underlying these grant types, and the broad range of eligible expenditure ensures that a significant number of viable start-up and existing micro-enterprises can access significant levels of financial assistance from the CEBs.</P>

These projections were based on a set of assumptions which ensured comparability between all EU Member States.  The  reason for the different results in these two publications is that pension projections included in the <i>National Pensions Framework</i> were based on a different set of assumptions and covered a different reference period to those in the <i>2009 Ageing Repor</i>t. Notwithstanding these differences, however, both sets of projections show the same picture of continuously increasing pension costs over the long term. The Government&rsquo;s decision to set out radical and wide-scale reform of the Irish pension system was taken in light of this long-term outlook.</P>

	<P>My Department made an application to the EU Commission on 27th January 2010 for funding under the EU Solidarity Fund based on estimates of damage received from Departments and local authorities. The application was formally acknowledged by the Commission on 24 February 2010. The EU Solidarity Fund does not fund full reconstruction nor does it fund prevention works. It funds emergency operations to allow a rapid return to normal living conditions.</P>
        <P>A regional application was made as the estimate of the extent of the damage does not meet the Solidarity Fund&rsquo;s threshold of 0.6% of GNI or &euro;935.5m for a national disaster. There are specific criteria which must be met to ensure a successful regional application to the EU Solidarity Fund. These criteria include the majority of the population of the region being affected by the disaster and serious and long lasting effects on the region&rsquo;s economic stability and living conditions.  My Department continues to work with the Commission on finalising the costs underpinning the application.  </P>

        <QRef>[12235/10] </QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that as part of the debate on the passage of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) legislation, I undertook, with cross party support, to conduct an expressions of interest process and consultation with party leaders to seek appointments to the Board. </P>
        <P>As I indicated when the appointments were made on 22 December 2009 over 800 applications were received and considered.  With the assistance of the Public Appointments Service and a former Secretary General of my Department these applications were reduced to 36 names from which, in addition to nominees which were submitted outside of this process, the final appointment of 7 members to the Board were made.  The very nature of the expression of interest process means it is not comparable to a standard recruitment competition where the interested candidature would be necessarily more restrictive.  As with any competition it is the merit of each individual application that determines if it is successful.</P>
        <P>I revealed in an answer to a Parliamentary Question of 10 March 2010 the details of the remuneration of the Board members.  They are as follows: Chairperson &mdash; all inclusive fee of &euro;170,000 per annum on the understanding that the incumbent is available without restriction.  Chairperson of Credit Committee &mdash; all inclusive fee of &euro;150,000 per annum on the understanding that the incumbent works no less than 3 to 4 days a week.  Ordinary Board Members (5 remaining board members) &mdash; fee of &euro;50,000 per annum. Chair of other Committees &mdash; fee of &euro;10,000 per annum in addition to Ordinary Board Member fee subject to a maximum of one per member.</P>
        <P>The total cost in 2010 is therefore likely to be &euro;470,000 and an additional amount dependent upon how many sub-committees are established by the Board of NAMA.  However, given that board members can receive a maximum of one fee for Chairing another Committee and given the fact that neither the Chair nor the Chair of the credit Committee can receive this extra fee as their main fee is all-inclusive the maximum extra cost of payments to Chairs of other Committees is &euro;50,000.</P>
        <P>I further indicated that in setting the fees account was taken of the critical importance of the work to be undertaken by the Board and the fact that its workload will be excessive by normal standards in the first year of operation. I also indicated that I intended to review the fees after a year.  The question of extending the application of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 to NAMA was discussed a number of times during the passage of the NAMA Bill 2009 through the houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Much of the information which NAMA will process in its day-to-day operations will be confidential commercial information attaching to the loan assets it acquires.  The commercial and financial risks that would arise in connection with the disclosure of such information pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 1997 would not be in the interests of NAMA, the Sate or the public.  Such confidential third party information would not be released under the Freedom of Information Act and applying the FOI Act to it simply introduces extra bureaucracy with no additional transparency.  There are already a range of other provisions in the Act which will ensure appropriate transparency and accountability of NAMA.  Accordingly, I regarded <Col N="120"/>such proposals as inappropriate and I therefore did not accept these amendments to the Bill and I stand by that decision and the rationale for it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the question of conflicts of interest I would like to bring to the attention of the Deputy the fact that two of the criteria used in short listing were that the applicant was not currently working in any potential NAMA institution and secondly that there were no conflicts of interest apparent from the application.  Furthermore the NAMA Act 2009 provides that all members of the board must furnish a valid tax clearance certificate within 3 months of appointment to the Board and I can confirm that this has been complied with for all current members of the Board.</P>
        <P>Section 30 of the NAMA Act 2009 provides for matters relating to disclosure of interests by the Board members.  Among other things it provides that if Board members do not adequately disclose interests and act in a hands-off manner where interests have been disclosed, they may be removed from office by the Minister.  Section 31 further provides that NAMA shall keep a register of members&rsquo; interests and update it at the beginning of each year.</P>

	<P>I announced in Budget 2010 that, as part of the reform of the public service pension structure, I will review the current arrangements applying in the case of post-retirement pension increases and in this context will consider linking pensions to increases in the cost of living.  The recent special report by the Comptroller and Auditor General estimated that the present actuarial cost of public service pensions is 108 billion euro.  A change to a CPI basis for post-retirement increases would reduce that cost to 87 billion, a reduction of 20 per cent. </P>
        <P>The cost implications of public service pensions  have been borne out by successive recent studies including the <i>National Pensions Review</i> (2005), the <i>Green Paper on Pensions</i> (2007) and the<i> Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on Public Service Pensions</i> (2009). The C&amp;AG&rsquo;s report is especially telling as to the cost consequences if action is not taken. It estimates gross public service pension payments this year at 1.6% of GNP, and projects that this will rise to 2.4% by 2023, driven by fast growth in pensioner numbers.  Thereafter costs are seen stabilizing at about 2.5% of GNP in the period 2023-2038, before accelerating again to reach 3.6% of GNP in 2058.</P>
        <P>In this context, as the Deputy will be aware, the Government recently published a new National Pension Policy Framework (2010) to deal with these and other critical pension issues. The public service pension changes now being considered  are within the scope of and firmly supportive of the broader reforms featuring in the framework.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together. </P>
        <P>In August 2004 under the Administrative Sanctions Procedure (ASP), the Financial Regulator was given the power to impose Administrative sanctions on &ldquo;regulated financial service providers&rdquo; and on &ldquo;persons concerned in the management of those entities&rdquo; for breaches of prescribed contraventions of certain Designated Acts and Statutory Instruments.</P>
        <P>Following a public consultation, in  October 2005 the Financial Regulator adopted a general policy of dealing with cases where prescribed contraventions were also potentially criminal offences, under the ASP, instead of bringing summary prosecutions.  This is in light of the limited penalties available pursuant to summary criminal prosecutions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2005 the Financial Regulator was also given additional sanctioning powers under the Market Abuse (Directive 2003/6/EC) Regulations  2005 (the Market Abuse ASP) (to impose sanctions on various entities) and under S.I. No. 324 of 2005 &mdash; Prospectus (Directive 2003/71/EC) Regulations 2005. In 2007 the Financial Regulator was given further sanctioning powers under S.I. No. 277 of 2007 &mdash; Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007.  I am informed that to date the Financial Regulator has imposed Fines amounting to &euro;7,372,500, 7 Disqualifications ranging from 1 to 5 years and 19 Reprimands. Details of all sanctions in any given year are published annually in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Annual Report.  The sanctions imposed to date are broken down as follows:</P>
<P el="10"><i>2006</i></P>
<P el="0" Just="Left">Sanctions were imposed under the ASP on 2 regulated financial service providers and upon 3 persons concerned in the management of those entities.  These resulted in 3 individuals being disqualified from being persons concerned in the management of regulated financial services provider for a specified period [5 years and 18 months].</P>
<P el="10"><i>2007</i></P>
<P el="0">Sanctions were imposed under the ASP on 4 regulated financial service providers.  These resulted in: 3 Reprimands being imposed; and 1 Disqualification  for a specified period [2 Years].</P>
        <P Just="Left">Market Abuse ASP Procedure: Sanctions were imposed upon 1 Company and 1 individual.  These resulted in a fine of &euro;5,000.</P>
<P el="10"><i>2008</i></P>
<P el="0" Just="Left">Sanctions were imposed under the ASP on 9 regulated financial service providers and upon 5 persons concerned in the management of those entities.  These resulted in: 10 Fines being imposed which totalled &euro;3.695 million, 9 Reprimands and 2 Disqualifications for specified periods [5 years and 1 year]</P>
        <P Just="Left">Market Abuse Administrative Sanction Procedure: Sanctions were imposed upon 1 Company. These resulted in a fine of &euro;10,000.</P><Col N="122"/>
<P><i>2009</i></P>
<P el="0" Just="Left">Sanctions were imposed under the ASP on 10 regulated financial service providers and upon 1 person concerned in the management of those entities.  These resulted in: 6 Fines being imposed which totalled &euro;3,672,500, 8 Reprimands and 1 Disqualification for a specified period [2 years].</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that there are a number of offences contained within the Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2004. I have asked my officials to compile the relevant information. I will write directly to the Deputy when the information comes to hand.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the Central Bank of Ireland Act 1942 (as amended), the employment of staff in the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority  (other than the Registrar of Credit Unions and the Chief Executive of the Authority) is a matter solely for the Board of the Bank, the Regulatory Authority and the Governor and is not a matter in which I have a role. </P>
        <P>However, I am informed by the Authority that its approved manpower complement for 2010 is some 533.  Of this, some 41 posts (8%) are at senior management level; some 349 posts(65%) are at senior officer level and some 143 posts (27%) are at clerical/administrative support level. There are about 160 vacant posts.</P>
        <P>In March 2009, 81% of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s staff held a minimum of a third level qualification or higher; 44% had qualifications at primary or master degree level; 21% held a professional accounting, legal or actuarial qualification; 16% held other qualifications, including Certificates and Diplomas, such as the Qualified Financial Advisor Diploma. Since then, 47 staff were recruited for regulatory departments.  Of these, two hold PhD qualifications; 26 have master degrees or professional accounting, legal or actuarial qualifications; 14 hold a primary degree and two have diplomas.</P>
        <P>Arrangements for the filling of vacancies at senior management level are in the final stages of the recruitment process.  In recent weeks a large number of technical positions (aimed at senior officer level) have been advertised to fill some 80 positions within the organisation.  This recruitment is aimed at widening the Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s expertise in the following areas: credit, treasury, market risk, legal, enforcement and policy.  The Authority expects that a large number of these posts will be filled in the summer months. The remaining posts, which include a number of clerical or administrative positions, will be addressed shortly.</P>

These Bills will form part of the Central Bank Acts and the publication of a consolidation Bill would not be appropriate until the first two stages of the process are complete. </P>

	<P>I have said previously, that I was disappointed but not surprised that Postbank is to close at the end of the year.  The management of commercial decisions made by Postbank, which include the decision to wind-down the institution, is a matter for An Post and its joint venture partner BGL BNP Paribas, and one in which I have no direct role. </P>
        <P>In considering the future of Postbank, the partners explored a number of options to ensure the continuation of the Postbank operation, including the transfer of BNP&rsquo;s shareholding to another institution.  I understand, however, that this was not considered to be viable.  An Post has been providing some banking services as an agent for a leading bank for several years and I understand will continue to do so even after Postbank ceases to trade.  The underlying strengths of the network will allow An Post to develop other strategic opportunities in the financial services business and the board and management of An Post are actively engaging in this process.  I also understand that options are currently being considered that will result in a significant number of the jobs at Postbank being saved.</P>
        <P>Deposit funds in Postbank are secure and I understand that Postbank will write to its customers in the coming weeks with information on the options that will be open to them.  This process will be carried out in compliance with the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.</P>

	<P>The provisions of the car scrappage scheme as  set out  in Section 102 of the Finance Bill as published on 4 February 2010, provide that the car being scrapped, </P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />must be registered in the State in the name of the registered owner of the new car for at least 18 months previous to the date of scrappage;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />must be 10 years old or more from the date of first registration;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />must be scrapped on or after 10 December 2009 and not later than 31 December 2010;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />must be scrapped within 60 days of the date of the new car being registered, or have been scrapped within 60 days immediately before the date of the new car being registered;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />must have a valid NCT test certificate, or one that has expired no more than 90 days immediately before the date of scrappage or documentation to indicate that it has been presented for and failed an NCT roadworthiness test in the previous 6 months;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />must have been insured for use on the road in the name of the registered owner for at least 12 months in the 18 months immediately prior to the date of scrappage.</P><Col N="124"/>
        <P FLI="0">I received a number of representations regarding the fact that many vehicles are acquired for use as &lsquo;family vehicles&rsquo; and are frequently registered for VRT purposes in the name of one spouse, but insured in the name of the other spouse.</P>
        <P>I have considered the matter further and I decided that the scope of the scheme under Section 102 of the Bill, be extended by making an amendment to the Finance Bill at Committee Stage providing that any reference to a &ldquo;person&rdquo; in the relevant subsection of the section may in the application of those provisions be construed by the Revenue Commissioners as a reference to either the person concerned, or to that person&rsquo;s spouse.</P>
        <P>Consequently documentation in the name of one spouse is to be taken into account for the purposes of the other qualifying under the scheme.  Following this change, documents relating to vehicle ownership and vehicle insurance can be presented in the name of either spouse in order to qualify for the repayment of VRT.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190, 207, 225 and 226 together. </P>
        <P>The European Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a Directive to regulate the managers of alternative investment funds was due to be discussed at Ecofin on March 16th. However, the Spanish Presidency withdrew this item from the agenda because it believed that it had not received sufficient support at that stage for the proposed compromise text. Negotiations will continue and the Presidency aim to discuss this issue at Ecofin in the near future.</P>
        <P>Many believe that, instead of focussing on the managers of these alternative investment funds, it would have been preferable to regulate the funds themselves directly.  I understand that the European Commission considered such an approach but, because many funds are domiciled in jurisdictions outside the EU, they decided that the best approach would be to regulate the managers of all non-UCITS.  I understand that the main reason for this is that the Commission would have encountered problems in trying to find a legally sound definition of a &ldquo;hedge fund&rdquo;.  They were unable to devise a definition that could not be exploited or create loop-holes, therefore it decided that the best approach was to regulate the level of the managers rather than the fund, the so-called &ldquo;all encompassing approach&rdquo;.  I appreciated the Commission&rsquo;s difficulties in that regard and supported their approach.</P>
        <P>In view of the fact that the proposal would apply to all non-UCITS, it was proposed that a threshold be established to allow Member States apply proportionate rules to all fund managers, bearing in mind that the prevention of systemic risk was one of the main reasons behind the proposal.  The proposed thresholds would allow supervisors to apply a lower regulatory standard to the managers of smaller funds, such as forestry funds for example.  This is a practical approach to the issue of thresholds, while meeting the wider issue of systemic risk prevention.</P>
        <P>The treatment of fund managers established outside the EU, so-called &ldquo;third country managers&rdquo;, was one of the most difficult issues that arose with this dossier and a number of issues arose in relation to this.  On the one hand, there was a view that third country managers should be allowed to operate within the EU without restriction. On the other hand, there were con<Col N="127"/>cerns that such an approach would not be consistent with the objectives of the Directive and would leave EU fund managers at a competitive disadvantage in relation to non-EU managers.  In view of the range of complex issues associated with this, the Spanish Presidency proposed a draft compromise text whereby these third country managers, would have to comply with certain reporting and disclosure requirements before they could operate in a particular Member State, but that they could not avail of the &ldquo;passport&rdquo; to operate throughout the EU, without establishing a physical presence in a Member State. The proposal requires that appropriate co-operation agreements should be in place between the relevant Member State and third country. On balance, I believe this to be the best option available in the circumstances.</P>
        <P>The original Commission proposal contained a provision to impose a limit on the amount of leverage a fund manager could employ the so-called &ldquo;leverage cap&rdquo;.  While such a leverage cap found little support among Member States, in recognition of the importance of monitoring the leverage employed by managers, provisions have been maintained to ensure that supervisors will have all the relevant information available to them to allow them to properly assess exposures. I believe that this is an appropriate approach.</P>
        <P>It is clear that one of the key aims of the proposal was to strengthen the disclosure, reporting and transparency requirements. The proposal contains a large number of measures which impose additional reporting obligations on fund managers.  Many industry commentators have criticised the scale of these additional requirements and regard them as onerous and burdensome. However, I believe that an appropriate balance has been found.</P>
        <P>The other points which were raised regarding naked short-selling, stealth acquisitions and empty voting are not included within the scope of the Commission&rsquo;s initial proposal, although the proposal does contain provisions regarding the acquisition of non-listed companies.</P>
        <P>Effective and efficient financial market regulation and supervision is central to the safeguarding of consumer interests, ensuring that financial markets and financial institutions operate in an open and transparent manner consistent with their stability and the stability of the financial system as a whole.  It is also important that the legislative and policy framework for financial services supports the competitiveness of the sector and maintains in an appropriate way a level playing field among market participants.  It is an important priority in formulating legislative proposals at EU level to strike an appropriate balance between these objectives.  The funds industry is a valuable sector of the economy which provides direct employment to approximately 12,500 people with many more indirectly employed.  The proposal, like all other measures aimed at improving the internal market, has the potential to impact on the financial services industry in Ireland, but equally it offers opportunities for developing new business practices aligned with the new regulatory regime as it evolves in the period ahead.</P>

	<P>In relation to the VAT treatment of purchases of equipment by school boards of management, the position is that bodies supplying educational services and non-profit organisations are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase.  Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT. </P>

	<P>It is assumed that the change mentioned in the question is an effective increase in the top rate of income tax by 15 percentage points from 41% to 56% for incomes in excess of &euro;150,000. It is also assumed that the threshold for the proposed new tax band mentioned by the Deputy would not alter the existing standard rate band structure applying to single and widowed persons, to lone parents and married couples.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2010 incomes, of the introduction of a new 56% rate in the manner described would be of the order of &euro;558 million. </P>
        <P>Given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how in practice such a new rate could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.</P>

	<P>The Civil Service has developed a complex set of rules and procedures in relation to sick leave and these arrangements form a significant part of the terms and conditions of employment of all civil servants.  The policy was updated in 2007.  Since then, a further up date and revision of the policy has been developed and presented to the Staff Unions.  This policy takes on board the concerns raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General 2009 Special Report on Sickness Absence in the Civil Service, and provides a general framework of guidelines on more efficient management of sick leave.  The policy is also aimed at reducing absence from work which should result in reduction in cost of sick leave. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the day to day management of sickness absence rests with each Government Department or Office. My Department is working with Civil Service Departments and Offices to ensure development of appropriate systems of absence management, in line with best practice, and to ensure that Departments/Offices give a high priority to their proper implementation.  Each Department has IT systems to record attendance and absences in the Civil Service namely a Time and Attendance system and a Human Resource Management System (HRMS).  These systems form one part of absence management/controls and are aimed at complementing the non-IT systems, the manual business processes in place for checking, cross referencing and validating absences, thus providing an overall robust system for absence <Col N="130"/>management in organisations.

        <P>Under the arrangements in place up to that time, PAYE taxpayers who were members of such schemes were obliged to purchase an annuity with their main pension fund immediately on retirement after taking their tax-free lump sum.

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a benefit-in-kind charge arises on an employee where a car owned by the employer is available for private use. This includes travel between the employee&rsquo;s home and place of work </P>
        <P>Section 121 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a benefit-in-kind charge in respect of the private use of a car provided to an employee by an employer based on 30% of the Original Market Value (OMV) of the vehicle.  This charge is reduced on a sliding scale where the business mileage of the individual in the year of assessment is in excess of 24,000 kilometres (for example, where the business mileage is in excess of 48,000 kilometres per year the charge is based on 6% of the Original Market Value of the car).  Where an individual is required to use a car solely for the purposes of the performance of their official duties and that car is returned to the employer&rsquo;s premises at the end of the working day, no charge to benefit-in-kind will arise.</P>
        <P>Section 121A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a benefit-in-kind charge in respect of the private use of a van based on 5% of the Original Market Value.  This charge will not apply where the van is necessary for the employee&rsquo;s work, the employee is required by the employer to take the van home when not being used for work, private use of the van, other than travel to and from work, is prohibited and there is in fact no other private use, and the employee spends at least 80% of his or her working time away from the premises where the employee is attached.</P><Col N="131"/>
        <P>The difference in treatment between cars and vans is due to the inherent design and use differences between the two types of vehicles. A van &ldquo;is designed or constructed solely or mainly for the carriage of goods or other burden&rdquo;.  In both cases, the charge can be reduced by any amount which an employee is required to make good and actually pays to the employer towards running costs.</P>

I would not consider this helpful and it will not aid the economic recovery of the banks if they incur high losses on risky loans they are forced into.  However, the Deputy may be aware that under the NAMA Act I will shortly be issuing guidelines to ensure that SMEs, sole traders and farm enterprises will have recourse to an independent, external review of decisions of credit refusal by the NAMA participating banks.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the supply of e-books is subject to VAT at the standard rate of 21% when sold by Irish based suppliers to consumers in Ireland or in any other EU Member State.  The Irish rate applies also to sales of e-books into Ireland from suppliers outside the EU.  However, when an Irish consumer purchases e-books from a supplier in another Member State the VAT rate is the applicable rate in the supplier&rsquo;s Member State.</P>
        <P>EU Directive 2008/8/EC contains a provision that deals with the VAT treatment of the supply of electronic services supplied to consumers.  It provides that, with effect from 1 January 2015, the place of taxation of these services will change to where the consumer resides. This means that VAT on electronic services including e-books will be chargeable in the consumer&rsquo;s Member State.  All business-to-business sales of e-books are already taxed in the business customer&rsquo;s Member State.</P>
        <P>Under EU VAT law, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  Consequently, it is not possible to exempt e-books from VAT.</P>
        <P>Regarding discussions at EU level, the Deputy may be referring to the agreement of May 2009 regarding changes made to Annex III of the VAT Directive which lists certain goods and services to which Member States may optionally apply the reduced VAT rate, which in Ireland is 13.5%. This includes books in all physical forms but does not include books delivered electronically.</P>

	<P>As I said in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 10848/10 of 3 March 2010, the current work to rule and other actions, which are impacting on processing Parliamentary Questions and providing information to public representatives are part of a programme of industrial action undertaken by public service unions across the public sector. The industrial action is in response to the pay reductions imposed by the Government on public servants with effect from 1 January last as part of the Government&rsquo;s budgetary strategy to bring the public finances under control.</P>
        <P>In order to address issues raised by the programme of industrial action in the public sector, my Department has established a co-ordination group of all public service sectors affected to monitor and review service delivery and other issues arising from the industrial action. Any industrial action, whatever form it takes, is regrettable, in particular if it has any impact on service delivery to the public.  Public Service management are doing what they can to minimise any such impact. As the Deputy will know discussion are currently taking place between the <Col N="133"/>Government and the Public Service Unions with a view to achieving the necessary transformation to the public service into the future.</P>

	<P>The procurement policy of my Department regarding cloud computing is the same as that regarding any other area, namely that it facilitates open competition, best value for money and best technological fit to requirements while complying with all relevant national and EU legislation.  I am aware that the National Public Procurement Operations Unit (NPPOU) recently issued a message to members of the eProcurement Network (public sector buyers on eTenders) stating that where the use of cloud computer systems are being considered, that it is essential to obtain prior legal advice due to the potential risk of liability to the State.</P>
        <P>The NPPOU considers this to be prudent advice to any prospective buyer of any IT solution. However, I am aware that the advice may have been interpreted by some as instructing public bodies not to procure cloud computing solutions. That is not the case.  My Department is actively examining cloud computing technologies to determine the most appropriate approaches for the public service, taking into consideration the usual requirements with respect to costs, security and data protection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 1913, the United States (US) has had a system of citizenship-based taxation, under which a US citizen is liable to pay US Income Tax on their worldwide income, regardless of where they are resident.  This is also combined with a residence-based system under which &ldquo;resident aliens&rdquo; (that is, non-US citizens who are resident in the US) are liable to US tax on their worldwide income.  </P>
        <P>A number of issues would arise if citizenship-based taxation was introduced in Ireland.  Initially, there are large numbers of Irish citizens living abroad who have no Irish-sourced income or gains.  These include all Irish people who have emigrated and made their lives abroad permanently for a variety of reasons, but chose to maintain their links with Ireland and Irish-citizenship.  These people have no liability to Irish tax as they are non-resident within the existing residence rules and, even if domiciled in Ireland, have no income which is subject to Irish tax.  Making these people subject to Irish taxation on the basis of citizenship would be an inefficient and ineffective use of the resources available to the Revenue Commissioners.  The position of persons living in Northern Ireland would also have to be considered.</P>
        <P>In addition, modifications would have to be made to Ireland&rsquo;s Double Taxation Agreements (other than the DTA with the US) to provide that one contracting State reserves the right to tax its citizens wherever they are resident.  However, this would lead to difficulties in negotiating new DTAs or even the cancellation of existing DTAs, which would damage our international competitiveness.  The change would also be against the OECD norm, whereby residents are taxable on worldwide income and non-residents are taxable on income arising in the State.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Domicile Levy, which was announced in the Budget, is charged on an individual who is Irish-domiciled and an Irish citizen whose world-wide income <Col N="137"/>exceeds &euro;1m, their Irish-located property is greater than &euro;5m, and their liability to Irish Income Tax was less than &euro;200,000.  The levy has been introduced to ensure that every wealthy Irish-domiciled person will make a contribution to the State.  Finally, I am not aware of any discussions on the introduction of a citizenship-based taxation across the EU.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The rationale for the introduction of section 139 of the Finance Bill 2010 (as initiated) is to streamline and modernise the administration and collection of Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT).  The changes will lower compliance costs for taxpayers and simplify and streamline administration for both agents and Revenue.  The proposals originated out of an internal review of the existing procedures by the Revenue Commissioners and a subsequent public consultation process on CAT.  Many of the existing processes around the administration of the tax are out of line with self-assessment principles and they involve excessive certification and clearance procedures having regard to the risks involved, and the alternatives available to Revenue for managing those risks.  </P>
        <P>The measures in the Bill, which are designed to be Exchequer neutral, will allow Revenue to implement changes which will:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />eliminate up to 75% of current CAT documentation;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />free up Revenue staff resources for more productive audit and compliance work;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />deliver faster, simpler and more straightforward processes for taxpayers and their agents; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />allow the development of CAT audit and compliance programmes that are integrated into Revenue&rsquo;s overall risk evaluation and analysis programme.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The abolition of secondary accountability and the 12 year CAT charge on property are being applied with effect from the date of the passing of the Finance Bill and these changes will apply to inheritances and gifts, regardless of when they were taken.  Therefore, the change is being made retrospectively.  However, it should be noted that once the new procedures are in place, all CAT returns, regardless of the date of the gift or inheritance, will be integrated into Revenue&rsquo;s risk-driven audit and compliance programmes.  Therefore, there is no need to maintain separate systems for gifts or inheritances taken before the introduction of the new procedures.</P>
        <P>The Deputy can be assured that I was not lobbied on any aspect of the CAT modernisation package, including the abolition of secondary accountability and the 12 year CAT charge.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In my reply to a Parliamentary Question of 10 March 2010 concerning remuneration of members of the National Assets Management Agency (NAMA), I indicated that, under section 21 (1) and 25 (9) of the NAMA Act 2009, I had approved the following fee arrangements.  Chairperson &mdash; all inclusive fee of &euro;170,000 per annum on the understanding that the incumbent is available without restriction. Chairperson of Credit Committee &mdash; all inclusive fee of &euro;150,000 per annum on the understanding that the incumbent works no less than 3 to 4 days a week. Ordinary Board Members (5 remaining board members) &mdash; fee of &euro;50,000 per annum. Chair of other Committees &mdash; fee of &euro;10,000 per annum in addition to Ordinary Board Member fee subject to a maximum of one per member.  </P>
        <P>The total cost in 2010 is therefore likely to be &euro;470,000 and an additional amount dependent upon how many sub-committees are established by the Board of NAMA. However, given that board members can receive a maximum of one fee for Chairing another Committee and given the fact that neither the Chair nor the Chair of the credit Committee can receive this extra fee as their main fee is all-inclusive the maximum extra cost of payments to Chairs of other Committees is &euro;50,000.</P>
        <P>Originally, the fees for the Chairperson and Ordinary Board Members had been set at &euro;100,000 and &euro;38,000 respectively when the Board was appointed on 22 December 2009. Following discussions with the Chairperson and the Chief Executive of the National Treasury Management Agency last month and in light of the workload of the Board&rsquo;s operations over the initial period of its operation I revised these fees from a current date.</P>
        <P>I further indicated that in setting the fees account was taken of the critical importance of the work to be undertaken by the Board and the fact that its workload will be excessive by normal standards in the first year of operation. I also indicated that I intended to review the fees after a year.</P>

	<P>I can assure the Deputy that I am aware of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) that, following its adoption in May 2003 by the 56th World Health Assembly, was signed by Ireland on 10 September 2003 and ratified on 7 November 2005. </P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the current discussions that are taking place at a meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) in Geneva are for the purposes of drafting and negotiating a protocol on the illicit trade in tobacco products in order to build on and complement the provisions of Article 15 of the FCTC.</P>
        <P>As this protocol concerns the illicit trade in tobacco products, Ireland has been represented at all four INB meetings held to date, including the latest, by officials from the Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for tackling the smuggling of tobacco products rather than by officials from my Department or the Department of Health and Children who would normally represent Ireland at meetings organised by the World Health Organisation.</P>
        <P>As regards the protocol, while I understand that progress has been slow primarily because of the difficulty in drafting a protocol that is acceptable to all 168 countries that are parties to the FCTC, I can assure the Deputy that Ireland, along with the other Member States of the European Union, is pushing for the adoption of a strong and balanced protocol that will contain effective and meaningful measures to combat the illicit trade in tobacco products on a world wide basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 235 together.</P>
        <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the challenge for businesses in meeting their tax obligations in a timely fashion and the requirement on individuals and companies to ensure that at least the minimum amounts of preliminary tax, whether in regard to corporation tax or income tax, are paid.</P>
        <P>This is a matter in the first instance for the Revenue Commissioners who are charged with responsibility for the timely collection and recovery of taxes and duties due to the Exchequer. I know that Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their tax and duty responsibilities by paying the right amount and on time. Revenue expects businesses to continue, notwithstanding the more difficult economic circumstances in which they are operating at present, to organise their financial affairs in such a fashion as to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due. I fully support what Revenue are doing in that regard.</P>
        <P>Revenue is very conscious of and appreciates that the difficult economic and financial climate that prevails poses challenges for business in being timely compliant. Revenue have responded to the difficult environment by actively encouraging businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise in order find an agreed way through those difficulties and quickly restore voluntary timely compliance. Revenue has developed an administrative framework to manage such cases, and has published material for businesses experiencing tax payment difficulties on its website www.revenue.ie.</P>
        <P>Where businesses or individuals fail to meet their tax payment obligations on time, including the need to pay the necessary amount of preliminary tax for income tax or corporation tax, then those individuals or businesses are liable to interest. Interest on late payment of tax operates not just as a compensation for the Exchequer for the late payment of monies due to it but also levels the playing field between those who meet their tax obligations on time and <Col N="142"/>those who pay late. I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s actions in regard to the collection of interest are reasonable. Those businesses and individuals who comply on a voluntary and timely basis must be confident that their efforts are recognised through the imposition and collection of interest from those who pay late.</P>

        <P Just="Left"><sup>2</sup>From 4 September to 5 December 2010 the National Gallery in Dublin will host an exhibition of works by Gabriel Metsu, a 17th Century Dutch painter. The Metsu exhibition will then go to the Rijksmuseum from 21 December to 21 March 2011. This exhibition presents an opportunity to present Dublin and Ireland as a Cultural Destination of significance.  The press reception on March 15th aims (1) to present Dublin as a cultural &ldquo;City Break&rdquo; destination with a wealth of cultural things to see and do, and (2) to announce a group trip to Dublin in September for Dutch press, which will offer a  sneak preview of the exhibition.  The target audience (of 40 people) at the press reception will be National Press (Lifestyle, Newspapers, Travel trade and specialist media), and Irish business and agency contacts in the Netherlands.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><sup>3</sup>The Regional Water Authorities are concerned, <i>inter alia</i>, with water control/management, and in the development and implementation of international policy (EU). From their web page:  &ldquo;To exchange knowledge and experiences, Regional Water Authorities cooperate with foreign authorities and institutions. To this end, they (via the Association of Regional Water Authorities) are involved in international organisations working in the field of water management, like EUREAU and EUWMA.   There is foreign interest in the manner in which the Netherlands organises its water management and in which Regional Water Authorities play a keyrole. The Dutch Association of Regional Water Authorities is a member of the Netherlands Water Partnership, the platform of the Dutch water sector.   Dutch expertise can play a role in solving problems elsewhere. But foreign experiences can also contribute to Dutch water management. Whether it concerns joint solutions to shared (cross-border) problems, exchange of expertise, or application of expertise abroad, it is impossible to imagine life without international cooperation in the world of water. Nearly all Regional Water Authorities have developed international activities. In total, over 35 countries are involved.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left"><sup>4</sup>The Ireland Netherlands Business Association (INBA) is a business networking association which works closely with Irish State agencies and the broader Dutch and Irish business communities in the Netherlands. Its membership ranges from international public companies to small and medium sized companies and semi-state organisations. Through periodic networking events, INBA provides a forum for networking and communication. These networking events include twice-yearly dinners, the invitation lists for which are drawn from across the Netherlands-Ireland business communities. Recent speakers at INBA dinners include former Taoisigh Dr. Garret FitzGerald and Bertie Ahern, entrepreneur Harry Crosbie, U2 Manager Paul McGuinness, former Minister for Finance Ruair&iacute; Quinn, Dutch Minister for European Affairs Frans Timmermans, and Peter Sutherland SC, Chairman of BP plc. and of Goldman Sachs International, and UN Special Representative for Migration and Development.</P>

        <Quest> the process by which a person who overpaid the income levy in 2009 but who has not worked with the same employer continuously throughout 2009 can apply for a refund of this overpayment; the length of time this process should take; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a person who has overpaid income levy can apply for a refund in one of two ways as described below. In making an application a person should use the figures from the Income Levy Certificates which he/she will have received from his/her employer in respect of each employment held in 2009. The person should either:</P>
<P el="5" LI="1">(i) Complete an Income Levy Refund Claim Form and send it to their local Revenue office. The form is available to download from www.revenue.ie or from Revenue&rsquo;s Forms and Leaflets Service, which can be contacted at 1890 30 67 06; or</P>
<P el="5" LI="1">(ii) Submit their claim using the on-line facility at www.revenue.ie</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Refund claims would normally be processed within 20 working days in accordance with Revenue&rsquo;s customer service standards. Unfortunately, however, Income Levy refund claims forms are among items of work currently embargoed in the on-going industrial action by certain Public Sector unions and accordingly it is not possible to say when claims will be dealt with. Talks between public service management and unions are continuing with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission in an effort to resolve the current dispute.</P>

	<P>A draft employment control framework for 2010 for the health service is currently the subject of discussion with the Department of Finance. </P>
        <P>Employment control frameworks have been used for a number of years in the health sector to give effect to Government policies on the number employed in the health sector. The 2009 framework gave effect to the Government decision on the moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade. A HSE circular issued which gave effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.</P>
        <P>The Government decision was modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability. The 2009 framework specifically exempted a number of front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium. The focus on these key grades was in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding was already provided. The overall result was to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care. This would mean reorganising and restructuring work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery. The redeployment and reassignment of staff would be an essential part of this process. It is a matter of great concern that the level of flexibility from staff and unions required to achieve the changes needed, is not forthcoming at the moment, due to the ongoing industrial action across the public service.</P>
        <P>Health employment levels are monitored by the Joint Employment Control Monitoring Committee, which comprises officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the HSE. This committee also reviews the implementation of the moratorium and any issues arising.</P>

	<P>The issue of wage rates is governed by the employer/employee relationship. In the case of Trinity College Dublin as Minister for Health and Children I am neither involved nor have a role in relation to this matter.  More broadly, the Government continues to place considerable importance on the promotion of research.  Last year I launched an Action Plan for Health Research which seeks to bring about <Col N="148"/>an increase in the extent and quality of health research, including health policy research. Of course the current economic environment means all areas in receipt of public funds must seek to control costs and achieve more with limited resources.</P>

	<P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.</P>
        <P>Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia in respect of adoption. Consideration of this matter is at an early stage. I can confirm that I have had ongoing contact with the Irish Ethiopian Adoption Organisation to discuss the position.</P>
        <P>I brought forward at Committee stage an amendment to the Adoption Bill 2009 that will enable prospective adoptive parents to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague or non-bilateral country, if prior to the establishment date, they have been issued with a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt. The proposed amendment requires that the Adoption Authority (to be set up under the Act) would be satisfied that the particular adoption meets all the standards of the Hague Convention. Following the Committee stage debate I am also giving consideration to the possibility of including the three month &lsquo;cooling off&rsquo; period provided for in the ratification process for the Hague Convention in the transitional provision.</P>

	<P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.  Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia in respect of adoption. Consideration of this matter is at an early stage.</P>
        <P>I brought forward at Committee stage an amendment to the Adoption Bill 2009 that will enable prospective adoptive parents to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague or non-bilateral country, if prior to the establishment date, they have been issued with a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt. The proposed amendment requires that the Adoption Authority (to be set up under the Act) would be satisfied that the particular adoption meets all the standards of the Hague Convention. Following the Committee stage debate I am also giving consideration to the possibility of including the three month &lsquo;cooling off&rsquo; period provided for in the ratification process for the Hague Convention in the transitional provision.</P>
        <P>The HSE and the Adoption Board are both aware of the deadlines associated with the transitional measure and are making every effort to process applications on hand for Declarations of Eligibility and Suitability to Adopt prior to commencement of the legislation.</P>

	<P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has no plans to introduce a scheme of financial support specifically for short-term care in nursing homes.  However, I would like to alert the Deputy to the availability of the respite care grant which is paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to carers and which can be used to cover the cost of short-term care in a nursing home.  I would also like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to a number of wider developments which are currently ongoing and which are of relevance to the issue of short-term care.</P>
        <P>Firstly, the Department of Health and Children is currently preparing a new legislative framework to provide for clear statutory provisions on eligibility and entitlement for all health and personal social services.   On completion of this undertaking, proposals will be brought to Government for approval.  Secondly, the Department has commenced work on analysis of future funding models for long-term care.  This work will involve a detailed exploration of financially sustainable funding options to support the provision of all long-term care services, both community-based and residential.  In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting people to live in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, the work will consider the continuum of care services, including the role of  short-term care, such as step-down or respite care, within nursing homes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The health sector is one of the most complex areas of activity in every country and it must, by its very nature, command the confidence of those who use it.  While I am confident that the majority of patients in Ireland receive effective and safe treatment, unfortunately, errors do occur in any health service.  It is important therefore, that we have systems in place to minimize risk of occurrence and to detect and respond appropriately to them when they do occur.  Patient safety has always been high on my agenda and on the agenda of this Government as is evident from various initiatives I  have taken in this regard.</P>
        <P>I established the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) in 2007.  One of the main functions of the Authority is the setting of standards and monitoring healthcare quality.  The Authority also has the power to undertake investigations as to the safety, quality and standards of services where it is believed that there is a serious risk to the health and welfare of a person receiving services.  The Authority has carried out a number of investigations in recent years and there is acknowledged to be public confidence in the work of HIQA.</P>
        <P>In January 2007, I established a Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that quality and safety for patients is paramount within the healthcare system.  The Commission did consider the option of creating a new, stand-alone agency for Patient Safety.  However, after much deliberation, the Commission concluded that it would be better to continue the momentum already built up through the working of the Commission and the improvements in patient safety that had already been made by the existing regulatory bodies.  It was the Commission&rsquo;s view that a new patient safety agency, with a very broad remit, would require major legislative, structural and organisational changes which would take some years  to put in place, thereby delaying the effective implementation of the recommendations in the Report.   The Commission&rsquo;s Report &mdash; <i>Building a Culture of Patient Safety</i> was published in August 2008 and approved by Government in January 2009.   The report contains 134 recommendations spanning almost every area of the health service.  The most significant recommendation of the report is the introduction of a licensing system for all health services whether they are delivered publicly or privately based on standards to be set by HIQA.  The Commission also proposed that the licensing scheme should be operated by HIQA.  HIQA&rsquo;s role in the licensing process, its overall remit in setting standards and monitoring health care quality and its achievements in this area to date, reinforces the Commission&rsquo;s strong emphasis on patient safety and quality and further obviates the need for a new agency.</P>
        <P>An Implementation Steering Group (ISG), chaired by my Department&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer, was established in June 2009 with clear and regular reporting obligations to me regarding progress on the implementation of all the recommendations; this Implementation process is well advanced.  The overall approach to the implementation plan endorsed by the Commission was to avoid short-term structural changes and, instead, to build on the structures already in place.  The Commission considered that this was the best way of delivering results quickly.  Finally, in March 2009 the provisions of the Health Act 2007 on protected disclosures were commenced.  This facilitates all healthcare staff to disclose matters of concern to them to an authorised person and to provide statutory protection against penalisation in their workplace and against civil liability.</P><Col N="160"/>
        <P>All the above measures are paving the way for a new culture of patient safety, openness, transparency, learning and accountability.  On this basis, I do not see a need for, and am not proposing, the establishment of a separate office to which  shortcomings can be referred.</P>

	<P>The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.</P>
        <P>I brought forward at Committee stage an amendment to the Adoption Bill 2009 that will enable prospective adoptive parents to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague or non-bilateral country, if prior to the establishment date, they have been issued with a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt. The proposed amendment requires that the Adoption Authority (to be set up under the Act) would be satisfied that the particular adoption meets all the standards of the Hague Convention. Following the Committee stage debate I am also giving consideration to the possibility of including the three month &lsquo;cooling off&rsquo; period provided for in the ratification process for the Hague Convention in the transitional provision.</P>
        <P>The HSE and the Adoption Board are both aware of the deadlines associated with the transitional measure and are making every effort to process applications on hand for Declarations of Eligibility and Suitability to Adopt prior to commencement of the legislation.</P>

	<P>The Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS) is a statutory body under the aegis of my Department. A contributory funded pension scheme, sponsored by the employer, was set up for employees in 1963. The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a public service body as defined in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2009 and consequently its employees are public servants within the terms of that Act. The pension scheme in place  comes under the scope of a public service pension scheme as defined in section 1 of the Act &lsquo;provided for under an administrative measure to like effect as the Superannuation Acts&rsquo;. The pension related deduction is required to be remitted to the Exchequer in all cases.</P>
        <P>Officials from both my Department and the Department of Finance met with the Irish Blood Transfusion Service some weeks ago at the behest of the employer to discuss the scheme and its fund.The issue of future pension provision for IBTS employees is currently under consideration by both  Departments.</P>

Work is already well advanced by the Authority on the development of the standards which will underpin this system of licensing.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the Authority to decide how best to monitor compliance with any standards, including making unannounced inspections.</P>

	<P>Employees of the Meath, Adelaide incorporating the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital (Tallaght), are superannuated under the Voluntary Hospital Superannuation Schemes and therefore any retirement benefits are payable in  accordance with its&rsquo; scheme rules. The administration of that scheme was devolved to the Health Service Executive in February 2007. My Department has had no discussions, correspondence, agreement or approval in respect of potential retirement benefits in relation to the individual concerned.</P>

        <P>I am aware of the correspondence that the Deputies refer to.  Statutory responsibility for the regulation of safety standards of civil aviation in the State has been vested in the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) under the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993.  I have no function in this regard.</P>
        <P>I understand from the IAA that it issued a consultation document on the current requirements for microlight operations in the State on 5th February.  The consultation period has recently ended and I understand that the IAA has undertaken to publish the outcome of this review in mid-April.  Prior to this recent consultation process, I understand from the IAA that its officers had met representatives of the National Microlight Association of Ireland on seven occasions between January 2009 and 2010.  I trust that the comprehensive review of the requirements for microlight operations that is currently underway will afford all parties with an interest in this matter to make their views known and that all submissions will be given due consideration by the IAA in completing its review.</P>

Accordingly consideration of the best way to support the project will take account of the extent of potential investment by the DAA on foot <Col N="174"/>of its evaluation of the business case and any support that could be provided by the State, subject to compliance with EU state aid rules.</P>
        <P>The Ireland-U.S. Preclearance Agreement signed by myself and the then U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, on 17 November 2008, does not provide for the preclearance of cargo.  However, this is an issue that I raised with Secretary Chertoff at the time and later with his successor Janet Napolitano. Both indicated an openness to further consideration of the feasibility of cargo preclearance from Ireland, but the first priority is to fully establish passenger preclearance for commercial and general aviation at Dublin.</P>

	<P>In 2009, I approved proposals for the amalgamation of (i) the Air Accident Investigation Unit of my Department, (ii) the Railway Accident Investigation Unit of the Railway Safety Commission and (iii) the Marine Casualty Investigation Board to form the Irish Accident Investigation Office (I.A.I.O.) as an executive office within my Department.  Those proposals entail the physical co-location of the three investigative bodies in existing Departmental accommodation in Dublin.  Those facilities require adaptation to meet specialist investigative needs. That work will commence shortly, subject to successful tendering by the Office of Public Works, and is anticipated that it will be completed in the third quarter of 2010. The accommodation will become available for occupation by the I.A.I.O. shortly thereafter.  Preparatory work on legislation to underpin the functions of the new Office is underway within my Department. Pending passage of that legislation, arrangements are in place to identify and implement the required administrative and operating synergies.</P>

	<P>Port State Control inspections onboard foreign flagged ships in Irish ports are carried out under the auspices of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Port State Control and EU Directives.  These inspections are carried out to check for compliance with international law. Ireland continues to work within the Paris MoU and with the other EU Member States to ensure the development of the necessary port state control procedures that will be required in connection with the entry into force of the Maritime Labour Convention. The new Convention sets out clear principles and rights for seafarers. EU Member States are committed to ratifying the new Convention by 31 December 2010 and it is expected to come into force internationally in 2011.  The Department&rsquo;s surveyors inspect over 400 foreign flagged ships per year and they detain any ship which poses a safety hazard or which does not comply with the international requirements on living and working arrangements. Of the over 400 annual inspections, 5 cruise ships were inspected in 2008 and 6 cruise ships in 2009.</P>

	<P>The Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations, 1992 sets out the provisions that must be complied with when ownership of a motor vehicle changes.  Some 750,000 notices of change of vehicle ownership are received annually in my Department and details of new owners are recorded on the National Vehicle and Driver File. As part of the recording process a number of administrative procedures are in place to ensure that ownership details are correctly recorded. </P>
        <P>Given the annual transaction volumes relatively few instances of incorrect ownership details are brought to attention. The evidence to date doesn&rsquo;t suggest that deliberate notification of incorrect owner details is a growing problem.  Once matters of this nature are brought to attention my Department takes action to remedy the situation and where appropriate An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are informed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 368 and 374 to 378, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There has been much ill-informed comment about the proposed new SAR contract. Because we are in the &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; period of the procurement process and about to commence contract <Col N="177"/>negotiations I am somewhat constrained by what I can say.  However I can make the following points in response to some comments made.</P>
        <P>The new contract has been presented as a &ldquo;cutback&rdquo; in services; nothing could be further from the truth.  The new contract will cost significantly more on an annual basis than the current contract because of the improved services to be provided.</P>
        <P>The Government has just approved a massive half a billion euro investment in maritime search and rescue capability on the island. The proposed contract represents a dramatic increase in funding for SAR helicopter services in Ireland from approximately &euro;30 million to &euro;50 million per annum. This is an increase, in difficult circumstances, of &euro;20 million a year in this service alone.  The new contract represents a stepped improvement in the capacity, range, speed and capability of Ireland&rsquo;s SAR service.  The detailed statistics requested cannot be provided at this time due to industrial action.  However I will provide the Deputies with a table and charts that may be of interest to them.</P>

        <P>No changes in helicopter availability will occur until the 1st of July 2013 and will be the subject of ongoing review.

However, I can assure Deputies that the Government is specifically committed to keeping the level of provision of service at Waterford under review in the period to 2013.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions 370, 381 and 382 together.  </P>
        <P>The implementation of the cost restructuring plan at Aer Lingus is entirely for the Board, Management and Staff of the company and it is not open to the Government to intervene. The industrial relations machinery of the State remains available to assist the parties where difficulties exist.  Indeed, the Labour Relations Commission recently intervened to invite the parties to separate talks on 19th March. Arising from those talks, I understand that IMPACT is to ballot cabin crew members again on the company&rsquo;s cost restructuring plan which the four other groups at the company had voted to accept.</P>
        <P>The duties of the three Government appointed directors to the board of Aer Lingus derive from the Companies Acts and, as such, the directors are obliged to pursue the best interests of the company. Subject to that duty, the three Government appointed directors are requested to seek to ensure that all decisions of the company that have significant implications for wider Government, aviation or regional development policies are considered at board level. In any such decisions they are directed to seek to reconcile commercial and public policy objectives.</P>
        <P>From an aviation policy perspective, the Government wants to see a financially stable and viable Aer Lingus competing in the Irish air transport market. The cornerstones of Government aviation policy are competitiveness and connectivity. A viable Aer Lingus is key to ensuring the achievement of these objectives.  I note that the Question relating to the impact on the Social Insurance Fund is also directed to my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade &amp; <Col N="179"/>Employment, who will address the Question insofar as it relates to her remit.  The restructuring of Aer Lingus has no bearing on Transport 21 projections.</P>

	<P>This is an operational matter for Irish Rail.  Irish Rail has informed me that no further work has taken place since November 2008 at North Esk depot or at Kent station, which would prevent or add significant costs to the potential reconnection of the depot to the rail network.</P>
        <P>I understand, however, that prior to that date, as a result of the loss of keg business in 2006, the track turnouts and crossover were removed. In addition the old signal cabin, which controlled movement in and out of the depot was not renewed or replaced as part of the Cork/Midleton line renewal and resignalling in 2008 and as a consequence was closed.  Annual maintenance savings of approx &euro;400,000 were achieved as a result.</P>
        <P>In order to re-open the depot Irish Rail has indicated that it would be necessary to install 2 new track turnouts and a crossover and to connect the depot to the new signalling system. It is currently determining the costs involved, as a new business opportunity for rail freight from North Esk has recently been identified.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of rural transport is a key objective in the Government&rsquo;s sustainable travel and transport plan, &ldquo;Smarter Travel &mdash; A Sustainable Transport Future&rdquo; and in my Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005. Reflecting the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to the programme the provision for the rural transport in 2010 is being maintained at &euro;11 million.</P>
        <P>In relation to further development of rural transport services a key step is to ensure that existing resources in this area are utilised as cost-effectively as possible. A number of initiatives are currently underway in the country exploring the potential for improved synergies between existing transport providers, which include the Health Service Executive for health transport, the Department of Education and Science for school transport, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Pobal for Rural <Col N="180"/>Transport Programme services and other transport providers, such as the Irish Wheelchair Association.</P>
        <P>These initiatives involve pilot transport projects in the North East and North West, an exercise to map all transport services in County Louth and a cross-border pilot rural community transport project under the auspices of the British/Irish Council. The outcome of these initiatives, as well as recent reports from the Citizens Information Board and the Joint Committee on Arts Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on the matter, will feed into the process for developing rural transport policy into the future.  The Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 introduces a modern framework for public transport services, including rural public transport services.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am  concerned at the incidence of burglaries and threats to the security of people&rsquo;s homes in Shannon Town and throughout the country.  Consequently, one of the policing priorities which I set for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2010 is achieving the maximum levels of safety for local communities.</P>
        <P>The  Garda Commissioner shares my concerns.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continually develop and implement crime prevention and detection strategies to target those who are committing burglaries.  These include intelligence-led and focused operations and a strong emphasis on crime prevention and reduction, with the aim of reducing not only crime but also the fear of crime and so ensuring a better quality of community life for all.</P>
        <P>A community policing ethos drives the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The number of personnel assigned as dedicated community Garda&iacute; has increased from 630 at the end of 2007 to 1,058 at the end of 2009, an increase of 68%.   An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also support a number of initiatives which promote a community contribution to increasing public safety, including Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch.</P>
        <P>Neighbourhood Watch is a crime prevention programme which aims to enlist the active co-operation of the community in a neighbourhood by observing and reporting suspicious activities and by so doing reducing the level of criminal behaviour.  Since its establishment, the Garda authorities have sought to encourage the active participation of the public in Neighbourhood Watch by encouraging and supporting communities to establish and maintain such initiatives and deploying crime prevention officers and liaison Garda&iacute; to assist schemes.  Neighbourhood Watch is supported by and operates under the Neighbourhood Watch Strategy 2007-2011, which has helped to strengthen its management and operation.</P>
        <P>In rural areas the Community Alert programme, which was set up by Muintir na T&iacute;re in association with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1985, is a national movement comprising more than 1,300 local groups dedicated to improving the quality of life of vulnerable people in rural Ireland, particularly the elderly.  My Department provides financial support to Community Alert.</P>
        <P>Penalties for burglary and aggravated burglary are severe.  A person who is convicted on indictment of the offence of burglary is liable to a fine or to a term of imprisonment of up to 14 years.  A conviction for aggravated burglary carries a sentence of life imprisonment.  Nevertheless, I have met the Attorney General with regard to the issue of mandatory sentencing for such crimes, and he has requested the Law Reform Commission to examine the issue.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that policing in local communities, either rural or urban, is a matter for all Garda&iacute; and not just those assigned to the role of community policing. It is also worth noting that the number of Garda&iacute; exclusively assigned to community policing has increased considerably in recent times. The  figures available at the end of 2009 show that there were 1,058 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na specifically assigned to community policing, out of a total attested strength of 14,547.  By comparison, at the end of 2007, 630 members were assigned to community policing, and the present number represents an increase of almost 68% on that figure.</P>
        <P>All members who are assigned to community policing operate on a full-time basis. These members are specifically tasked with the duty of liaising with communities within their policing Districts. The new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na National Model of Community Policing was launched early in 2009. This new model is about  renewing, re-invigorating and re-structuring  the community policing function within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver a consistent national structure to the <Col N="183"/>community policing function; a  more coordinated and efficient Garda service to the community; and the spread of good practices and quality service in community policing on a national basis.</P>
        <P>A National Community Policing Office has been established within Garda Community Relations Section to develop and oversee the implementation programme. The model is being rolled out nationwide in line with an action plan which has been developed for implementation. Training is ongoing and it is intended that every District Officer throughout the country will take ownership of community policing within his or her area of responsibility.

	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Garda&iacute; for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that an application for employment vetting has recently been received by the GCVU in respect of the person to whom the Deputy refers and it will be processed in the normal course.  It may be helpful in relation to the matter raised if I clarify the vetting process for the Deputy.  In response to a written request for vetting, the GCVU releases criminal history information in respect of the person concerned to the prospective recruiting organisation.  The information released would be factual information referring to convictions and prosecutions whether pending or completed and whether successful or unsuccessful.  Vetting is only carried out with the consent of the vetting subject.  This factual criminal history information is returned to the designated person in the registered organisation which submitted the vetting application.</P>
        <P>In the employment vetting process, therefore, it is not the function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take a decision on the suitability or otherwise of an individual applicant.  The results of the vetting application should form only one element of the overall recruitment decision, albeit an important one.  The decisions on the suitability for recruitment or appointment of the person concerned rest at all times, as they rightly should, with the recruiting organisation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 409 and 417 to 419, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Recruitment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by Statutory Regulation namely, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admission &amp; Appointments) Regulations 1988/2005. The recruitment age was considered as recently as 2004 when, on the recommendation of the Garda Commissioner, the maximum recruitment age was increased from 26 to 35 years. This was made by Statutory Instrument 749/2004 which amended regulation 164 of 1988.</P>
        <P>This upper age limit of 35 was set having regard to equality legislation and also took into account the following criteria:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(1) The cost of training</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(2) The need for recruits to serve for a sufficient period of time as full members of the service to recoup this cost.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(3) The operational requirements of the service in terms of having an age profile appropriate to the physical demands placed on members in the course of their duty.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There are no plans to change the upper age limit for recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at this time.</P>
        <P>Retirement of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by a number of statutory regulations which have the cumulative effect of setting the standard retirement age for members at 60 years of age. The setting of this age has been found by the High Court to be objective, reasonable and justifiable taking into account the general operational requirements of the force and to be consistent with Equality legislation and EU directives on the matter. Of course members with 30 years service may retire on a full pension at any time once they reach 50 years of age for those who joined prior to 2004 and 55 years of age for those who joined since that date.</P>
        <P>The legal proceedings referred to by the Deputy are currently before the Supreme Court and it not be appropriate to comment on them at this time.</P>

	<P>A person whose great-grandparent was born in Ireland may qualify for Irish citizenship by descent if one of the parents, being a grandchild of a citizen born in Ireland, had registered their name in the Foreign Births <Col N="189"/>Register prior to the person&rsquo;s birth. There is one exception to that rule.  If one parent had registered in the Foreign Births Register prior to 31 December 1986, their child can register even if the parent had not registered at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth.</P>
        <P>If persons are not entitled to Irish citizenship in these circumstances, they can apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation.  Such applications are considered under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 &mdash; 2004.  The applicant must fulfil certain statutory requirements including requirements in relation to residency.  However I am empowered to dispense with the statutory conditions in whole or in part in certain circumstances &mdash; for example where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations.  Every such application is decided upon on its individual circumstances and in accordance with the law.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that a review of the current framework for the acquisition of Irish citizenship is underway in my Department. That review will consider a wide range of issues relating to the current statutory framework as well as other administrative arrangements in the granting of citizenship. There is scope in the review for consideration of the issue raised by the Deputy. I propose that the review will, when published, be the subject of public consultation before any final proposals are settled. Any recommendations arising from that review which require amendments to Citizenship legislation will be brought forward in the normal way.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that applicants for naturalisation are having their applications deferred if they become unemployed, even when their work authorisation confines them to specific fields of employment; and his views on relaxing the work authorisation terms to allow such persons to apply for other jobs. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12434/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have adopted a general policy that I will normally require an applicant for naturalisation, unless he/she is a refugee, programme refugee or Stateless person, to show that he/she has supported him or herself (and his or her family if appropriate) while residing in the State and, as far as can be determined, is in a position to continue that support into the future. Where an applicant has become unemployed there is a doubt as to whether they will be in a position to support themselves into the future.  I have decided in some cases to defer a final decision on an application for a certificate of naturalisation, to give an applicant time to demonstrate that they can support themselves and their dependants. Invariably, this has been to the applicant&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware a new policy was implemented in 2009 whereby foreign nationals who had worked for 5 consecutive years with employment permits and who had kept their immigration permission up to date and met certain other conditions, were to be granted Stamp 4 immigration permission.   A certain tolerance was built into the system to cater for gaps in immigration registration, with gaps of up to 3 months duration being allowed subject to a maximum total for all gaps of 6 months in the 5 year period. Cases that do not meet these requirements are not eligible for the concession outlined under the new policy.  It should be noted that the concession is entirely ex-gratia and also that foreign nationals have a responsibility to keep their registration up to date.</P>
        <P>For persons who do not qualify for the concession, either because they have less than 5 years of employment permits or because their registration gaps exceed the permitted periods, the general provision for redundant workers apply.  These provisions, which have been considerably enhanced, allow for such persons to receive a 6 month grace period under an immigration Stamp 1 within which they can seek other employment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Garda&iacute; for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives &mdash; 187,864 in 2007; 218,404 in 2008 and 246,194 in 2009.</P>
        <P>The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase, for training placements for example.  Additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad. There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  However, the Garda&iacute; make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the average processing time for valid vetting applications received at the GCVU may vary from four to five weeks in periods of lower demand to up to 12 weeks at times when demand is particularly high.</P>
        <P>The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  There is currently a total of 78 personnel assigned to the vetting unit, including six Garda&iacute; and 72 Garda civilian personnel.  This represents a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development in Garda vetting began in 2005.</P>

	<P>The issue raised by the Deputy is primarily a civil matter and as such is outside the remit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receives a complaint about behaviour by neighbours, they can request them to cease that behaviour.  The Garda powers in this regard relate to ensuring that a breach of the peace does not occur. <b></b>In circumstances where the behaviour is anti-social within the meaning of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may issue a behaviour warning.</P>
        <P>Complainants may also be advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of their civil entitlements under section 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  A local authority, the Agency or any person may complain to the District Court regarding any noise, which is so loud, so continuous, so repeated and of such duration or pitch or occurring at such a time, as to give reasonable cause for annoyance.  The court may order the person or body making the noise to take the measures necessary to reduce the noise to a specified level or to take measures to limit or prevent the noise.</P>
        <P>There is provision in legislation under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for third parties who are adversely affected by the behaviour <Col N="192"/>of private or local authority tenants.  The Department has published details of the powers available to local authorities in relation to anti-social behaviour and information in relation to noise nuisance, including information relevant to local authority dwellings, private rented and privately owned dwellings, on its website www.environ.ie.  As part of the preparatory process for new legislation on noise pollution an extensive public consultation was undertaken by the Department.  After consideration of the submissions received during the consultation process, the General Scheme of a Noise Nuisance Bill was approved by the Government in 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission into the tragic death of the person concerned was published on the 10 March 2010.  The report found that there was insufficient evidence to support the allegation that the person in question was assaulted by Garda members during his arrest, and no credible evidence that he was mistreated in any way during his detention in Store Street Garda Station.  It also made a number of findings and recommendations regarding the presence of ligature suspension points in cells and the process required to ensure prisoners do not have access to ligatures while in custody.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner is carefully examining these recommendations.  Significant change has already occurred since this tragic death in 2005, and a number of the recommendations are already being progressed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in some cases have been implemented.  These include the following developments:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The installation of CCTV systems in Garda stations.  To date systems have been installed in ten stations with plans to install systems in a further five.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In 2008, following a survey by the Office of Public Works of cells and detention facilities in 40 Garda stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Region, a programme of upgrade works was commenced and is ongoing.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Guidance notes for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the regulations governing the treatment of persons in Garda custody have been extensively updated to incorporate recent legislative changes and other legal developments and to reflect best practice.  The regulations detail the authority for searching prisoners in Garda custody and the removal of cords, strings, belts etc., from clothing for detained persons.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A  leaflet containing &ldquo;Information for Persons in Custody&rdquo; is given to each detained person and clearly outlines their rights and entitlements as well as the procedures which will be followed by Garda&iacute; throughout the period of detention.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A revised Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Custody Record was issued in 2009 and provides for a risk assessment of each detained person as well as capturing more comprehensive detail on issues such as the condition of the detained person on arrival.  These extensions to the custody record are intended to enhance the rights and treatment of persons detained.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The operation of all these measures will be subject to ongoing monitoring and review as part of the consideration being given to the report&rsquo;s recommendations and in pursuance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s commitment to upholding and protecting the rights of all detained persons.</P>

	<P>On 13 July 2007 an inquest into this tragic death returned a verdict of suicide.  In the same month, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission decided in the public interest to carry out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death.  This was the first public interest investigation commenced by the Ombudsman Commission under Section 102 (4) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  On the 10th March 2010, the Commission published their report following this investigation.</P>
        <P>The report found that there was insufficient evidence to support the allegation that the person in question was assaulted by Garda members during his arrest, and no credible evidence that he was mistreated in any way during his detention in Store Street Garda Station.  It also made findings in relation to the presence of a ligature suspension point in the cell, and how the person in question had a ligature with him in the cell.  It also found that the recording of details of the custody fell below appropriate standards.  The report also made a number of valuable recommendations on improved cell safety and custody records which will be carefully considered by the Garda Commissioner.  In fact, many of the recommended changes were already under way and in some cases implemented prior to this report.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is fully independent in the exercise of its functions and has been charged by the Oireachtas with investigating tragic incidents of this kind.  Indeed, the Ombudsman Commission says in the report that it is satisfied that the report of the investigation and its review have been thorough, proportionate and independent.  I do not believe, in these circumstances, that a further inquiry would be justified.</P>

	<P>Section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 provides the legislative basis for the appointment of Peace Commissioners by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is open to anyone to seek nomination to this office and all such requests for appointment are considered by me.</P>
        <P>Section 19 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 vests the power to appoint notaries public and commissioners to administer oaths in the Chief Justice.  I understand that solicitors holding current practice certificates are entitled to act as Commissioner for Oaths.  In the case of Commissioners for Oaths, applicants who wish to be appointed a Commissioner for Oaths are appointed by the Chief Justice sitting in open court.  Applications are made by petition which must be verified by affidavit of the petitioner in which is exhibited a certificate of fitness generally signed by six local solicitors and six leaders of the local business community.</P>
        <P>The petition is brought before the Chief Justice by notice of motion which must be served through this office on:</P>
<P el="5">(a) the District Court Clerk for the applicant&rsquo;s district;</P>
<P el="5">(b) for Dublin only &mdash; The Law Society;</P>
<P el="5">(c) for all areas outside Dublin &mdash; the local Bar Association.</P><Col N="200"/>
<P FLI="0" el="5">In the case of Notaries Public, appointments are also made by the Chief Justice sitting in open court.  Applications are made by petition which must be verified by affidavit of the petitioner in which is exhibited a certificate of fitness generally signed by six local solicitors and six leaders of the local business community.</P>
        <P>The petition is brought before the Chief Justice by Notice of Motion which must be served through this office on:</P>
<P el="5">(a) The Registrar of the Faculty of Notaries Public in Ireland;</P>
<P el="5">(b) The Secretary Law Society of Ireland.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">The Petition may be moved by counsel or solicitor on the petitioner&rsquo;s behalf.  The general practice is to appoint only solicitors as notaries public.  When a person, who is not a solicitor, applies to be appointed a notary public, the Law Society will require that he give an undertaking to the Chief Justice not to engage in conveyancing or in legal work usually performed by a solicitor.</P>

	<P>The total travel and related costs incurred by me on my St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to Paris amounted to &euro;182.58, the cost of my scheduled flight.  Other than the normal Civil Service travel and subsistence rates which apply, there were no further costs to the exchequer as I stayed in the embassy residence for the duration of my visit and travelled to official functions using embassy or public transport.  Travel costs incurred by my spouse who accompanied me on the visit were covered personally.  To date, my Private Secretary&rsquo;s costs amount to &euro;182.58.</P>

	<P>It is not possible to provide the figures in the format requested by the Deputy as this would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified where there are other significant demands on resources.</P>
        <P>Prior to May 2008 seizure of drugs was recorded under the generic description &ldquo;prohibited articles&rdquo; and a detailed breakdown is not readily available.  From May  (when new security initiatives were first introduced) to 31 December 2008, there were 351 drug seizures within the Irish prison system and up to and including 13 September 2009, the date for which the most recent figures are available, there were 696 drug seizures within the Irish prison system in that year.  Final statistics for 2009 are currently being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy, once available.</P>
        <P>It is acknowledged that drugs present a major challenge to the Irish Prison Service and in this context, the Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy, entitled <i>Keeping Drugs out of Prison </i>was launched in May 2006<i>.</i>  The implementation of this Policy &amp; Strategy has seen an intensification of efforts in the prison system to eliminate the availability of illicit drugs within prisons.  The measures taken reflect the many and varied ways in which attempts are made to bring drugs into prisons and include:</P><Col N="202"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Tighter control and monitoring of prisoner visits in all closed prisons.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />New visiting arrangements in most closed prisons, with visitors required to be pre-approved by the Governor and required to provide identification on each visit.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Greater use of screened visits.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Greater vigilance in examining mail by prison censors and searching of other items entering the prison.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Increased random searching of cells and their occupants.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Stricter searching of all persons committed to custody and prisoners returning from court, temporary release, after visits or on receipt of intelligence.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Use of modern cameras and probe systems which assist in searching previously difficult areas such as hollow chair or bed legs, under floor boards and other cavities.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Installation of nets over exercise yards to prevent access to contraband items, including mobile phones and drugs.  Use of phone detectors and phased installation of telephone blocking technology.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, a number of new security initiatives have been introduced in all closed prisons including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The introduction of enhanced security screening for all persons (visitors and staff) entering our prisons.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Irish Prison Service involving approximately 30 handling teams.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of Operational Support Units dedicated to and developing expertise in searching and gathering intelligence on illicit material being hidden inside our prisons; they will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific security problem areas.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Body Orifice Security Scanner (BOSS) chair was introduced by the Irish Prison Service in early 2008 and to date eight chairs have been installed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The new security screening at prison entrances and the measures introduced have had considerable success in preventing the flow of and assisting in the capture of contraband such as illicit drugs.  The battle will be an ongoing one in which I an determined to take whatever practical measures are possible to thwart illegal activity.  There will be no easing off in relation to the security measures already in place and enhancements and improvements will continue to take place in the future.</P>
        <P>There is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss security issues and the Garda&iacute; will be contacted whenever any suspected criminal offence has taken place.  The Irish Prison Service continues to work to implement its Drugs Policy and Strategy, which also includes continued investment in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population as well as meeting prisoners&rsquo; treatment and rehabilitative needs.</P>

	<P>2010 marks the Bicentenary of the independence of Argentina. Given the long-standing and close bilateral ties which characterise relations between Ireland and Argentina, a wide ranging programme is being put in place to mark this significant anniversary in Argentina&rsquo;s history.</P>
        <P>The Irish Embassy in Buenos Aires launched its commemorative programme of Argentina&rsquo;s Bicentenary during the highly successful visit of the GAA Hurling All Stars to Buenos Aires in December 2009. Hurling, which was played by Irish immigrants to Argentina up to the late 1930s, and the visit by the GAA All Stars provided the nexus around which to celebrate the contribution of the Irish to Argentine agriculture, education and civic life as well as to reinforce the hurling connection.</P>
        <P>A highlight of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the celebration of the Bicentenary in Argentina will be the visit to Latin America in May/June the L.E. Niamh which will include a stopover in Argentina.  This visit offers an excellent opportunity to highlight and strengthen relations with <Col N="208"/>Argentina, where Foxford-born William Brown founded the Argentine Navy.  The Embassy is actively planning a number of events in Buenos Aires during the visit in the context of the Bicentenary.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the very important role Irish migrants have played in the history and development of Argentina over the last 200 years, a number of Embassy Buenos Aires 2010 cultural activities will focus on the theme of migration. This will include collaborating with the Southern Cross Newspaper, which celebrates its 135th anniversary this year, to present a special edition looking back at the history of the Irish-Argentine community over the last 200 years and sponsoring Irish community participation in Immigrant Day celebrations in September.</P>
        <P>In addition, with the assistance of the Cultural Section of the Department, the Embassy has programmed a number of other cultural events in Argentina this year as part of the centenary celebrations including Irish participation in the Buenos Aires International Festival of Literature and the Chopiniana music festival.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The first indication we received of the use of false Irish passports in connection with the killing of Mr. Mahmoud al Mabhouh was on 4 February, when local press reports in Dubai stated that several suspects were believed to have entered Dubai on Irish passports. The Ambassador of Ireland to the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Madden, immediately contacted the UAE Foreign Ministry to seek clarification as to the truth of these reports. On 8 February, Ambassador Madden was received at the UAE Foreign Ministry and was informed that they had no information at that time but that the matter was under investigation by the UAE&rsquo;s security services. </P>
        <P>On 15 February, the Dubai Chief of Police gave a news conference during which he gave the details of fake Irish passports. My Department, in cooperation with the Garda&iacute; and the security services, immediately commenced an investigation into the apparent use of fraudulent Irish passports, including by making contact with the Irish citizens whose passport numbers had been stolen. Ambassador Madden has maintained ongoing contact with the UAE Foreign Ministry and the Dubai Police, in addition to liaising with his German, French, Australian, Austrian and British counterparts. Ambassador Madden has met with the UAE Minister for Foreign Affairs to discuss the situation. The Dubai police have shared with us the details of <Col N="209"/>the fraudulent passports they suspect were used, and we have passed these on to the investigating Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>Our investigations are ongoing, and I do not yet have categorical proof of who was responsible for the counterfeit. However, we have noted the large number of media reports which have implicated the Israeli security services and the circumstantial evidence which supports this assumption. We have also noted the comments of the Dubai police and links to Israel in the case of the forged British, French, Australian and German passports used by the suspects.</P>
        <P>I met with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, in Brussels on 22 February to outline how seriously we take the misuse of Irish passports and to ask for the assistance of the Israeli authorities in establishing the facts of this case. The Israeli Minister said that he had no information on the matter. While in Brussels, I attended a meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, after which my EU colleagues and I issued a statement strongly condemning the fraudulent use of EU passports.</P>
        <P>In addition to meetings at political level, our Ambassador to Israel has met with the Europe Director of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and registered Ireland&rsquo;s serious concerns. The Israeli Ambassador to Ireland was invited to Iveagh House where senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs stressed the seriousness with which the Government viewed the matter.</P>
        <P>I have discussed the situation with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and we are cooperating closely and sharing information. Officials from our Embassies in Paris, London and Berlin have been in contact with the Foreign Ministries of those countries to ensure a coordinated response. Senior officials of my Department have also met on two occasions with the Australian Ambassador to Ireland and shared information with him.</P>
        <P>I have also discussed the matter with the UAE Foreign Minister, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed, and have assured him of Ireland&rsquo;s cooperation. The Attorney General took the opportunity presented by his St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to the UAE to discuss the issue with the Foreign Minister.</P>
        <P>In recent years, there has been very significant investment in enhancing the security features of the passport book to ensure that our citizens can travel in safety. It is significant that eight of the passports were counterfeit versions of the old Irish passport which was replaced in 2005 by the modern APS Irish passport. The older passports are gradually being phased out over the next 5 years. In addition, since October 2006, all new Irish passports have a biometric chip embedded in the personal details page. This makes them extremely difficult to reproduce and we have not experienced any credible attempt to reproduce the new version.</P>
        <P>Our primary focus in all of this has been to guarantee the security of the Irish citizens affected. There are now a total of eight false or falsely obtained Irish passports in question. We have spoken to all of the citizens who hold or have held passports with numbers provided by the Dubai authorities. We have provided them with new passports. On behalf of those individuals, and on behalf of all Irish passport holders, my Department is determined to uncover the truth of the situation. It is simply unacceptable that totally innocent citizens could have been placed in danger by the irresponsible actions of others.</P>

        <P>The North/South Bodies are a significant part of the architecture of the Good Friday Agreement and they deliver important public services for the island across a range of sectors.

	<P>As I have stated previously, since its opening in 1998, the Consulate General of Ireland in Edinburgh has maintained a wide-ranging <Col N="214"/>dialogue with the Scottish Government on issues. The Consul General remains in close contact with senior officials in the Scottish Government in relation to incidents of sectarianism of the kind referred to in the question. </P>
        <P>I understand that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to tackling sectarianism is carried out through several policy approaches, including education and the promotion of constructive dialogue within Scotland. Promoting Citizenship through Football was launched in December 2008 and is new a partnership between Scottish football and the Scottish Government which seeks to address this issue.</P>
        <P>The partnership is chaired by Mr. Gordon Smith, Chief Executive of the Scottish Football Association. The Scottish Premier League, the Scottish Football League, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and Sport Scotland are represented in this group. In addition, the Scottish Government has seconded an official to the Scottish Football Association to act as a single contact point for this group. The Consulate General has met with this partnership, and continues to monitor closely developments in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Scottish Government provides funding to a wide range of anti-sectarian and anti-racism initiatives, including Nil By Mouth, Sense Over Sectarianism, Show Racism the Red Card and others.</P>
        <P>In January 2010, the Scottish Government announced that it is funding an anti-sectarianism pilot programme in Scottish prisons. This March, Scottish Minister for Community Safety Fergus Ewing MSP reiterated that the Scottish Government is committed to tackling sectarianism wherever and whenever it occurs.</P>
        <P>The Consulate General will continue to maintain a dialogue with officials at the Scottish Government on issues relating to sectarianism.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 501 and 502 together. </P>
        <P>Accreditation of Irish Diplomatic Missions is decided on a number of criteria which include, inter alia, the provision of consular services. The Department regularly reviews its Diplomatic network of Embassies and Consulates abroad in this context. In addition, the Embassy of Ireland, Sofia, does not routinely deal with visa applications from Macedonia because Macedonia is accredited to the Embassy of Ireland, Bratislava.</P>
        <P>In 2008, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced an on line visa application facility for all Irish visa applications.</P><Col N="215"/>
        <P>Rollout of the online facility was completed in July, 2009. It is available worldwide through the website www.inis.gov.ie and provides detailed information on the application process including the documents required to support the application.</P>
        <P>The on line facility indicates the appropriate Irish Embassy, Consulate or Visa office in the applicant&rsquo;s country of residence or the Irish Mission to which their country is accredited to enable them to submit their application form and supporting documentation. In some cases where Ireland is neither resident nor has accreditation applicants are asked to submit their applications directly to INIS headquarters at Burgh Quay in Dublin.</P>
        <P>In countries where there is no Irish Embassy or Consulate a visa application may be submitted through the Honorary Consul network. Applicants may need to make an appointment with the Honorary Consul to ensure that the application and supporting documentation are in order before the application is transmitted to the appropriate Irish Embassy or Consulate. When the visa decision is made the Honorary Consul may also contact the applicant about collection to ensure that they receive their visa in good time as postal deliveries can be problematic in some regions.</P>
        <P>From time to time the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform may require individuals to attend for interview in order to clarify elements of their application. Applicants would be contacted by the relevant Irish Embassy, Consulate or Visa office in this regard.</P>
        <P>In the case of applicants from Macedonia, applications are made on line and submitted to the Embassy of Ireland Bratislava in Slovakia. If the visa is approved it is usually couriered back to the applicant in Macedonia. However arrangements can be made in advance with the Irish Embassy in Bratislava to have it collected from the Irish Embassy in Sofia.</P>
        <P>Ireland does not have a resident Embassy in Georgia</P>

        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if, in view of the travel advice for Israel and the Occupied Territories provided by his Department, it is still necessary to advise travellers to visit only in visits organised by reputable tourist groups in view of the fact that this advice may discourage independent travellers whose spending power can be of immense importance to smaller tourism providers in the region; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department&rsquo;s travel advice is regularly updated and is designed to help Irish citizens make informed decisions before travelling overseas. It reflects a considered assessment of the risks involved and is based on the best information available to the Department. It draws on reports from Irish Diplomatic and Consular Missions abroad and advice issued by other countries including Member States of the European Union, as well as other like minded countries. Every effort is made to ensure that the advice offered is accurate and up-to-date. </P>
        <P>The Department is not currently advising against travel to Israel and the Occupied Territories, except to the Gaza Strip, but is advising against non essential travel to the border area with the Gaza Strip. It is also advising citizens to exercise extreme caution before deciding to travel<b> </b>to the occupied West Bank, particularly in the light of the two fatal incidents in the West Bank over the weekend in which four Palestinians were killed. This advice also<b> </b>takes account of the current security situation, including the events which occurred on 18 March, when a mortar attack from Gaza on Israel resulted in the death of a farm worker.</P><Col N="216"/>
        <P>In addition, there have been disturbances in Jerusalem and in parts of the West Bank over the past week, and the threat level is considered such as to justify the retention of our current advice.</P>
        <P>As I am sure the Deputy will accept, the primary responsibility for undertaking a journey overseas, or for any decision taken against accepting our advice, rests with the individual.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that this Department will continue to monitor the situation closely and will remain in regular contact with the Israeli authorities.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the Goldstone report; if he will comment on his recent trip to Gaza; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have reported to the House on previous occasions, most recently on 11 February, I consider the Goldstone Report to be a serious and important contribution to efforts to determine the truth of allegations about events in Gaza a year ago, to establish accountability for them, and to seek to prevent a recurrence of such alleged infringements of international law. I have commended Judge Goldstone and his colleagues, including retired Defence Forces Colonel Desmond Travers, for their work. </P>
        <P>The UN General Assembly last November adopted a Resolution, supported by Ireland, which called on the parties to the conflict to report within three months on their implementation of the Resolution, and particularly the requirement to establish independent and transparent enquiries into allegations relating to the conduct of their forces during the conflict. On 4 February UN Secretary General Ban sent to the General Assembly the reports he had received from Israel and the Palestinian Authority. SG Ban noted at that stage that the reports do not provide enough information to be clear yet if the General Assembly Resolution has been complied with, or is in the process of being complied with.</P>
        <P>The UN General Assembly subsequently adopted on 26 February a follow-up Resolution on the Goldstone Report which renewed the call on all parties to establish and conduct credible and independent investigations to an international standard. Ireland was one of the 98 countries who voted in favour of this Resolution. The Resolution calls for a further report from the SG within a period of five months, by 26 July, on the implementation of the Resolution. Discussions are now also underway at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on follow up to the original Resolution adopted by the HRC last October, following publication of the Goldstone Report.</P>
        <P>Regarding my recent visit to Gaza, it had been my intention to travel to Gaza for some time &mdash; I had repeatedly expressed my serious concerns over the situation there and it was clearly important that I see for myself the full humanitarian consequences of the blockade imposed on the Strip. My visit was also an invaluable opportunity to examine the vital humanitarian work being undertaken by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza and which Irish Aid is actively supporting.</P>
        <P>The programme for my visit was drawn up in close collaboration with UNRWA and its Irish born Director of Operations, John Ging, and afforded me the opportunity to see the truly impressive work which UNRWA is performing in maintaining basic humanitarian services for the people of Gaza. Among the locations I visited were an UNRWA food distribution centre in Rafah and two UNRWA preparatory schools.</P><Col N="217"/>
        <P>I have stated clearly since visiting Gaza that the current conditions prevailing for the ordinary population in Gaza are inhumane and utterly unacceptable in terms of accepted international standards of human rights. The international community has to do very much more to bring the unacceptable humanitarian crisis in Gaza to an end. Eighty per cent of the population of Gaza now live below the poverty line and UNRWA are encountering increasing levels of abject poverty where people basically do not have enough food, even with their meagre food allocations, to live. This situation can not be allowed to continue, or deteriorate even further.</P>
        <P>At a meeting with EU High Representative Catherine Ashton and my fellow EU Foreign Ministers in Cordoba on 5 March I raised my full concerns regarding Gaza and I therefore very much welcome both the High Representative&rsquo;s visit to Gaza on 18 March as well as UN Secretary General Ban&rsquo;s visit on 21 March. These visits are contributing to maintain international attention on Gaza and are highlighting the difficulties faced on a daily basis by the population. I note that there has been some recent easing of restrictions by the Israeli authorities which has allowed in materials for 150 housing units, necessary work on the sewage treatment plant and on the flour mill, as well as some window glass and window and door frames. However welcome this easing of restrictions is, the only acceptable policy remains for a complete and lasting end to the blockade. I personally will continue to raise the intolerable situation in Gaza at EU and international level and to lend my support to efforts to end the blockade as soon as possible.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> if the respect for human rights and democratic principle enshrined in the EU and Israel Association Agreement is being shown by the State of Israel; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12670/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU-Israel Association Agreement forms the legal basis for relations between the EU and Israel. As the Deputy has indicated, Article 2 of this Agreement states that relations between the parties, as well as all the provisions of the Agreement itself, will be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of the Agreement. This respect for human rights is a fundamental element of the European Union&rsquo;s relations with all other states. </P>
        <P>Under the provisions of the current Association Agreement, there are procedures for raising human rights concerns directly with the Israeli authorities and these are regularly evoked alongside use of more regular diplomatic channels to make EU views on human rights issues known to the Israeli authorities. It is intended that these procedures will be strengthened in the near future through establishment of a dedicated sub-committee on human rights which will examine such issues as fundamental freedoms and the rights and protection of minorities.</P>
        <P>Within the EU, Ireland has long been among the most active Member States in ensuring that we convey our serious concerns about any breaches of international law and human rights abuses in the occupied territories to the Israeli Government at every opportunity. The EU has made it very clear to Israel particularly that settlement construction in the Occupied Territories, including East Jerusalem, is illegal under international law. The EU has repeatedly called on Israel to honour its commitments under the Road Map and other international agreements to freeze all settlement activity, including &ldquo;natural growth&rdquo;, and to dismantle outposts built since 2001.</P>
        <P>The EU has also repeatedly made clear its serious concerns, most recently in the Conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council last December, at the unacceptable and counter-pro<Col N="218"/>ductive blockade of Gaza, the policy of forced evictions and demolitions currently being applied in East Jerusalem, and continuing heavy restrictions on movement for Palestinians in the occupied territories. It is clear that the Israeli government must do a great deal more to improve the basic situation and living conditions on the ground for ordinary Palestinians, if the appropriate political environment is to be created for meaningful dialogue and progress towards resolution of final status issues and achievement of a negotiated two-State solution.</P>
        <P>In addition to existing EU statements on human rights concerns in the occupied territories, Ireland has taken a strong position regarding any proposed upgrading of EU relations with Israel. I made it clear to my EU colleagues on several occasions that events since the Israeli military operation in Gaza early last year means that there cannot be a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; approach to proceeding with the upgrade. I have consistently argued that account must be taken of overall developments in the peace process before the upgrade, which was postponed in June 2009, can go ahead.</P>

	<P>On 16 March, I had a very useful meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Washington. We discussed a broad range of foreign policy issues, including the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iran and Haiti. </P>
        <P>Secretary Clinton was particularly interested in the situation in Northern Ireland in the wake of the historic agreement at Hillsborough last month. I thanked the Secretary for her own personal engagement, not least during the two crucial weeks leading up to the agreement at Hillsborough. I also took the opportunity to express our appreciation to Secretary Clinton for the US Administration&rsquo;s continued support for the peace process and for the appointment of Declan Kelly as the US Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland, whose work on the economic dimension will help sustain the political progress.</P>
        <P>We had a very useful exchange on the issue of immigration reform and the operation of the working holiday visa agreement, which is a very important bilateral agreement in terms of maintaining engagement and linkage between young people in the U.S. and in Ireland.</P>
        <P>We discussed the scope for cooperation on development issues and agreed that the United States and Ireland will co-host an event highlighting global hunger, food security, and nutrition on the margins of the Millennium Development Goals Summit in New York next September.</P>
        <P>On the Middle East, I briefed the Secretary on my recent visit to Gaza and also assured her of our full support for the leadership being provided by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton to bring the parties closer to proximity talks under the expert guidance of Senator George Mitchell.</P>
        <P>The issue of pre-clearance at Shannon did not arise during my discussions with Secretary Clinton but my colleague the Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey T.D., has taken up this issue directly with Secretary Napolitano of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and has recently written to her on the subject.</P>

	<P>I have recently been made aware of the case raised by the Deputy through our Embassy in Riyadh. It appears that the young woman involved has dual Indian-Canadian citizenship. She travelled to Saudi Arabia two years <Col N="220"/>ago with a temporary holiday visa, sponsored by her father who is an Indian citizen resident in Saudi Arabia. Under Saudi law, the sponsor&rsquo;s permission is required for any foreigner who wishes to obtain an exit visa in order to leave Saudi Arabia. As I understand it, the twenty four year old&rsquo;s father is now refusing to grant her permission to leave the country and has confiscated both of her passports. Under Saudi law, a father maintains full legal control over the daughters in his family until that control is passed on to a husband upon marriage (reports locally indicate that there is a family dispute in relation to Ms. Quazi&rsquo;s marriage plans). Unfortunately it is for the Saudi authorities to issue the necessary exit visa for her to leave the country. </P>
        <P>As the young person travelled on her Indian passport, the Indian Embassy in Riyadh has primary responsibility to assist her. I understand that she has also been in contact with the Canadian Embassy and Human Rights Watch has taken up her case with the Canadian authorities. We will continue to monitor any progress made on this case through our Embassy.</P>

	<P>International election monitoring missions have an important role to play in the promotion of human rights and democracy. We therefore aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is appropriately represented in international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums. Over the past six years, Ireland has been represented in 90 election observation missions worldwide. This has involved the participation of a total of 512 Irish observers. The missions involved have primarily been organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Ireland has also been represented in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre. </P>
        <P>Through Irish Aid, the Government&rsquo;s aid programme, the Department of Foreign Affairs maintains a roster of volunteers for election monitoring missions. There are currently some 280 volunteers on the roster. They all have either overseas or domestic experience in the administration of elections, or have significant overseas development expertise. Their place on the roster is based on the date of their last participation in a mission.</P>
        <P>When a request for electoral observation is received, the Department contacts suitably qualified volunteers, taking into account their place on the roster and any specific criteria for the mission, including relevant language proficiency. Following completion of the internal selection process, a draft list of nominees is submitted for Ministerial approval. The roster is updated as each mission is completed, to ensure that all registered volunteers have an opportunity to participate in a mission.</P>
        <P>In the case of European Union election observation missions, all candidate observers must register with the European Commission as well as with Irish Aid. The final selection of observers rests with the Commission, based on an approved list submitted by Irish Aid.</P>
        <P>I believe the selection procedure is working well, and there are no plans at present to change it. However, as with all activities supported by Irish Aid, the election observation programme is under continuous monitoring to ensure that it operates efficiently and effectively and provides the best possible value for money.</P><Col N="221"/>
        <P>I regret that, as a consequence of industrial action, I am not in a position at this stage to provide the list of people who have participated in election monitoring missions since 2003. I will ensure that the information is provided to the Deputy as soon as this is possible.</P>

	<P>Waterways Ireland operates a sponsorship programme with the aim of promoting recreation and increasing the number of people using the inland waterways under its remit.</P>
        <P>I am informed that the call for applications to the 2010 sponsorship programme is now closed. The deadline for receipt of sponsorship applications was 17 December 2009. The programme was advertised in the local and national media in September 2009. Over 100 applications were received and I am advised that the assessment process is now almost complete.</P>
        <P>The sponsorship programme has been very successful to date in attracting new users to the waterways and showcasing what the waterways have to offer.</P>
        <P>Details of sponsorship funding in 2007, 2008 and 2009 are set out in the Table.  Sponsorship amounts paid in sterling in Northern Ireland are shown as the equivalent euro amount.</P>

	<P>Over the lifetime of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP), funding of &euro;54.2m is available under the Village Renewal and Development Measure. Actions under this Measure are aimed at enhancing the environmental, amenity and surface structural aspects of communities and they complement other Axis 3 measures, particularly those targeting tourism and conservation of the local heritage. All actions under this Measure involving public areas must be agreed with the relevant local authority.</P><Col N="229"/>
        <P>Eligible activities under this Measure include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Environmental upgrading (such as upgrading parks, civic areas, river walks, etc);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Access facilities to amenities;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Public utilities such as street lighting (but excluding water, sewage and major road works);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />General appearance upgrading (such as ornamental paving, street art, ornamental lighting, etc) and renovation of relevant derelict buildings (excluding traditional farm buildings, which will be eligible for support under Axis 2); and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Farmers&rsquo; markets.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Both individuals/private companies and community groups are eligible to apply for funding under this Measure. Individuals/private companies are eligible for 50% support with a maximum grant of up to &euro;150,000 (with the exception of &ldquo;Analysis and Development&rdquo; work, which may receive 75% support with a maximum grant of &euro;30,000).  In exceptional circumstances, and subject to the prior written approval of my Department, grant aid of up to &euro;200,000 may be awarded to projects.</P>
        <P>Community organisations are eligible for grant aid of up to 75% with a maximum grant of up to &euro;150,000 (with the exception of &ldquo;Analysis and Development&rdquo; work, which may receive 90% support with a maximum grant of &euro;30,000).  In exceptional circumstances, and subject to the prior written approval of my Department, grant aid of up to &euro;500,000 is available to non-commercial community projects.</P>
        <P>A number of Local Action Groups (LAGs) have been contracted by my Department to deliver the RDP. In this context, my Department has issued a set of operating rules to each group, based on the EU Regulations which govern the programme.</P>
        <P>In line with the bottom-up nature of the RDP, the Deputy should note that the LAG is the principal decision-maker in relation to the allocation of project funding to individual applicants. Funding decisions are made by the LAG, following extensive evaluation and approval processes in the context of its local strategy and in line with the operating rules and EU Regulations. To date, expenditure of some &euro;796,000 has been registered under this Measure and a further &euro;1.5m of project commitments is in train.</P>
        <P>Groups or individuals interested in applying for funding under the RDP should contact their local LAG for further information.</P>

As above, the definitive costs have yet to be finalised.  With regard to the transportation costs of &pound;97, it may be noted that this arose in the context of the necessary transportation being provided by the Irish Embassy in London. The amount related to overnight costs for the Embassy driver and represented a substantial saving in comparison to the cost of using a hired car.</P>

	<P>In the court case referred to by the Deputy, the High Court found that the Irish State is in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights in not having a process and a register to legally recognise the acquired gender of transsexual persons. The judgment, however, allows the State a degree of latitude in the design of mechanisms to give such legal recognition.</P>
        <P>The Renewed Programme for Government which was published in October 2009 contained a commitment to introduce legal recognition of the acquired gender of transsexuals. Accordingly, the appeal to the Supreme Court is not being pursued and an interdepartmental committee is currently being established to consider all of the issues involved.</P>
        <P>The committee will commence its deliberations within the next few weeks.</P>

	<P>The objective of the back to education allowance scheme is to equip people on social welfare payments with qualifications that will enable them to obtain employment in the labour market. The scheme covers courses of education from second level to Higher Diploma level in any discipline [level 8 in the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)] and to a Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary and Secondary Teaching; level 9 in NFQ) which add significantly to a person&rsquo;s employability. Other postgraduate qualifications such as a Master&rsquo;s (level 9) or Doctoral degrees (level 10) are not included.</P>
        <P>A small number of cases have arisen where a college has granted an exemption from the requirement to hold a primary degree and has admitted a person to a Master&rsquo;s course on the <Col N="232"/>basis of relevant life experience. In the context of the ongoing review of the operation of the scheme, it was decided to extend entitlement to back to education allowance in these instances on an exceptional basis.</P>
        <P>The nature and structure of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 536, 537, 606 and 607 together.</P>
        <P>The provisions and procedures governing the registration of deaths in Ireland are contained in Part 5 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 and these are as follows: Where a death occurs in the State it is the duty of a qualified informant (normally a relative of the deceased) to attend at a registrar&rsquo;s office and register the death on foot of a certificate of cause of death supplied by a registered medical practitioner. Where a death is referred to a coroner, the death is registered by a registrar on foot of a coroner&rsquo;s certificate.</P>
        <P>In general, only deaths which occur within the State are registerable. Exceptions apply under the provisions of section 39 of the Act, concerning:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Deaths of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Permanent Defence Force or of the spouse or specified members of the family of such member, outside the State while the member is serving outside the State as such member,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Deaths of persons on board an Irish aircraft or Irish ship,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Deaths of Irish citizens on board a foreign ship or a foreign aircraft travelling to or from a port, or an airport, as the case may be, in the State.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Where the death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State occurs abroad, the death may be registered here if there was not at the time of the death a system of registration of deaths in the place where the death occurred, or such a system that applied to such a death, or it is not <Col N="233"/>possible to obtain copies of or extracts from civil records of the death ie. a death certificate. Although the number of such cases is extremely small, it is considered reasonable to make provision for them.</P>
        <P>Usually, when an Irish citizen dies abroad, the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred, and a certified copy of the death registration is obtainable. This certificate, translated, if necessary, is normally sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes here and there is therefore no necessity for the death to be registered in the State.</P>
        <P>The reasoning behind these provisions is simply to ensure that where deaths cannot be registered abroad, they can be registered here and that in all cases the relatives of the deceased have available to them a certificate of the death for personal, legal and administrative purposes.</P>
        <P>Any broadening of these provisions will require careful consideration particularly  in view of the large numbers of people who live in other countries and who have or are entitled to have Irish citizenship. However, this matter will be reviewed in the context of future amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.</P>

	<P>Diffuse idiopathic hyperostosis is a type of arthritis characterised by calcification along the sides of the vertebrae. The Department does not operate any income support scheme specifically aimed at persons who have that or any other particular illness. A range of income support payments is provided for people who are ill or have a disability. These include the insurance based schemes Illness Benefit and Invalidity Pension and the means-tested Disability Allowance. Detailed information on these schemes and other supports provided by the Department are available on the website www.welfare.ie or via the Department&rsquo;s network of Local Offices.</P>

	<P>The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Fuel allowance is payable for 32 weeks a year. The standard allowance <Col N="237"/>is &euro;20 a week while the rate in smokeless zones is &euro;23.90 a week.   The scheme benefits almost 318,000 people a year at an estimated cost of &euro;217 million in 2009.</P>
        <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances that have special heating needs e.g. in the case of ill health, infirmity or a medical condition.  In order to qualify for a heating supplement, the claimant must live alone or only with a qualified adult or child and satisfy the standard means test for receipt of Supplementary Welfare Allowance. The heating supplement may be paid to an individual in addition to a fuel allowance, depending on the circumstances of the individual.</P>
        <P>Applications for heating supplement should be made to the appropriate community welfare officer who will examine the person&rsquo;s entitlement based on his or her personal circumstances.</P>

	<P>The rent supplement scheme provides short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P>The rent supplement scheme is administered on behalf of the Department by the Community Welfare Service Division of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. There are over 94,000 people in receipt of rent supplement of which over 34,000 are getting a supplement for 18 months or more. The number of rent supplement recipients has increased by 27% since the end of December 2008.</P>
        <P>A person may be eligible for rent supplement if the accommodation is suitable to their needs, the rent is below the maximum rent level set for your county and the person is assessed in the last 12 months by a local authority as being eligible for and in need of social housing; living in accommodation for homeless people for 6 months (183 days) out of the last 12 months; living in private rented accommodation for 6 months (183 days) out of the last 12 months; or a tenant of accommodation provided under one of the Social Housing Schemes and the person satisfies a habitual residence test and a means test.</P>
        <P>Under standard assessment rules, rent supplement entitlement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;24, which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. The rent supplement means test provides for a gradual withdrawal of the supplement as hours of employment or earnings increase. Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of this excess is disregarded, with 25% of remaining excess s also disregarded for means assessment purposes.</P>
        <P>Applications for rent supplement should be made to the appropriate local community welfare officers who will examine the person&rsquo;s entitlement based on his or her personal circumstances.</P>

	<P>There are over 620 staff working in areas related to control of fraud and abuse of the welfare system. As part of its control strategy the Department carries out detailed fraud &amp; error surveys on individual schemes which provide evidence-based indicators of the levels of fraud &amp; error for those schemes at that particular time. The level of fraud on most schemes is very low. The percentage of expenditure resulting from fraud identified in the Department&rsquo;s Fraud and Error surveys ranged from 0% for pensioners, to 0.1% for Illness Benefit, 0.8% for the Family Income Supplement, 1.8% for Child Benefit, 2.3% for the Disability Allowance and 6.4% for the One Parent Family Payment.</P><Col N="239"/>
        <P>In relation to savings in 2009, the Department recorded control savings of nearly &euro;484m. It must be noted that control activity was being focused on prevention of fraud and error at claim application stage. Savings made from the detection of bogus claims at application stage are not included in the Departments overall savings as the claim will not go into payment. However, this is the most cost effective mechanism of reducing losses through fraud and error in social welfare schemes. The number of criminal prosecutions in relation to social welfare fraud finalised in court for years 2000 to end February 2010 is set out in the tabular statement:</P>

        <Quest> where the money necessary for the proposed once-off bonus payment relating to auto-enrolment pensions, as described by the recently launched national pensions framework, will come. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The recently published National Pensions Framework is the Government&rsquo;s plan for future pension reform. It encompasses all aspects of pensions, from social welfare to private occupational pensions and public sector pension reform. Development of the framework was informed by the range of views raised during the comprehensive consultation process which followed publication of the <Col N="243"/>Green Paper on Pensions.  The aim of the framework is to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State. It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and to ensure that state support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.</P>
        <P>At present only 50% of workers have a private pension, with low levels of coverage among moderate to middle incomes a particular concern. While the State Pension is expected to provide sufficient retirement income for the lowest paid workers, most people will have a significant income gap if they do not have some extra private pension provision. Inertia and procrastination are among the main reasons for not taking out a pension. A key element of the framework is the introduction of a new auto-enrolment system which provides a way of overcoming this problem.</P>
        <P>Employees earning above a certain income threshold will be automatically enrolled into this new scheme, with the employee, their employer and the State all making contributions. Those employees already in a more favourable occupational pension scheme will not be enrolled.</P>
        <P>For those who are included in the scheme, contributions will only be paid on earnings above a certain minimum level and below a certain maximum. The level of these thresholds will be decided closer to the implementation date and they will be set in such a way as to ensure that the scheme focuses on those on low and middle incomes.</P>
        <P>Within these thresholds, the employee will pay 4% of their salary, with this being topped up by 2% from their employer and a further 2% by the State. The State&rsquo;s contribution will therefore be equivalent to 33% tax relief. The same 33% State contribution will apply to existing occupational and personal pension schemes and will replace the current system of tax relief at the standard and higher rates. This will represent a major increase in State support for the pensions of lower paid workers.</P>
        <P>Employees will be able to opt out of the scheme after a period of 3 months. While they will be automatically re-enrolled every 2 years, they can opt out again if they wish. As an additional incentive to encourage people to remain in the scheme, the Government has decided that a once-off bonus payment will be paid, to people who stay in the scheme for 5 years without a break in contributions.</P>
        <P>An implementation group is being established to develop the legislation, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to introduce the auto-enrolment scheme, including in relation to the once off payment, and the other elements of the framework. We expect the implementation phase to take three to five years to complete.  It is intended that the auto-enrolment scheme will be introduced in 2014 but the Government will review the introduction date depending on the prevailing economic conditions closer to the time.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are currently just under 90,000 lone parents in receipt of the One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) at an estimated cost in 2009 of &euro;1,113 million.  When other related supports and entitlements are taken into account, including Child Benefit and, where appropriate, the Rent Supplement and the Family Income Supplement, total expenditure in this area exceeds &euro;2 billion.</P>
        <P>Despite this significant State spending on one-parent families as well as improvements made to the One Parent Family Payment over the years, the results have been poor in terms of tackling poverty and social exclusion and of encouraging economic independence.  A large proportion of lone parents and their children continue to experience poverty.</P>
        <P>The Government believes that the current arrangements, whereby a lone parent can receive the One-Parent Family Payment until their child is 18 &mdash; or 22 if in full-time education &mdash; <Col N="246"/>without any requirement for them to engage in employment, education or training, are not in the best interests of the recipient, their children or society.</P>
        <P>In general, the best route out of poverty is through paid employment.  It is recognised that work, and especially full-time work, may not be an option for parents of young children.  However, it is believed that supporting parents to participate in the labour market, once their children have reached an appropriate age, will improve both their own economic situation and the social well-being of themselves and their families.</P>
        <P>My Department has undertaken a comprehensive review of the One-Parent Family Payment and developed proposals that are designed to: prevent long-term dependence on welfare and facilitate financial independence; recognise parental choice with regard to care of young children but with the expectation that parents will not remain outside of the labour force indefinitely, and include an expectation of participation in education, training and employment, with supports provided in this regard.</P>
        <P>To meet these social policy objectives, the Government is considering various options for limiting the length of time for which the One-Parent Family Payment can be paid (including the age of the youngest child).  Any such changes would be phased in over a number of years for existing recipients to enable lone parents to access education and training and to prepare them for their return to the labour market.</P>
        <P>The changes will also bring Ireland&rsquo;s support for lone parents more into line with international provisions, where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.  The EU countries achieving the best outcomes in terms of tackling child poverty are those that are combining strategies aimed at facilitating access to employment and enabling services (e.g. child care) with income support.</P>
        <P>The Government is conscious that many lone parents will need access to education, training and activation measures in order to acquire the skills they will need to gain employment.  My Department has been working closely with other agencies to ensure that the broader needs of lone parent families are met and that the changes to the One-Parent Family Payment that are currently being finalised will be progressed in that context.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The objective of the back to work education allowance is to equip people on social welfare payments with qualifications that will enable them to obtain employment in the labour market.  The scheme is a second chance educational opportunities scheme for people on welfare payments who wish to participate in full-time education and who would not otherwise be able to do so.  Participation is open <Col N="247"/>to recipients of a range of welfare payments, including Jobseekers, One Parent Family, Disability, Illness and Caring schemes.</P>
        <P>The back to education allowance is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for the scheme.  It is not means-tested and income from part-time work while on the back to education allowance does not affect the basic payment.  In addition, an annual cost of education allowance of &euro;500 is payable.</P>
        <P>The back to education allowance has an important role to play in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers.  The nature and structure of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.</P>

	<P>The 2000 White Paper on Defence and the earlier Defence Force Review Implementation Plan both identified the requirement to address the high age profile in the Defence Forces.  The key element in military life is the need for personnel to maintain a level of fitness for combat readiness.  This requirement must be balanced with the need to retain experience and expertise, particularly at managerial level in the Defence Forces.  The upper age limit for enlistment in the Army is under 25 years of age on the date of enlistment and for the Naval Service it is under 27 years of age on the date of enlistment.  These limits are determined on the basis that the essential functions of <Col N="249"/>the Permanent Defence Force requires that its members be composed of able-bodied personnel of an age which is commensurate with the functional requirements of the organisation.</P>
        <P>The age profile of personnel recruited for general service into the Defence Forces in 2009 and over the past 10 years is presented in the Tabular Statement.</P>
	    <P>I am satisfied that the existing age requirements for recruitment to the Defence Forces are appropriate and I do not propose to make any changes in this area at this time. </P>

	<P>The premises leased by my Department for use by the Reserve Defence Forces are outlined in the tabular statement.  Rents paid for these premises are based on a number of factors including size, location and quality of the facilities and vary considerably.  Information on the leases and individual rents paid in respect of these premises is commercially sensitive and therefore not available.  However, the requirements of the RDF are reviewed annually and every effort is made on an ongoing basis to reduce costs.  In this connection, expenditure by my Department on such facilities reduced from &euro;196,128 in 2006 down to &euro;140,479 in 2008 and &euro;92,500 for 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>The Taoiseach and Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In July 2009, the Government approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Swedish-led Nordic Battlegroup 2011.  The Nordic Battlegroup 2011 will be on standby for 6 months commencing on the 1st January 2011.  To date Ireland has deployed four Officers to serve in staff posts at the Force Headquarters in Enkoping, Sweden and these officers took up their duties on the 28th August 2009.</P>
        <P>The Nordic Battlegroup 2011 has not undertaken any military exercises to date.  Consequently, no costs have been incurred by the Department of Defence in respect of this Battlegroup.</P>
        <P>Due to industrial action it has not been possible to compile the costs of the training exercises conducted with the Nordic Battlegroup 2008 in Sweden and the Minister will communicate further with the Deputy when this information is to hand.</P>

        <Quest> if he has received correspondence from the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces regarding work place complaints of bullying and <Col N="252"/>harassment by members of the Army nursing services; the reason he has failed to respond to this correspondence to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>The Taoiseach and Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I can confirm that correspondence has been received from the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces in relation to the matter referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that in the case of a serving member of the Defence Forces an action may only be investigated by the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces where a complaint regarding that action was first made under section 114 of the Defence Act 1954.  Section 290 of the Defence Act, 1954 which deals with the application of the Act to members of the ANS, specifies the relevant sections of the Act which are applicable to a member of the ANS, one of which is not section 114.</P>
        <P>Members of the Army Nursing Service (ANS) have recourse to a Redress of Wrongs Process under Section 19 of Defence Force Regulation A14.  Members of the ANS may if they so choose opt to join a trade union and in that context they are entitled to avail of the full range of industrial relations machinery which is available to employees generally.  The availability of access to union membership and consequently to redress through normal industrial relations machinery to members of the ANS is the reason why the ANS is excluded from seeking redress through the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>With regard to the particular alleged complaint the member of the ANS involved lodged a formal complaint dated 25th May 2009 with the military authorities which has been the subject of ongoing investigation.  Representations were also received on behalf of the individual from the Industrial Relations Officer of the Irish Nurses Organisation (INO).</P>
        <P>As the investigation was ongoing for some time holding responses to the correspondence from the Ombudsman were issued and a status update on the case was requested from the military authorities.  This was received on 12th February 2010 and a detailed response is currently being prepared which will be issued to the office of the Ombudsman.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>The Taoiseach and Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 614 to 617, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Tender competitions for defensive equipment for the Defence Forces are conducted by the Department of Defence in accordance with EU procurement guidelines.  For procurements of defensive equipment in excess of &euro;1 million, the European Defence Agency (EDA) Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement is observed and competitions are advertised on the EDA Electronic Bulletin Board.  Tender competitions are held in accordance with the EU Code of Conduct on Export Controls.  Accordingly, competitions are open to any individual or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargoes or restrictions.  To properly follow these guidelines and codes, the Department of Defence must deal impartially with all companies that are entitled to enter its procurement competitions and must evaluate tenders on the basis of objective criteria.</P>
        <P>A number of Israeli companies have won orders for defensive equipment in recent years as a result of tender competitions.  Since 2005, the Department has purchased small arms ammunition, X-Ray equipment for Explosive Ordnance Disposal duties (EOD), helmets for personal protection, an Artillery Fire Control System, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly referred to as UAVs, and a Surveillance and Target Acquisition Suite from Israeli suppliers.  The total value of defensive equipment acquired or being acquired from Israeli companies since 2005 is in the region of &euro;13.9 million, inclusive of VAT.  In each case, the main contract was awarded by tender competition, conducted impartially in compliance with the codes and guidelines set out above, on the basis that the company concerned had submitted the best tender.</P>
        <P>The order for the Surveillance and Target Acquisition suite was placed with Elbit Systems Limited last year.  The order is for the supply of surveillance equipment for four out of a total of twenty-seven Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles that are being supplied this year by BAE Systems in South Africa.  The order was placed following a tender competition and has a value of &euro;2.37 million inclusive of VAT.  The four Surveillance and Target Acquisition Suites are required to enhance the capability of the Defence Forces to carry out overseas Peace Support Operations.  They will be used as an information-gathering asset and will provide a means to enhance force protection and the safety of Irish troops whilst on such missions.  There is no order placed with an Israeli company for troop carriers.</P>
        <P>In addition, an order for two additional portable mini-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems, commonly referred to as UAVs, was placed in late 2009 with Aeronautics Defence Systems Limited from Israel.  The value of the order is the region of &euro;1.7 million, inclusive of VAT.  The initial delivery of UAV systems, with a value of &euro;0.958 million inclusive of VAT, took place at the end of 2007 following a tender competition.  The UAV systems were acquired to enhance the capability of the Defence Forces to carry out surveillance and target acquisition for overseas Peace Support Operations.  The UAVs have the capability to provide a low cost and low risk means to increase capabilities and enhance force protection by performing missions without requiring or risking the use of manned aircraft.  The UAVs are an information-gathering asset and are unarmed.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks the Department initiated a tender competition for 5.56 mm ammunition.  The tender competition is ongoing and tender proposals have not yet been submitted in respect of this competition.  The Department of Defence has no information at this stage as to what companies will submit such tender proposals.</P>
        <P>As I have already outlined above, the principle of competitive tendering for Government contracts has to be used by the Department of Defence for the acquisition of defensive equipment for the Defence Forces.  Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders.  Such tender competitions <Col N="254"/>are open to any individual company or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargoes or restrictions.  There are no such restrictions or embargoes in place on Israel or Israeli companies.</P>
        <P>The matter of a general trade embargo on Israel raises implications for foreign policy.  The Irish Government has consistently been opposed to proposals for trade, diplomatic, cultural, academic, sporting or other boycotts of Israel.  In the absence of a general trade embargo of Israel, the Department of Defence cannot unilaterally preclude Israeli companies from participating in tender competitions.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose for the procurement of defensive equipment by the Department of Defence is to enhance the capability of the Irish Defence Forces on overseas Peace Support Operations and to afford the greatest possible force protection to Irish troops whilst on such missions.</P>

	<P>Following concerns arising in relation to work undertaken on behalf of the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government at the ISPAT site, as a purely precautionary measure, an independent investigation of any potential health issues arising at the Naval Base in Haulbowline was undertaken in 2008.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive and detailed assessment of soil, sediment and air quality was carried out to assess any potential risks posed to human health.  The initial report by the Independent consultants was completed and the report concluded that any risk arising within the Naval Base falls within the acceptable range, meaning that there is no exposure to undue risks and that no mitigating action needs to take place.  I wish to state clearly that there is no unacceptable risk posed to personnel at the Naval Base and this is clearly supported by the independent assessment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 621 to 623, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Under the Building Energy Rating (BER) scheme, all dwellings are assessed against a standard calculation methodology know as DEAP (Dwelling Energy Assessment Procedure).  DEAP software calculates both energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by taking account of a wide range of factors including the dwelling&rsquo;s construction type, orientation, insulation levels, heating system, quality of the windows, doors, floors, lighting, ventilation, air tightness, etc.</P>
        <P>In terms of energy efficiency, wood chip boilers would generally achieve an efficiency of 80% whereas, for example, modern oil condensing boilers can achieve efficiency levels of 93%.  In contrast to this, the wood chip boiler performs significantly better than the oil boiler in terms of carbon dioxide emissions.   The wood chip boiler also has an advantage where newly built dwellings are concerned in terms of assisting with meeting the mandatory requirement under Part L of the Building Regulations 1997-2009 to source a reasonable proportion of energy from renewable energy sources.</P>
        <P>The database of BER activity maintained by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland does not distinguish between privately or publicly owned dwellings. My Department is not therefore in a position to supply the requested statistical information in full.  However, the available data are being compiled and will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The issue of potential health effects of mobile phone masts was comprehensively covered by the Expert Group Report entitled Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields published by Government in March 2007.</P>
        <P>The Expert Group Report examined a wide range of issues in relation to the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields, including those produced by mobile phone base stations. It answers many of the health risk questions raised by the public in relation to the potential effects of electromagnetic fields. The Report and its recommendations were accepted by the Government and form the basis for current policy in this area.</P>
        <P>The majority scientific opinion is that to date no adverse short or long term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). However, a minority group of scientists believe otherwise and extensive international research continues to be coordinated through bodies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO). This research is co-funded by the Irish Government.</P>
        <P>The ICNIRP Guidelines on exposure limits have been recommended by the European Commission to its Member States and are applied here in Ireland as part of the standard licensing conditions set down by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) for the telecommunications industry. The results from the emission measurements commissioned by ComReg at 750 sites to date have shown compliance with the ICNIRP Guidelines with values that were typically hundreds of times below the limits.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s current advice to those living in close proximity to mobile phone base stations, based on the conclusions of the Expert Group Report, is that there is no scientific basis for, or evidence of, adverse health effects in children or adults as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields.  This applies irrespective of the location of the phone mast.</P>

	<P>The primary responsibility for the management of any waste, including costs for removal or disposal, lies with the holder of the waste, i.e. the natural or legal person in possession of the waste, or the producer of the waste. The Waste Management Acts impose a general duty of care on holders of waste.  A person may not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. Environmental pollution is widely defined in the Act to include adversely affecting the countryside or places of interest. Persons who contravene this general duty are guilty of an offence and may be prosecuted by the local authority.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Waste Management (Prohibition of Waste Disposal by Burning) Regulations 2009, prohibit a holder of waste from disposing of it by burning. An exception is provided in Regulation 5 of these Regulations for certain types of waste, such as tree trimmings, leaves or brush generated by agricultural practices, where burning is permitted provided it is done as a final measure following the application, where practicable, of the following waste hierarchy:</P>
<P el="5">i. waste arisings are reduced in accordance with best agricultural practice,</P>
        <P el="5">ii. waste is reused,</P>
        <P el="5">iii. waste is recycled through shredding and use as compost or wood chippings,</P>
        <P el="5">iv. waste is salvaged for use as fuel.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Where none of the non-combustion disposal options are practicable or economically viable the waste may be disposed of by burning subject to certain conditions being fulfilled:</P>
        <P el="5">i. the person carrying out the disposal must take all reasonable measures to limit the overall nuisance or possibilities for endangering human health or causing environmental pollution or damage to adjoining hedgerows or habitats,</P>
        <P el="5">ii. no accelerants may be used when undertaking the disposal activity, and</P>
        <P el="5">iii. the person carrying out the disposal must notify the local authority concerned in advance of the intention to dispose by burning.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 636 and 637 together.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter PD 1/08 on Taking in Charge of Residential Developments/Management Arrangements states that planning authorities must take all necessary measures, in particular through securing adequate bonds, inspection of construction and enforcement action when necessary, to ensure that developers complete residential developments to a standard that is in compliance with the planning permission granted.</P>
        <P>In relation to bonds, the circular states that in the case of residential development, planning conditions must require the giving of sufficient security prior to commencement of development and that planning authorities must ensure that they are in a position to draw down the security in cases where a developer fails satisfactorily to complete a residential development, or phase of a development, within the specified period.</P>
        <P>The circular states that the amount of the security, and the terms on which it is required to be given, must enable the planning authority, without cost to itself, to complete the necessary services (including roads, footpaths, water mains, sewers, lighting and open space) to a satisfactory standard in the event of default by the developer and that the security condition must also provide for the recalculation of the amount specified in the condition by reference to the House Building Cost Index (or the Consumer Price Index) if the development to which the permission relates is not commenced within a specified period after the granting of the permission.</P>
        <P>The circular also states that where a development is completed in accordance with the planning permission the security should be released without undue delay.</P>
        <P>The developer of a residential estate is statutorily required to complete this development in accordance with the terms of the planning permission.  A development which has not been completed in accordance with the planning permission is unauthorised development.  Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authority, which can take action where a development requiring planning permission has not obtained this permission, or where permission has not been complied with.  Planning authorities have substantial obligations under the Planning and Development Act 2000 in relation to enforcement of planning control.</P>
        <P>Insofar as residential developments are concerned, Circular Letter PD 1/08 requests planning authorities to inspect such developments during construction and on completion or expiration of the planning permission with a view to taking appropriate enforcement action where the planning permission is not being complied with.</P>
        <P>Circular Letter PD 1/08 is referenced in my Department&rsquo;s Planning Guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas (Cities, Towns and Villages) of May 2009.  These are statutory guidelines issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, and planning authorities are required to have regard to them in exercising their functions under the Act. A copy of the guidelines is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.</P>

	<P>In October 2008 I established an Expert Advisory Group to carry out a review of Ireland&rsquo;s Tentative List of potential properties for nomination for inscription on the World Heritage List. The Expert Advisory Group (EAG) completed an extensive analysis of the properties on the cur<Col N="263"/>rent Tentative List.  Members of the public and interested groups were also invited to submit potential properties for inclusion on the new Tentative List. 31 such proposals were received and these were considered and assessed by the EAG.</P>
        <P>On the basis of the Expert Advisory Group&rsquo;s own analysis, and its consideration and assessment of the proposals received from the public and interested groups, a draft new Tentative List was published for public consultation between 2 November 2009 and 23 December 2009. The List contained the details of the properties which the EAG considered were of outstanding universal value, met the UNESCO World Heritage inscription criteria in terms of integrity and authenticity, and had the best potential for future inscription on the World Heritage List.</P>
        <P>Cashel was included on the draft new Tentative List within the Royal Sites of Ireland. Possible future discoveries at properties included within the Royal Sites of Ireland, such as those referred to in the Question, have the potential to add to the outstanding universal value of these sites.</P>
        <P>54 submissions were received during the public consultation period on the draft new Tentative List.  Each property on the draft new Tentative List has been re-examined by the EAG with regard to the submissions received and the UNESCO Tentative List Submission Format. The EAG has now finalised a new Tentative List which has been submitted to me. I expect to be in a position to approve the new Tentative List shortly with a view to submission to UNESCO.</P>

The membership of both boards has been standardised to enable them to act as one in advance of the legislation.  An organisation structure has been developed for the new organisation, and it, along with a number of practical HR issues, are the subject of ongoing dialogue with staff representatives.</P>

        <P>Preparatory work on the legislative amendments required to underpin the formal merger of the Rent Tribunal and the Private Residential Tenancies Board has been underway in my Department for some time and while it had been intended to introduce these amendments in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the need to progress other priority amendments in that Act meant that this was not possible.  The matter will now be progressed in the context of legislation to amend the Residential Tenancies Acts which I intend to introduce before the end of 2010.</P>

	<P>Under the Litter Pollution Acts local authorities have powers in relation to the defacement of structures by graffiti.  It is an offence to deface property visible from a public place.  A local authority may, on such terms and conditions as may be agreed by it with the occupier, enter and take remedial action to remove or otherwise remedy the defacement.  There is a complementary provision that enables a local authority in the interests of amenity or of the environment to take remedial action in relation to graffiti even if put in place with the consent of the owner/occupier.</P>
        <P>A local authority may serve a notice on the occupier requiring steps to be taken to remove or otherwise remedy the defacement within a specified period of not less than seven days.  Failure to comply with a notice is an offence and in the case of an offence the local authority may give effect to the notice and recover costs.  The local authority may also by arrangement with the occupier take steps to remedy the defacement.  The local authority or its agents may by agreement enter and remedy the defacement themselves.</P>
        <P>Penalties under the Litter Acts range from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;125 to a fine on summary conviction not exceeding &euro;3,000 and a fine not exceeding &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Litter Pollution Acts, the Criminal Damage Act, 1991 provides for the offences of damaging or defacing property.  The Garda&iacute; take the defacing of and damage to property very seriously and, when such offences are detected, perpetrators are processed through the courts or via the Juvenile Liaison System, as appropriate.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the response that I provided, on the issues raised, in my reply to Questions Nos. 371, 379 and 380 on Tuesday, 9 March 2010. </P>
        <P Just="Left">As I stated at that time, I met with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on Thursday, 4 March 2010, where the impact of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) levy on the broadcasting sector was discussed.  The Broadcasting Act 2009 requires the BAI to make an order imposing a levy on broadcasters for the purpose of meeting the Authority&rsquo;s expenses.  At that meeting, I acknowledged the very real concerns of the broadcasting sector regarding the proposed levy at a time of considerable financial constraints for commercial and public service broadcasters alike.  I also repeated my position on the need for the Authority to be vigilant in keeping costs down, particularly in the current economic climate.</P>
        <P>I advised the Joint Committee that I am currently examining a number of potential measures with a view to alleviating the burden that would be caused by the proposed imposition of a levy and I have committed to reverting to the Committee as soon as possible in this regard.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile the BAI is reviewing its initial budget proposal for 2010 with a view to reducing it and the Chief Executive Officer has given an undertaking to meet with the Joint Committee after this review.  While setting the budget is a matter for the Authority under the Broadcasting Act 2009, my Department will liaise closely with the BAI during the review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for the regulation of natural gas prices is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  The CER regulates the domestic and small business customer tariffs charged by Bord G&aacute;is Energy (BGE).</P>
        <P>In the current economic climate, I fully understand that customers are concerned about energy costs and the impact of commodity price trends on the prices that they face.</P>
        <P>Lower global gas prices, among other factors, led to the CER decision exceptionally in advance of the normal cycle to reduce tariffs for the gas sector by 12% from 1 May 2009.  This was followed by a further tariff reduction of 9.8%, which took effect on 1 October 2009.</P><Col N="272"/>

        <P>As part of an interim tariff review focussed largely on addressing subsequent downward movement in gas commodity prices, on 3 September 2009 the CER directed BGE to submit updated gas commodity cost and sales volumes (including actual and forecast data) during November.  Examination by the CER of that data, including actual figures to end October, allowed the CER to undertake a consultation process proposing an 8% tariff decrease with effect from 1 February 2010. On 6 January last, the CER directed BGE to decrease the tariff with effect from 1 February by an average of 8% for domestic and SME customers.   This meant that there has been 3 successive price decreases since 1 May 2009 amounting to a cumulative 27% reduction between 1 May 2009 and 1 February 2010.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the specific measures taken by the CER, following on a sustained downward trend in gas commodity prices, have been timely and positive for consumers.  I do not regard the claim that the most recent reduction was belated as justified in the light of the facts as outlined above.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the CER will continue to work with stakeholders to ensure that the benefits of sustained price downturns are reflected in cost-reflective tariff decisions in a timely and appropriate manner.</P>

	<P>In the face of ever-greater concentration of demand, the grouping of supply through producer organisations (POs) is an economic necessity in order to strengthen the position of producers in the market.  </P>
        <P>Accordingly, in its 2007 reform of the common organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables, the EU made further provision for financial assistance to producers grouping, on a voluntary basis, to form recognised POs under the EU Scheme of Aid for Producer Organisations in the Fruit and Vegetables Sector.</P>
        <P>These recognised POs implement approved multi-year operational programmes to improve the quality and efficiency of their operations. The programmes aim to improve the quality and commercial value of their produce by concentrating marketing, reducing production costs and stabilising prices and to promote the use of environmentally aware cultivation practices.</P>
        <P>The POs play a vital role in supporting Irish producers of fruit and vegetables. The strengthening of their role is a core part of the EU strategy for improving the competitiveness of the fruit and vegetable sector in the future.   My Department continues to encourage growers to become actively involved in Producer Organisations.</P>
        <P>My Department has secured nearly &euro;35m in EU Aid for Irish POs for the operational programmes they implemented between 1999 and 2008.   Claims in respect of programmes implemented in 2009 are being assessed at present.</P>

The applicant was advised by letter, dated 30 June 2009, that the remaining animals were not eligible for <Col N="275"/>payment as 13 had not been registered within the statutory 27 days of birth and the mother of the other remaining animal was moved from the herd before the animal was weaned. </P>
        <P>The applicant was given an opportunity to have this decision reviewed, which he did by letter dated 12 July 2009. However, the decision was upheld on review and he was notified by letter of 13 August 2009 that he could appeal this decision to the Agriculture Appeals Office within three months of the date of that letter. There are 26 animals born during 2009 for consideration under the 2009 Scheme. Paragraph 8.5.2 of the terms and Conditions of this Scheme states that:  Abrupt weaning of all animals at one time is not permitted. For herds with more than 10 suckler cows, a gradual weaning procedure must be followed when weaning.  Calves must be weaned in at least two separate groups with each group being removed at a minimum interval of 5 days.</P>
        <P>None of the animals are eligible for payment as two of the animals died while very young while the remaining 24 animals were all weaned on the same day &mdash; 26 October 2009, which is contrary to the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme.</P>

In all such instances, the landowner responsible took the appropriate measures to eliminate the weeds.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 680 and 695 together</P><Col N="276"/>
        <P>In an effort to support the equine industry I have approved three plants for slaughter of horses and I am aware that a fourth plant has been approved by the Local Authority Veterinary Service. This element of choice should improve competition and price paid to the producer.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to introduce a scheme to reduce breeding mare numbers, it is for the industry itself to respond to changes in the market place and to educate and increase awareness among owners on responsible breeding particularly in the current economic environment.</P>
        <P>In relation to equine welfare generally, owners have the primary responsibility for the welfare of their animals. Local authorities also have extensive powers under the Control of Horses Act, 1996. Officials of my Department have met with representatives of the local authorities to emphasise their responsibilities and the importance of their ongoing work in helping to reduce the number of potential horse welfare problems, particularly with regard to those horses being abandoned by their owners. My Department currently provides annual funding in the region of &euro;2 million to assist local authorities in their work in implementing the Control of Horses Act. I have also approved payments totalling &euro;1.185m to 112 organisations involved in the direct delivery of animal care and welfare services to assist with their work during 2010. A number of these organisations are directly involved in equine welfare.</P>

	<P>Out of 28,842 farmers due payments in REPS 4, 19,951 had been paid in full, including the 25% second instalment payment, as of 22 March 2010. </P>
        <P>To meet the requirements of EU regulations, applications for REPS payments have to go through an exhaustive series of administrative checks before payment can be released.  In a significant number of cases, those checks raised issues and queries which required further detailed examination.  Department staff are working to resolve these as quickly as possible.  Many of these cases will, however, require the applicants&rsquo; planners to amend the farm plans that were submitted originally.  The persons concerned have been made aware of the position and the applications will be further processed without delay on receipt of amended plans.</P>
        <P>In a small number of local offices, the processing of payments has been delayed by staffing issues arising from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions in the public service and the Department is attempting to resolve these difficulties.  My objective is to ensure that all outstanding claims are processed to payment stage as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>The closures of my Department&rsquo;s local offices in Sligo and Ballina are taking place as part of a major rationalisation plan for my Department that was approved by Government last year. This rationalisation process involves a comprehensive restructuring of the Department&rsquo;s local office network in order to provide a fully integrated service to our farming clients and the wider agri-food and rural environmental sectors at regional level. The plan involves reducing, from 57 to 16, the number of offices from which the Department will operate District Veterinary, Forestry and Agricultural Environment and Structures support services in the future. This will result in a reduction of some 400 in the number of staff working in my Department. This reorganisation will yield significant savings for the exchequer. </P>
        <P>The decision to close some forty offices of my Department was made only after a detailed study of the Department&rsquo;s operations at local level had been completed. Decisions were made in relation to the overall strategy and against a background of major changes in the Department&rsquo;s operating environment in recent years brought about by the impact of the Single Farm Payment, benefits derived from substantial investment in Information Communications Technology and significant reductions in the incidence of disease. These improvements in business <Col N="282"/>processes, information technology and communications will allow my Department to provide to all of our clients, the full range of services from the 16 enhanced offices set out in the plan.</P>
        <P>The closure of offices in Sligo and Ballina will result in the transfer of work to Drumshanbo, Co Leitrim and Castlebar, Co Mayo, respectively. All farmers in the county are notified prior to the closure of offices informing them of the changes and providing them with a Lo-call telephone number for their new regional office. The 16 enhanced regional offices will offer a comprehensive &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; service to all our clients encompassing the work of the District Veterinary Office, Integrated Controls and Agricultural Environment and Structures support services. In addition our farming clients will be able to access information relating to applications for Single Farm Payment from their regional office where previously they had to contact my Department&rsquo;s office in Portlaoise for such information.</P>

	<P>Out of 28,842 farmers due payments in REPS 4, 19,951 had been paid in full as of 22 March 2010.  Due to industrial action by staff in my Department, I am not in a position to provide a breakdown by county of the cases still outstanding.</P>
        <P>To meet the requirements of EU regulations, applications for REPS payments have to go through an exhaustive series of administrative checks before payment can be released.  In a <Col N="283"/>significant number of cases, those checks raised issues and queries which required further detailed examination.  Department staff are working to resolve these as quickly as possible.  Many of these cases will, however, require the applicants&rsquo; planners to amend the farm plans that were submitted originally.  The persons concerned have been made aware of the position and the applications will be further processed without delay on receipt of amended plans.</P>
        <P>In a small number of local offices, the processing of payments has been delayed by staffing issues arising from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions in the public service and the Department is attempting to resolve these difficulties.  My objective is to ensure that all outstanding claims are processed to payment stage as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>In the context of the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement in 2008, it was agreed that the relevant parties would enter into discussions regarding the terms and conditions, including remuneration, of both school secretaries and caretakers. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Following ratification of the Transitional Agreement by the Unions in November 2008, a forum was set up in December 2008 under whose auspices these discussions could be furthered. The forum is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Finance, and also comprises the relevant School Management Bodies, and the relevant Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU).</P>
        <P>As a first step, the forum decided to establish the factual position regarding the terms and conditions of employment of school secretaries and caretakers by conducting a comprehensive survey of schools. This survey was then developed by my Department, in consultation with the other members of the forum. As there are established terms and conditions for secretaries and caretakers employed in the Community &amp; Comprehensive sector and the VEC sector, it was decided that the survey should only cover the primary and voluntary post-primary sectors.</P>
        <P>This survey was then issued to all relevant schools on Monday, 20 April 2009. The results of the survey are currently being compiled by my Department and, once available, will inform the deliberations of the forum.</P>

	<P Just="Left">When the moratorium was introduced the Government exempted Principal and Deputy Principal appointments in all primary and post-primary schools and these  continue to be replaced in the normal manner. <Col N="284"/>The impact of the moratorium is  therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion.</P>
        
        <P>Unlike other areas of the public service retirement vacancies are actually  being filled and what the school loses is the capacity to make a promotion by  awarding the extra pay allowance to another teacher. The position whereby just  over 50% of all teachers have promotion allowances is simply not sustainable.</P>
        <P>I do recognise that the impact of the moratorium is uneven across schools and  as I have already acknowledged the impact is not just due to the level of retirements but also as a consequence of promotions that are made to principal  and deputy principal posts. Further retirements and promotions later this year will impact further on middle management posts. As I have indicated previously to the House I am prepared to look at this and see what limited interim alleviation can be given to deal with those cases while the overall number of promotion positions continues to reduce.</P>
        <P>My Department, like other Government Departments, is in discussions with the  Department of Finance in relation to a Public Sector Numbers Control Framework.  It is only in the context of such a framework for the education sector and  where an overall long term reduction in the number of promotion allowances is  brought about that the position of some individual schools could be addressed  for September next.</P>

        <P>PLC places are allocated to providers (mainly VECs) on an annual basis  following an application process. It is a matter for VECs to allocate places to  their colleges and institutions.

	<P>There are currently 31,688 approved Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) places nationwide.  This includes an additional 1,500 places approved in the context of the Supplementary Budget in April 2009. The 2010 budget for my Department has been framed on the basis that the approved number of PLC places for the next academic year will remain at 31,688. The overall <Col N="287"/>number of approved PLC places is set at its current level because there is a continuing requirement to plan and control public service numbers and to manage expenditure within the context of overall educational policy and provision. </P>

	<P>The person in question retains no entitlement to an occupational pension in respect of his service as a secondary school teacher. </P>
        <P>The person left teaching at the end of July 1976 before reaching pension age.  Subsequent to his leaving, preservation of pension benefits was introduced for teachers.  Under this provision a person leaving service on or after 30 June 1977 but before pension age, may preserve his/her benefits and qualify for pension on application when s/he reaches age 60, or, in the case of a new entrant to the public service after 1 April 2004, age 65.  On leaving, on or after 30 June 1977, a person had to have completed at least five years of pensionable service to avail of preservation. For persons leaving from 2 June 2002 that threshold has been reduced to two years pensionable service.</P>
        <P>Since the person in question had left service before 30 June 1977 he cannot benefit from preservation. If, subsequent to July 1976 the person in question took up pensionable employment in a public sector organisation he should provide the details to the Pensions Section of my department which will examine whether it might be possible to transfer his pensionable teaching service to that organisation.</P>

	<P>A significant number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act have already been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs. Specifically, the following sections have been commenced &mdash; 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 53. </P>
        <P>In the light of the current financial circumstances, it was not possible to proceed with full implementation of the Act in 2010 as had been originally envisaged. As the Deputy is aware, the commitment in the renewed Programme for Government is to develop, in consultation with stakeholders, a costed multi-annual plan to implement some priority aspects of the EPSEN Act, focussing on measurable, practical progress in education and health services for children with special needs.</P><Col N="289"/>
        <P>This process will require discussions with the education partners, as well as the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Department of Health and Children.  All parts of the EPSEN legislation, which have not been commenced to date, will be considered during this process. Until this costed, multi-annual plan is prepared and finalised, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for me to say when the remaining sections of EPSEN will be implemented. I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to the implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will continue to support schools, parents and children, and teachers and special needs supports will continue to be deployed to schools in line with my Department&rsquo;s policies.</P>

        <P>My Department examined this case in great detail in conjunction with Bus  &Eacute;ireann, which operates the School Transport Scheme, on behalf of my Department. Bus &Eacute;ireann advised that the number of children offering for transport from the area referred to by the Deputy, in the details supplied, has fallen below the minimum number required to maintain this service. As a result, and in accordance with the terms of the Primary School Transport Scheme, the service was withdrawn with effect from the commencement of the current school year. This position will of course be reviewed should a sufficient number of eligible children apply for transport at a future date.</P>
        <P>In the case of those children who are eligible for school transport and had been availing of the service up to now, parents have been advised that they may apply for a remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.</P>

	<P>The School Completion Programme (SCP) is my Department&rsquo;s programme for tackling early school leaving. The programme targets young people between the ages of 4 and 18 years and supports 468 primary and 223 post-primary schools in 124 School Completion Programme sites across 26 counties. </P>
        <P>Each School Completion project employs a local Coordinator to run the project at local level. Project coordinators come from a variety of backgrounds including youth, community and social work. Teacher qualifications are not regarded by my Department as essential or necessary prerequisites for appointment to the post of Project Coordinator. At present only 14 <Col N="290"/>of the 124 SCP coordinators are teachers, all of whom are seconded from permanent posts in schools. Not one of these coordinators have been replaced at this time.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to prioritise the secondment of teachers to positions within National Programmes where such positions will substantially require teacher qualifications. As the project coordinator positions do not fall within this category the secondments will not be renewed when they lapse in August 2010. No new secondments to the position of Coordinator will be entered into.</P>
        <P>From 1 September 2010, project coordinators who are seconded from schools may elect to return to their teaching duties or alternatively they may choose to continue their employment with the School Completion Project. Those coordinators who choose to remain in the employ of the School Completion Project will no longer benefit from a secondment arrangement with their school.</P>
        <P>School Completion Programme project staff are subject to the terms of the Moratorium on Recruitment and Promotion in the Public Service. My Department is currently in discussion with the Department of Finance to consider how future vacancies in the projects can be resolved in the context of the Employment Control Framework to be agreed for the Education Sector.</P>

	<P>The overall policy goal of my Department is to ensure the highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools. However, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population and competing pressure <Col N="293"/>on the capital budget available to my Department, it is necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools. During 2009, 222 schools have been approved funding for the purchase of prefabricated classrooms, with the option of building a permanent rooms. 68 of the approved schools have indicated to my Department that they intend purchasing prefabs and 94 intend to use the grant-aid to build a permanent room. The remaining schools have not yet indicated their preference. Due to industrial action on the part of some staff in the Department of Education and Science, I am not in a position to provide the detailed information sought by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement. Home tuition grants are paid to the parents, who in turn make payment to the home tuition provider. Payment of grant aid under the Home Tuition Scheme is made by my Department upon receipt of a completed claim form from the parent. If the claim is in order, payment normally issues within four weeks of receipt. Due to industrial action on the part of some staff in the Department of Education and Science, I am unable to provide specific details on the length of time it is currently taking to process grant payments to parents of children in receipt of home tuition.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that a number of amendments to the Student Support Bill in relation to legal and policy issues which have arisen since Second Stage are being advanced by my Department in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. In light of the commitment to put the grants on a statutory footing, I am anxious to provide a statutory basis for all student grants, pending transition to new administrative arrangements. This transitional period will necessitate retention of the existing administrative structures in the immediate term. In bringing amendments to Committee Stage, I will therefore be endeavouring to provide for existing administrative arrangements for this transitional phase, while progressing to a single scheme of grants as provided for in the Bill at the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Government&rsquo;s wider programme of public service reform, I am also re-assessing organisational options for the grants administration function in the longer run, with a view to revisiting the current proposals provided for in the Bill. Possible options for a more significant centralisation of functions are now being explored with a view to streamlining operations and maximising administrative efficiency. This examination is being undertaken as part of a business process re-engineering exercise being conducted under the Transforming Public Services agenda.</P>
        <P>These developments have required consideration of a complex set of legal options in relation to further amendment of the Bill and my Department has been working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to address the issues in that regard. I would like to assure the Deputy that these proposed amendments are now at an advanced stage of preparation and it will be my intention to proceed with the Bill on this basis in the shortest possible timeframe. Subject to the technical, drafting and legal considerations arising, my  Department hopes to be in a position to have these amendments advanced sufficiently in order to move to Committee Stage as early as possible in the current session.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 753 and 754 together.</P>
        <P>The supply teacher scheme was initially set up at primary level over 15 years ago at a time when schools had difficulty getting substitute teachers. The supply scheme operates on the basis of an additional full-time teacher being allocated to a school to cover certified sick leave absences in that school and a cluster of neighbouring schools. If the teacher is not required on a given  day to cover sick leave absences they generally assist with other work in their school such as administrative duties. There are 60 posts allocated to the scheme.</P>
        <P>A value for money review was published in July 2006 and is available on  my Department&rsquo;s website. The review found that approximately 60% of these teachers&rsquo; time was used to cover sick leave absences with the balance on various other school duties. This reflects the unpredictable nature of sick leave absences. While there are benefits for schools in having these full-time teachers it is considered more cost effective to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences instead of having a cohort of full-time teachers &lsquo;&lsquo;on call&rsquo;&rsquo; all the time in these schools to cover sick leave absences that may or may not arise.</P>
        <P>The supply teacher scheme will cease from the start of the 2010/11 school year. The teachers concerned will be redeployed in accordance with the existing redeployment arrangements to other schools that have vacancies. It is expected that this measure will save &euro;0.4m in 2010 and <Col N="298"/>&euro;1.1m in a full year. Due to industrial action on the part of some staff in the Department of  Education and Science, I am not in a position to give the full details sought by the Deputy.</P>

        <Quest> if he will introduce from September 2010, a new system of allocating teachers in schools who are over quota, such as where no redeployment has taken place, hours allocated to pupils with special needs as a means of reducing costs in the special needs area. </Quest>

	<P>The issue raised by the Deputy would primarily arise at post-primary level. The system that he is seeking to introduce is already in place. Under current arrangements post-primary schools that are over quota have their allocations for pupils with special educational needs dealt with through the offsetting of existing over quota posts rather than the allocation of additional posts. This policy reduces the cost of providing for special needs in these schools.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the policy in relation to the deployment of special needs teachers has not changed.  No decision has been taken to reduce the level of learning support/resource teachers in mainstream schools.  On the contrary, the level of learning support has increased at post-primary level.   Special classes continue to be supported providing the enrolments warrant the provision of such classes.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that special education continues to be a key Government policy. There has been unprecedented investment in providing supports for pupils with special needs in recent years. There are now about 20,000 adults in our schools working solely with pupils with special needs.  This includes over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs); 8,600 resource and  learning support teachers; over 1,100 special school teachers and hundreds of other teachers in special classes. Over &euro;1 billion is being spent in supporting special educational provision this year.</P>
        <P>As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and SNAs, much investment has taken place in the provision of transport, adapted school accommodation, assistive technology and specialist equipment. The National Council for Special Education will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and resources will continue to be allocated to  schools to meet children&rsquo;s needs in line with my Department&rsquo;s policy.</P>

	<P>Due to industrial action on the part of some staff in the Department of Education and Science, I am not in a position to give the full details sought by the Deputy.  However, applications from schools for additional accommodation are currently being assessed.  Schools will be notified of the outcome of their applications in due course.  In addition, all applications received under the Summer Works Scheme for 2010 are also being assessed.  Consistent with the timetable table published with the Scheme, it is my intention to announce a list of successful applicants later this month.</P>

	<P>My Department is very supportive of the SNA scheme. It has been a key factor in both ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes. The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Edu<Col N="304"/>cational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is at present carrying out a review of SNA allocations in all schools with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts are properly met. This exercise may result in the identification of surplus posts which are in the system and which do not meet the current criteria &mdash; posts that have been retained when a pupil&rsquo;s care needs have diminished or where the pupil has left. At the same time the NCSE is allocating additional posts where the criteria are met.</P>
        <P>There is no question of SNA posts being removed from schools where they continue to meet the scheme&rsquo;s criteria. However, there is also no question of posts being left in schools where they are deemed to be surplus to pupils&rsquo; care needs. At a time of constrained resources it is essential that we ensure that public resources, both staff and resources, are deployed as effectively as possible. Resources left in an area that are not in accordance with criteria mean public resources are not available for another deserving area.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the 2007/2012 Programme for Government commits to the long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable them to be supported as primary schools for children with autism.  I am pleased to advise that broad agreement has been reached on the core conditions to enable these centres to be recognised as special schools for children with autism and applications have been received for special school recognition from the centres in question. These schools, once recognised, will provide education for children with autism in line with my Department&rsquo;s policy. Detailed modalities relating to the transfer of staff are under consideration and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further in this regard. </P>

	<P>I have not met with the Northern Ireland Minister for Employment and Learning, in the period since 16 February, 2010 but I have received a letter from Minister Empey dated 16 March 2010 which refers to a meeting between the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Confederation of British Industry  (IBEC-CBI) Joint Business Council and Universities Ireland which took place on 16 February 2010.  I have not received any correspondence from either the IBEC-CBI Joint Business Council or Universities Ireland on the issue of student flows between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.</P>
        <P>A number of factors account for the differential in the flows of third level students between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  These include for example, a long tradition of students from the border counties here attending higher education courses in the north, a lower rate of acceptance by students in Northern Ireland of places in Irish universities compared to Leaving Cert students, a concentration in demand from students in Northern Ireland for a small number of programmes such as medicine for which there is a very high overall level of demand and intensive marketing by U.K. universities (including those in Northern Ireland) here while some Irish universities may focus promotional efforts more on non-EU countries.</P>
        <P>In relation to the evaluation of the Leaving Certificate Examinations and the A Level examinations for the purposes of entry to Irish universities, it should be noted that  universities are autonomous academically independent institutions within the meaning of the Universities Act 1997 and my Department does not have any functions in relation to their admissions policies and criteria.  However, I understand that the Irish Universities&rsquo; Association (IUA) in the Republic and the Council for the Curriculum Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) in Northern Ireland have recently corresponded about how the seven universities in the Republic will score the new A* grade at GCE A2 level. The IUA has confirmed that in 2010 the seven universities in the Republic of Ireland will be allocating 150 points to the A* grade, and 135 points to the A grade, and has conveyed its understanding to the CCEA that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) will also be allocating the same points to these grades.</P>
        <P>This information has been made publicly available by the universities to which most students from Northern Ireland apply through their websites, and has also been communicated directly by university admissions officers to students and guidance counsellors in Northern Ireland at various events.  These decisions have been taken by all seven universities in the light of a number of trends in the GCE system and within the overall framework of university admissions processes in the Republic of Ireland.</P>

	<P>My Department provides funds for over thirty projects in Local Drugs Task Force areas, including the project specifically referred to by the Deputy.  In the context of the budget for 2010 and the difficult fiscal climate, it was decided that funding for these projects was to be reduced from &euro;3,643,000 in 2009 to &euro;2,461,000 in 2010 and to cease from 2011.  While the overall reduction in the 2010 allocation is 32%, the percentage reduction for projects funded through County Dublin VEC varied, to allow for the retention of a minimum of one employee per project.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently reviewing the implications of the budget decisions relating to funding allocations for all of these projects. A key aspect of the review is to determine whether my Department is the appropriate location for these projects or whether funding could more appropriately be channelled through another Department or agency. The Department will submit recommendations for my consideration based on the review which, it is anticipated, will be completed shortly.</P>
