    <Title>Request to move Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32</Title>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice under Standing Order 32.  I call on Deputy Mattie McGrath.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter concerning self-employed persons when companies go into liquidation.  I refer to what happened to Pierse Construction in recent days where more than 1,600 sub-contractors were left penniless and their employees do not know what will happen.  Most of these people have families and there are sad stories behind them.  They are small business people who were left high and dry.  Major companies may have traded recklessly in the past.  It is happening more often now and something must be done by way of legislation in this House to deal with this problem that has had such an effect to date and will have such an impact in the forthcoming years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having consider the matter raised, it is not in order under Standing Order 32.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I ask the Ceann Comhairle, the Government Whip and all the party Whips why, once again, Independents are excluded on this big debate today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Whips are listening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We look forward to accommodating Members who wish to speak today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, you are missing the point.  It is always the Taoiseach who must get up or the Government who allocates time.  The Whips of all the parties should agree to a certain time for Independent TDs.  It is called D&aacute;il reform.  We have been talking about it for years.  Get real and get on with the job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has intimated that provision will be made for Deputy Finian McGrath.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is proposed to take No. 7<i>a</i>, motion re Technical Amendments to Standing Orders; No. 7<i>b</i>  &mdash; motion re Orders of Reference of Committees; and No. <i>b</i>16 &mdash; Statements <Col N="184"/>on the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 7<i>a</i> and 7<i>b</i> shall be decided without debate; and the following arrangements shall apply on No. <i>b</i>16: the statements of the Taoiseach and of the leaders of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Green Party and Sinn F&eacute;in, or a person nominated in his stead, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case, the statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case, the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case, and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two proposals to be put to the House today.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 7<i>a</i> and 7<i>b</i>, motions re Technical Amendments to Standing Orders and Orders of Reference of Committees, without debate, agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. <i>b</i>16, Statements on the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, agreed to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When is it proposed that this debate conclude?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody who wishes to speak on this debate should be allowed to speak, and it can continue next week if they wish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Government is so confident that this plan which it has been forced to bring in here is the path to recovery for the country, why does the Taoiseach not put down a motion and have it approved by the D&aacute;il by vote?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As was explained to the House, this policy proposal is being brought forward as a confidence building measure, internally and externally.  The first instalment of the plan will be on 7 December when the budget will be put to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept this.  This plan is not the path to recovery.  There are issues in it with which I agree, but it does not go far enough to rectify the state of the nation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be ample opportunity to discuss the merits of the plan when the debate starts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the Order of Business as proposed.  If the Government is stating that this is a first step or this is the path towards a first step, then let us adjudicate on what the Taoiseach considers is the path of recovery.  There are areas in it with which I do not agree.  There are areas on which the Government does not go far enough.  The Government&rsquo;s growth plan is non-existent.  It has nothing to do with the real problem out here of the spectre of the banking institutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will debate that matter in a few minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>From that point of view, if the Taoiseach is so confident about it, put it to the test and let us have a motion and a vote on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party does not agree to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s proposal to deal with this issue.  What is proposed here is a set of statements which is an anodyne way of dealing with a major document from the Government.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy Kenny, I, too, do not believe that this is a plan for national recovery.  It is a plan certainly for budgetary adjustments but it is not a plan for national recovery, and we will <Col N="185"/>discuss this in greater detail when we make statements.  There should be provision for questions to the relevant Ministers about aspects of the plan; no provision is made for this.  Many aspects of what is proposed in the plan are not clear.  There is a major question as to the status of the plan and to what extent it has been discussed, agreed or negotiated with the IMF and European institutions.  We have no opportunity in these arrangements to put those questions.</P>
        <P>In any event, it is a document that the Government should put to the House for decision.  We have no motion attached to the proposal and there is no opportunity to vote on the plan.  Earlier this week, I asked the Taoiseach whether he was confident he still retained a majority of Members in the House who would support this plan and the budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>All of these points can be made during the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;he intends to introduce.  At the time, he indicated he did have such a majority.  If he is confident of this, and he has used the word &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; on a number of occasions, then the proposal before us today should be subject to a motion and a vote in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies do not agree to the Order of Business proposed by the Taoiseach.  Yesterday, we watched the Minister for Finance arrogantly state that any proposals put before the people in the upcoming general election not based on the four year plan would be nonsense.  He also stated we all partied.  This is insulting to the Irish people; the Irish people did not all party and he should direct those remarks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is anticipating the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to where they actually apply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will make these points when the debate starts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, we saw the leader of the Green Party stand along with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Nervously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;lauding and applauding a four year plan despite the fact he has already given the Taoiseach a forward-dated notice to quit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not planning to debate it on the Order of Business.  Immediately the Order of Business is completed we will move on to the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What sort of governance are we witnessing here?  It is an absolute travesty.  Make no mistake about it, I happen to have to state I welcome the stated positions of Fine Gael and the Labour Party with regard to the Order Paper.  Sinn F&eacute;in presented these arguments yesterday and had to stand alone along with the Independent Deputies Finian McGrath and Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan.  I hope we will have a united opposition standing before the Taoiseach today because what he proposes is unacceptable.  We want a proper debate and we want the right as the elected representatives of the Irish people to pass judgment.  We can do so only by having a motion and a vote in the Chamber.  We reject what the Taoiseach proposes.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Will the Taoiseach clarify again the proposed date for the introduction of the Social Welfare Bill and does he expect it to be approved before the Christmas recess?  What is the proposed date for the introduction of the finance Bill which, as he knows, gives legal effect to measures in the budget?  The D&aacute;il will meet for nine more working days before the Christmas recess and according to the current calendar it is intended to break up for 33 days.  Given the international and national circumstances that apply, this is not appropriate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy knows, the social welfare Bill is taken in the immediate aftermath of the budget announcements, so it probably will be taken during that week.  The Finance Bill must be prepared and brought forward as quickly as possible.  On budget day, we probably will be in a better position to outline with a greater degree of certainty the timelines for the enactment of the budget announcements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That is if the usual circumstances apply and nothing happens to disrupt that situation.  In view of the observations from Europe, the longer things drift before the enactment of the Finance Bill, the more difficult it will be for taxpayers and Ireland because of the restrictions that will apply in respect of measures that may have to be drawn down from the contingency fund.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of these exceptional circumstances, does the Government propose to expedite the finance Bill?  Debate on the Finance Bill 2010 was not concluded until 3 April but we cannot allow our deliberations to take the same length of time.  It is just not on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will all be acting in the national interest in ensuring we enact the legislation that derives from the budget.  I cannot anticipate those decisions until the budget is announced.  There will be a better opportunity on budget day to give an indication of what is involved.  I certainly do not anticipate a timeline which is similar to last year&rsquo;s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the exceptional circumstances that apply, if the Government decides on budget day that it is in a clear position to make an indication on the finance Bill, surely this House should come back much earlier to deal with it.  We cannot expect a public that is distressed and under pressure to accept that the House will not meet for 33 days&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister stated that it would be inappropriate for him to comment further on the matter while it is before the court.  It is proposed in the four year plan to reduce the minimum wage by &euro;1 per hour.  Under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 a ministerial order is required to change the minimum wage.  When does the Government intend to lay that order before the House?</P>
        <P>Given that the House will not meet again until next Tuesday, is it intended that an announcement will be made between now and then in respect of restructuring the banks?</P>
        <P>I appreciate we will largely be dealing with economic issues today but tomorrow is the anniversary of the publication of the Murphy report into sexual abuse of children in the Dublin archdiocese.  Last year, the House unanimously agreed on a range of measures arising from that report.  I ask the Taoiseach if an opportunity could be provided next week to allow the Minister of State at the Office of the Minister for Children to report on progress, or lack thereof, on those matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the first matter raised by the Deputy, whatever statutory amendment is required to put that in place will be introduced.  I do not anticipate any change in advance of the budget announcements but it will be done thereafter by means of whatever legislative measure is necessary.</P>
        <P>In regard to the question on the discussions that are ongoing, I cannot anticipate when they will be concluded.  We are dealing with a number of issues which were discussed earlier this week on Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  The Cabinet will have to meet to discuss any developments when we come to that point.  I cannot anticipate the outcome but, clearly, whenever decisions are made it will be a matter of bringing them before the House during the course of that week to discuss them in full.</P>
        <P>The third matter raised by Deputy Gilmore was the anniversary of the Murphy report.  It is a matter for the Whips to determine if it is possible to provide for an update on the implementation of the recommendations outlined in that report.</P>

        <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm to the House whether the mayoral Bill will see the light of day in this House again or has it been scrapped as part of the fallout from this week&rsquo;s events involving the Green Party?</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise three matters.  To come back to the Multi-Unit Developments Bill, that has to come to the House for Report Stage.  It is particularly urgent legislation that has been hanging around for a long time.  Will the Taoiseach ensure Report Stage happens next week?  There should not be any difficulty in taking it up next week.</P>
        <P>The second matter has been raised many times in the House.  I note a recent comment from the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, that the deliberative process within Government on the children&rsquo;s referendum Bill was almost complete and that <Col N="194"/>there was some new form of wording to be published.  When will that occur and will it be this side of Christmas?</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the final matter, both Deputies Kenny and Gilmore raised the issue of the finance Bill.  I appreciate the Taoiseach said he will be telling the House on budget day when we will be taking the finance Bill.  Will he be more specific?  Does he not agree that the House should return at the very latest on 10 January and the finance Bill should be taken up by 10 January?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We have dealt with this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention to the fact his absent Green colleagues in government have indicated they want a general election to be completed by the end of January.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Will he tell the House whether the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has given the Taoiseach a stay of execution?  Would he not acknowledge it is in the national interest to bring stability to Government and to have the election the general public is demanding?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should resume his seat.  The Taoiseach should answer the queries on legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the first matter raised, it is hoped at this point that this legislation could come to the House next Thursday for Report Stage at least and hopefully for its finalisation.   On the second matter, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, has advanced a great deal of work in this area which we hope will come to Government soon, possibly before Christmas.  We may then have to come back and talk to people who have put forward other wording for discussion.  I do not know what the process may be but the work of the Minister of State is being advanced.  </P>
        <P>Budget day will be the day on which, based on the budget announcements, we can outline what legislative enactments are necessary to implement that budget and what period may be regarded as appropriate for its preparation and proper enactment.</P>

    <Title>National Recovery Plan 2011-2014: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call the Taoiseach to make his statement under Standing Order 43.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Today I begin a very important discussion and debate in this House regarding a four year plan which was published yesterday by the Government.  I said then and now reiterate that it is part of a three-pronged strategy for the immediate period ahead, which is important for this country&rsquo;s vital national interests.  It relates to the passing of a budget on 7 December and to the first instalment of the implementation of a programme that will not only bring order to our public finances, which is a prerequisite for growth, investment and confidence externally and domestically, but is also about a growth strategy as part of that process.</P>
        <P>It is true to say the challenge we face is something we have not had to look at for many years, possibly for as much as a quarter of a century.  The sort of correction we have to face is greatly exacerbated by an external international environment, not only in terms of economic prospects but fundamentally.  The financial architecture that underpins our economic system worldwide has gained greatly in importance since our world has become far more interconnected and interdependent than was the case even 25 years ago, with capital and trade flows of a far greater volume and a far greater degree of sophistication than was then the case.</P>
        <P>It is clear to all of us that this country has, by the provision of this plan, a signpost and a pathway to recovery which is within the recent experience of our people.  The fear and uncertainty, the real concern and worry were exacerbated in many respects by some elements of what I would regard as irresponsible commentary.  It  was feeding a frenzy of doubt and creating a spiral of increased worry and concern rather than resolving or analysing in a dispassionate way the very serious problems we face as a country.  The announcement yesterday of this plan gives people an opportunity to see what the level of adjustment will be in their own lives, to plan ahead for the future and to do so with a greater degree of confidence than in the absence of such a plan.</P>
        <P>There are a number of things to be said about this plan and about where our people now stand in regard to the nation&rsquo;s business.  Everybody knows from their own household budget experience that a country cannot continue in the same way in the aftermath of a serious crisis, the likes of which we have not seen, one of such magnitude and global impact that it has been compared to the Wall Street crash of 1929.  That was the occurrence back in autumn 2008 which is still reverberating around the world.  It is important to point out that from their own household experience people know that one cannot go on with a situation if one&rsquo;s revenues are back to what one earned in 2003 but one&rsquo;s spend is up to date in 2010 terms.  People know that is not a sustainable position and, therefore, they want to know how the country can change that situation in terms of national finances and bring about a state of balance.  They need to have, in some detail, an idea of how that might be done.  Whatever people want in terms of the plan&rsquo;s detail, however, they understand the framework.  They understand that the idea behind this plan is  that our taxation system needs reform and we need to see increased levels of taxation <Col N="200"/>coming into the national Exchequer to bring income for national purposes up to levels of the order of what we had in 2006.  We also know that the level of spend in our economy has to reduce to levels people saw around 2007.  That adjustment, or that closing of the accordion effect, in terms of people&rsquo;s understanding of what is happening, will enable people to see from their own recent experience that this does not mean they have to go back to a lifestyle or a living similar to, say, 25 years ago when, clearly, the quality of life and the standard of living we had at that time was very different from this generation&rsquo;s experience.</P>
        <P>What it means, what we can glean from that understanding, is that many of the important economic and social gains  we have seen under successive Governments in the previous ten or 15 years before this crisis can be maintained.  There are inherent gains.  Investments were made which are still with us.  Sometimes the portrayal of the very serious crisis we have to confront is understood to mean that everything went out with the sea, or that all that we did was a wasteful experience from which we obtained no community, social or economic gain.  That is a very misrepresentative view, a very fallacious and exaggerated view of the problems we have to face.  I do not diminish those problems for a moment.</P>
        <P>People need to know about the investments we have made in our education system, in improving our transport infrastructure and in our research and development community, the research we have done in industrial promotion and the far more diversified economy we now have.  The fact is that 1.86 million go to work in this country in the aftermath of a crisis, two and a half years on from something which hit us so hard over the following two years, almost, people felt, with an economic tsunami effect.  There was a reduction in output of 15% and we saw people&rsquo;s standard of living reduce.  It hit us in terms of a crisis in confidence, given the incremental improvements we had seen year on year in the previous period.  Many of those gains in infrastructural terms can be maintained.  Similarly, without going into an economic history lesson because we want to focus on the present and the future, the election campaign will give us an opportunity to go over some of those issues again in more detail.  However, it is also important to point out that during those good times, as a country, reflecting societal views and values, we ensured that those on the lower end of the scale benefitted.  We improved our pension provisions and made sure we brought in assistants to help our teachers and mainstream those with disabilities into our education system.  We are spending more than &euro;1 billion of our &euro;8 billion education budget to ensure that those people are integrated into our system and have potential and prospects to live inclusive lives.  That may not have been the case in a prior era of institutionalisation and lack of resources, with a far less enlightened culture.  There are so many things that have improved, qualitatively and quantitatively.</P>
<?oasys _cl14- ?>
<P>It is not in any way to engage in justification of the past.  Let that be dealt with, in all of its ups and downs and pluses and minuses, in the context of future democratic contests.</P>
        <P>It is important for our people to know that not all of those gains are going to seep away.  There is going to be a further adjustment, in addition to the adjustment in our standard of living we have seen in the past number of years, as we try to cope with the impact of this problem.  Throughout the good years when there were increases in our resources we maintained a level of spend as a percentage of our overall GNP &mdash; the overall worth and value of our economy &mdash; which was pretty static, at around 28%.  In other words, whatever investments we made and increased improvements we were able to give in whatever way we could were given to help working families.  This was done by increasing the rate of income which would attract income tax, from &euro;7,500, as it was at the beginning when things began to pick up, to more than &euro;18,000.  We did whatever we could do to improve age exemption limits for people who were <Col N="201"/>elderly and had pensions.  Whatever we could do in all of these areas, there was a greater degree of progressivity and help for those people.</P>
        <P>When we introduced the minimum wage, which has been increased on many occasions, there was a view that we would keep it out of the tax net.  That narrowed our tax base because we had more people in that area who had to be accommodated.  There are a number of people who have wages above that level but which are related to that figure.</P>
        <P>We now have an infrastructure to train people and favourable tax policies.  Credit must now be made available by fixing the banking problem.  This will include providing firepower beyond the capacity of our State behind which we can bring whatever extra capitalisation is needed to the banking system, and intensify as necessary the initiatives that we have brought forward thus far.  The purpose is to make our banking system work so that it is part of the integral process of growing and building confidence for the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The growth rate we have set out for this plan is about 2.75%, which is based on ensuring that we have a net increase in jobs of over 90,000 between 2012 and 2014, bringing unemployment down below 10% and making the adjustment of &euro;15 billion, to be comprised of two thirds on the spending side and one third on taxation.  We are proposing that balance because we believe it provides the best prospect of maintaining and growing employment.  Other parties take a different view.  We have set out what our proposals will mean for overall tax policy.  We will have to see a sharing of the burden and those who earn most will have to pay most.</P>
        <P>However, we cannot have a situation where more than 40% of working people are outside the tax net.  There will have to be a contribution which is proportionate to their income as part of this attempt to redesign a tax system which would be sustainable for future circumstances.  That can be done by respecting the principles of equity and progressivity while at the same time ensuring that everyone has to make  contribution to the system.</P>
        <P>If, for the sake of this debate, we take the Labour Party view, where half the reduction is through taxation and the other half through expenditure savings, what would that mean in terms of extra taxation?  We would have to raise &euro;7.5 billion rather than &euro;5 billion in taxes.  What would that come from?  We propose a 16.5% reduction in tax bands and credits which would bring in about &euro;1.8 billion.  If the Labour Party perspective was to prevail, then to get an extra &euro;1 billion as a contribution to the extra &euro;2.5 billion one would have to have another 10% reduction in tax bands and credits.  One would also have to double what we are doing on the site value tax, which would bring in another &euro;500 million.  One would probably have to double the carbon tax.  If one wanted to see if some capital tax could be introduced, one could look at asset values, etc., and try to get another &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million there.  One would also have to increase the VAT rate by another 2% to bring it up to 25%.</P>
        <P>If the idea is that we can do this by taking measures, half of which fall on the taxation side and half on expenditure then the design of the programme changes significantly and the imposition of further taxes and the impact it would have on a recovering economy in terms of a growth strategy would be detrimental.  We have opted for the strategy set out in the plan because we want to maintain jobs and have a growth strategy which has a prospect of working.</P>
        <P>It is very important that we try to look at the growth strategy we have.  In the real economy, even during this major correction in our economic fortunes, we are seeing an increase in exports and gains in competitiveness as a result of the policies we have already implemented.  In this plan we are setting out the further sectoral policies which are needed to help in that area.  The action to drive economic growth incudes the reaffirmation of the Government&rsquo;s unambiguous position of maintaining the 12.5% corporation tax rate, which is the cornerstone of our enterprise policy.  Action has been taken to reduce costs for businesses and professional services.  These will be ongoing and, together with the introduction of new and better focused <Col N="202"/>business investment which will target employment schemes, they will help small businesses by transforming the old BES scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We intend to maintain a high level of investment in research and development and innovation, double the number of industry-led research competence centres and target an increase in tourists to 8 million by 2015.  Some of the initiatives in that respect were outlined yesterday by the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  We will also liberalise visa restrictions for visitors from long-haul markets, make proposals to develop Ireland as a location for green data services, establish an international content services centre, which is at a progressed stage, and look towards our natural resources in agriculture, agritourism and agribusiness, which have shown great resilience.</P>
        <P>I remember at the height of the crisis in 2009 people suggested 40% of our agrifood business base would go because of a lack of competitiveness.  Yet, the decisions we took meant that practically all of those bases not only survived but have the prospect of thriving on the basis of the food harvest 2020 strategy, which is now being put in place.  They have added value to the agrifood sector and exports by over 40% during that period.  Developing Ireland as an international centre for food and making sure that we can drive forward the many advantages with the elimination of quotas and a grass-based production system is something that has been set out in great detail.  Tourism and agrifood businesses will be areas of growth based on indigenous enterprise that can be scaled up and internationalised, as we have seen.</P>
        <P>If we want to create more jobs we have to continue with the competitiveness agenda, the central object of which is to ensure that economic growth is translated into the maximum possible number of jobs, then the barriers to employment decisions have to be removed.  Many of the young and semi-skilled are not in the labour market and the challenge is to ensure they are able to participate in it.  In this regard the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance will include further details in addition to those announced in the four year plan.  We recognise it is not just a question of activation, it is also a question of people getting access to jobs in an environment that can create jobs.  We also recognise that we have to open up the labour market measures in order to maximise employment.  That is of fundamental importance and must be proceeded with.  We will also extend the PRSI employers&rsquo; exemption schemes which incentivise employers to create jobs for people on the live register into next year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of new and expanded work placement and upskilling programs will be introduced to help those on the live register back into employment, the details of which will be announced in the budget.  Major reform to activation measures will be implemented which will ensure that there is regular engagement with people on the live register and that they are offered pathways to work, training or education.  There is a need for control measures to make sure that people who are entitled to support are not denied that support as a consequence of activities in the black economy or because of those who use the State to earn an income in a way which is not in compliance with the rules or regulations that apply. It will require a very focused approach on all our parts.</P>
     
        
        <P>In regard to the reduction in expenditure, basically, we have three components in our expenditure programmes.  Public sector pay and pensions is approximately one third, social welfare is approximately one third and programme costs are approximately one third.  We have outlined how we will reduce it by &euro;7 billion on the current side over the next four years.  Some &euro;1.2 billion will come from payroll and pension costs, &euro;3 billion from programmes and &euro;2.7 billion from social welfare.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have already gone half way to reduce by 8% the number in the public service against the high of the end of 2008.  That will involve of the order of 25,000 whole time equivalents <Col N="203"/>leaving the public service.  We will see the number in our Civil Service going back to 2001 levels.  The number in the HSE will have to go back to 2005 levels.  There will be 13,000 garda&iacute;, which will be back to 2006-07 levels.  These are the sorts of changes that must take place in various parts of the public service.</P>
        <P>If we are to meet our commitments under the Croke Park agreement, which we have set out to do, it must be on the basis of full implementation of that agreement.  It will be critical in terms of redeployment and of looking at all the industrial relations issues which have arisen piecemeal for many years and which will now have to be dealt with in a comprehensive way.  We must get more from less.  We are not in a position to provide affordable public services on the basis of current structures.</P>
        <P>Budgets are being cut in agencies by more than 10% as they are being amalgamated, changed or reoriented completely.  We must see redeployment across the public service, not only within sectors but across sectors, whether the non-commercial semi-State bodies, the health service or education.  This will be a huge challenge for everyone in the public service.</P>
        <P>People recognise that if we proceed in the spirit and to the letter of the agreements we have reached, then there are prospects for us to make the changes.  These changes must be made, otherwise we will put at risk the very services on which the vulnerable and those who require them depend.  It is unacceptable in the situation in which we find ourselves not to be able to demonstrate the sort of flexibility and best practice approach across all levels of the service to ensure that with the money available from taxpayers, we minimise disruption of the services for those who require them and that we can improve services by taking on many of the technologies and practices which are evident in parts of the service but, unfortunately, not uniformly so across all aspects of the public service.</P>
        <P>It involves a huge challenge.  When one looks at this plan, the overall objective is to ensure that by 2014, we have a country in which unemployment is below 10%, in which public finances are back in order, which has been able to maintain investment, create jobs and provide prospects on a sustainable basis for all our people and which has a reformed public service provision that ensures efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of services and the organisational changes that are required, possible and now agreed between the stakeholders, whether management, unions or Government, for the delivery of those reformed services.</P>
        <P>The growth strategy is fundamental.  Any suggestion that there is an absence of stimulus in regard to this growth strategy does not make any sense for the following reason.  We have not only a deficit crisis but a debt crisis.  We are not in the markets borrowing money.  Currently, we are in the process of providing for a facility to provide stability for this country over the next three years and beyond and we must ensure we put in place and underpin the prospects of fixing and repairing the banking system not for the banking system itself, but because we cannot have a modern economic system without it.  We must ensure those who create wealth and jobs, those with an entrepreneurial spirit and those creating enterprises which are providing jobs for our people, are supported in every way.</P>
        <P>Despite the cutbacks in expenditure, we are maintaining and, indeed, increasing the level of investment in research, development and innovation.  Those societies that will succeed in the modern world in which we live, in the post crisis world we now inhabit, must be those which are prepared to innovate most and which are able to provide cost-efficient solutions to the problems people face and goods and services at affordable prices on international markets.</P>
        <P>We have seen an improvement in our export performance as a result of what we have done thus far and we must intensify that effort.  We have seen an increase in businesses and in investment coming into this country because we are still able to be marketed as a country which is well-educated, flexible and has the ability to the use the technologies the modern <Col N="204"/>multinational corporation networks now provide and which provide considerable and hugely important employment and, most importantly, bring in significant resources in tax revenues to our shores for the purposes of providing the services our people need.</P>
        <P>As we face into a new year and we hopefully complete the important national work of having published this plan and given people an indication of the size of the adjustment they will have to make going forward and having given them a realistic and ambitious understanding of what we can achieve, we must pull together as a country in the critical times.  We must recognise that we can look to the new year with a greater sense of clarity.  People want a greater degree of certainty.</P>
        <P>When people talk about renegotiation, changing plans and suggesting that all of this can be all worked out again, I make one point.  What has been set out here is a realistic appraisal of what is possible, necessary and doable.  If people say they want to make changes, ensure they add up and that they do not create more uncertainty at a time when this country critically needs some certainty.  I say that in a constructive way to the House because everyone has a perspective on these issues and a hope that we can pull through in these difficult circumstances.</P>
        <P>What is critical for this country is that this House rises to the challenge on 7 December and implements the budget so that our people can know that we will go forward in 2011 with the sort of support we need, the sort of facilities in place that are required and that we have a plan with which we can go forward.  After all of that in 2011, we can go to the people and ask them to decide who they believe should govern them on the basis of who has the most coherent policies and the best prospect of success.</P>
        <P>Other generations have come through other recessions.  I am not for one moment diminishing the significance of what we confront but it is surmountable and possible for us to come through.  In the new year, we can still live as one community, live with good neighbours, good family networks and people who are prepared to go out work for their country and their families and who are prepared to do more because they know there is less available.</P>
        <P>People want to see fairness and equity and to see everyone contribute.  That is fundamental to what Ireland is about.  We will see in our budget and from this Government&rsquo;s perspective every effort being made to demonstrate that also is part of the equation because it must be in the interest of social solidarity and community coherence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we objectively analyse this plan, we will realise it is the considered view of this Government that it provides the best balance between how we close the gap between what we spend and what we earn, between what needs to be changed in terms of public service provision and how we ensure our programmes are still in place and between how we maintain jobs and an investment strategy and ensure we have a taxation policy and system which will raise sufficient revenues to meet the corrections and the adjustments that must be put in place.</P>
        <P>All that said, we believe this plan offers the best prospects upon which to build the four annual budgets needed to get us through this crisis with growth, jobs and support for those in the productive private sector.  Ultimately, we must look to such people for net job creation as we reform our public services, not because we devalue or diminish their importance and that of those working in such services, but because we need an affordable model in future with the necessary reforms outlined.  That will secure the future for ourselves and our children.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach is speaking about an election at some time in 2011.  God forbid that would happen.  I wish we were now in the throes of an election that would bring the certainty and clarity spoken of by the Taoiseach.  I met an engineer the other day who is 23 years old and fully qualified.  He told me he had a permanent visa for Australia and was going to travel to and stay there as he would get a reasonably well paid job and be able to settle down.  When I asked him if he would ever return to Ireland, he said he would not because every cent of income tax he would pay in this country for the rest of his life would go towards repairing the consequences of bankers&rsquo; recklessness and greed, which were allowed to happen under the Taoiseach&rsquo;s watch.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This Minister presided over the greatest economic catastrophe in this nation&rsquo;s history and along with the Taoiseach, he has invited people from abroad and the IMF to this country because the Government has led us to a position where we have never been before.  The founders of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party never envisaged that our economic sovereignty would be cast away.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance came into the Chamber to tell us this would be the cheapest bank bailout in history.  He said the Irish taxpayer would make a profit from the recapitalisation of the banks.  Did I hear him correctly?  He stated that Anglo Irish Bank could not be wound down because it was of systemic importance to the Irish economy.  He told us the negotiations with the subordinated bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank would destroy Ireland&rsquo;s reputation.  This is the same Minister for Finance who a week ago said we did not need any outside help.  Afterwards, the Taoiseach announced that those people were invited to this country.</P>
        <P>I will not take any lectures from a Government that, to put it mildly, was not fully in compliance with the truth when speaking to this Parliament and the Irish people.  The Taoiseach and his Government have failed to live up to the charge, trust and responsibility given to them by the Irish people.  They are now involved in negotiations in what amounts to a contract or agreement and the Irish people, from what I hear, will never be able to rise to meet the level of repayment involved if forced down this route.  That agreement has the Government as the principal partners on what is essentially a board of directors.  Under Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution, that agreement should be approved by this House.  If we are talking about interest rates above 5%, the process will place this country, our taxpayers and the younger generation in a catastrophe.</P>
        <P>I recognise there are many great elements to our country and it has enormous potential.  The Government has led our country and people to the edge of this economic abyss.  Nobody else had a part and it was on the Government&rsquo;s watch that all this happened.  I listened to the Minister for Finance yesterday talking about the party having posters in the last election about <Col N="207"/>more garda&iacute;, nurses and teachers, making the extraordinary claim that my party put forward a proposition to get rid of 30,000 garda&iacute;, teachers and nurses.  How arrogant can one be?  I remember posters from his party indicating that health cuts hurt the old, sick and lonely.</P>
        <P>We have been led to a point where negotiations are to be concluded at the end of this month and early in December that may, from what I hear, place an excessive and extraordinary burden on the Irish taxpayer and generations to come.  This document will not constrain or confine the next Government; it is a Fianna F&aacute;il document.  Departments and local authorities are littered with documents like this one which have never been acted upon.</P>
        <P>This is the hallmark of what Fianna F&aacute;il has always said in respect of reforming institutions and service delivery.  This is a plan which the Taoiseach has argued will bring clarity and certainty to what is happening.  He has said in respect of reforming institutions and service delivery that greater productivity must be achieved, along with greater accountability.  He has argued that the performance of organisations and individuals must be better.  The Minister for Social Protection has said nurses will not be sweeping the streets.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>He asked for prayers in Donegal, and they may well be necessary.  This document does not provide certainty and clarity required to get this nation back where it should be.  It does not address the real potential or open itself up to receiving the contributions that Irish people are prepared to make, provided they are recognised and respected as being fair.  The Government made a big point about reducing the minimum wage but it has not acted on the other end of the scale, where exceptional salaries still apply.  Nothing has been done about starting the process in this place about the cost of governance and the way we do business, and the Government is refusing to do so even today.  It has indicated that we will come back some time at the end of January to debate the Finance Bill, whenever and if it is produced.</P>
        <P>Everything for this Government is akin to groundhog day.</P>
      
        <P>People have had enough.  As I have stated previously, the Government should have gone by now.  If the traditional definition of madness is to do the same things over and over, then this Government&rsquo;s economic and banking policy fits into that category.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Thousands of people woke up this morning and looked at the state of their lives and their circumstances, as the Taoiseach noted.  They wonder if they will be able to manage or pay for the charges that are coming, the food on the table and the medicines they need to stay well.  Older people will look out at frost-bitten ground this morning and wonder whether next year will be like the past year except worse and where they will find the resources needed to heat their homes.  Meanwhile, in the air-conditioned skyscrapers of Frankfurt and elsewhere they will be licking their lips at the millions to be made by betting against this country.  Our country was not brought to this point only by the incompetence of the Government.</P>
        <P>Even as the Government was outlining its plan yesterday, interest rates on Irish bonds were rising again.  It is not sufficient to say it takes a while for confidence to be restored &mdash; it does &mdash; because there is no belief in the Government and it has no credibility left.  That is the principal reason people do not want to invest here.</P>
        <P>What was needed was a plan that was open and honest.  The plan before us does not fit those criteria.  What we got was a document which pretends to deal with the real crisis facing the country.  The Government was supposed to set out the details of a four year strategy.  While there is a front-loading in respect of year 1 of the strategy, where are the details the Government was supposed to provide for the subsequent years?  Where is the evidence of the real and <Col N="208"/>radical political reform people are crying out for and which would demonstrate some sense of leadership and understanding of what are Ministers&rsquo; responsibilities?  The Green Party has left Government but is still on the benches opposite.  Whether it was a rush of blood to the head that caused it to make its decision, I do not know but its Ministers are still members of a Cabinet in which they have no confidence and where treachery and betrayal are on the table.  This is not the way to run a country, particularly in these circumstances.</P>
        <P>If the savings provided for in the plan are to be used for the continuation of what has been a catastrophic failure of banking policy and if this forms the entire basis of Ireland&rsquo;s economic deal with the European Union and International Monetary Fund, this country is clearly on a road to a decade of economic stagnation and potential insolvency.  I do not yet know what is the nature of the negotiations in which the Government and IMF are involved but I would like to find out what is the IMF&rsquo;s analysis of the growth projections for Ireland if it believes taxpayers can pay back at what appear to be excessive and exorbitant interest rates.  I intend to ask the IMF about this.</P>
        <P>This document does not deal with the root cause of the problem, namely, the failure of the Taoiseach and his Government to get an effective public sector which delivers value for money and services for people.  Page 65 of the plan states this will have to be the case.  This is not the type of plan which will enliven things in such a way as to allow us to say we are on the road to recovery.</P>
        <P>The failure to reflect the additional costs of the Government&rsquo;s failed banking policy makes a joke of the public finance projections underpinning the plan.  Their absence makes the debt forecast nonsensical.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The projections will be out of date next week, even before the budget is delivered.  The reckless bailouts have been at the core of the Government&rsquo;s failure to restore domestic and international confidence.  The mantra by the Minister for Finance that bailing out reckless banks and their investors was necessary to protect Ireland&rsquo;s credit rating has proven to be a catastrophic misjudgment.</P>
        <P>In previous times, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor wrote blank cheques to his predecessor.  The Government has gone one better in that blank cheques have been written from the taxpayer to Anglo Irish Bank and other reckless lenders to bail out their investors.  This blank cheque policy has destroyed Ireland&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  If it were not for the historical and potential future losses for Irish taxpayers arising from the Government&rsquo;s banking policy, our public finance problems would be judged by the financial markets to be difficult but manageable.</P>
        <P>I believe in this country but I will not be bound by the Government&rsquo;s four year plan.  As I stated yesterday, while I accept the targets as being clear, the proposals and a number of issues in the plan will be renegotiated.</P>
        <P>During the past two years, the Government had a clear choice between protecting the State and its people or bailing out reckless investors and even more reckless bankers.  It chose the latter option every time and forced the taxpayer to take responsibility for the massive debts built up by Anglo Irish Bank and others.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I met a senior team from one of the world&rsquo;s largest investment companies last week.  It described the National Asset Management Agency as a bureaucratic monster that was destroying value and confidence in Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  NAMA has paralysed the property market.  If one speaks to any auctioneer or anyone involved in property, one will find that nothing is moving because everything is blocked up in NAMA.</P><Col N="209"/>
        <P>The scams that are taking place have become evident.  Some developers seek to make a killing on funding from within NAMA to complete particular projects.  They deliberately ask potential subcontractors to overprice works in order that a pay-off can be made.  This issue needs to be addressed because NAMA has paralysed and caused gridlock in the property market.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael Party was the first party to argue that it was completely unfair for Irish people to shoulder all the losses arising from the banking crisis, whether through nationalisation or the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.  It was only fair that people who had lent recklessly to the banks should share the pain.  It is a basic rule of capitalism that if one lends recklessly to failed institutions, one must take some of the consequences.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has confirmed that the next Government need not be bound by the four year plan of what is now a tired, unimaginative and demotivated Government.  As I stated, I accept the deficit target of 3% of GDP by 2014.  What is needed to achieve this target is a Government with a strong, clear mandate from the people.  Once people have given their verdict, a new Government can implement its plans by placing a strong emphasis on a number of areas.  It would first cap taxpayers&rsquo; exposure to further banking losses.  Second, it would introduce real economic reforms to spur growth and jobs and, third, it would create a smaller, better, and more effective State, as set out in Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s document, Reinventing Government.</P>
        <P>The bedrock of any credible economic plan agreed with Europe must be a new banking policy which limits the State&rsquo;s exposure to further losses from the banks.  We all agree that we need to repair, restructure and adequately capitalise Irish banks to underpin our guarantee on savings and get credit to business flowing again.  The Taoiseach should talk to the owners of small businesses.  Despite what has been said, many of the conditions laid down by banks preclude businesses from securing credit.  The other day, I was contacted by a man whose company has an annual turnover of &euro;1.5 million.  He had his &euro;40,000 overdraft facility reduced to &euro;5,000 and told me one could not run a sweet shop on such an overdraft.</P>
        <P>While I agree with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s sentiment that it is necessary to free this up, he is not in a position to make it happen.  Although economic reforms are really needed to spur growth and jobs, the plan does not spell this out in any detail.  This is nothing like what can be achieved or like the potential that exists.  In that respect, this document is both a disappointment and a failure.  The Government has done nothing to overhaul the regulatory and economic bureaucratic red tape.  When one sees the evidence of what is strangling those who wish to contribute to the well-being and future of the country, it is evident where the Government has been strangled by its inability to deal with this issue.</P>
        <P>If we are to have a nation that will measure up by 2016 and beyond, we really must change the way in which we do business.  This document makes no reference to leadership by example from the seat in which the Taoiseach is sitting.  Throughout the Government and local authorities and right down the line, there is no evidence but only aspirations as to what can be achieved.  In this sense, this document has been a gross disappointment because people expect leadership from the front.  They want to see it at the centre and to be shown the way from the top down.  One should appeal to Irish people, particularly that young generation whose representatives are leaving the Gallery at present, as they are the future of our country.  However, the national recovery plan will not realise the potential that exists.  Whenever the population decides to elect whatever Government it wishes, if I have anything to do with it issues in this plan will be renegotiated and the next Government will not be bound by them.</P>

	<P>This plan is the added price the people of Ireland must pay for 13 years of Fianna F&aacute;il misrule.  It is a price that must be added to the price already paid by those <Col N="210"/>who have lost their jobs, whose businesses have gone or whose pay and services have been cut.  This price must be paid by pensioners and people on the lowest pay, as well as by families and households nationwide.  In his speech in this House today, the Taoiseach invites us to forget about the past&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; and to all round the new year together.  Consider this plan as some kind of down payment or deposit on another four or five years of Fianna F&aacute;il rule.  That is what this plan is about.  This plan is the direct result of the politics of the Galway tent and of &ldquo;show-time&rdquo;.  It is the result of the unbelievable political arrogance and folly of the worst Governments in the history of this State.  There was another example of this arrogance yesterday from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who stated that anything that is put on the table that is not contained in this plan is nonsense.  This is the same Minister who told us that the bank guarantee was the cheapest in the world.  This is the same Government that told us that it would not cost the taxpayer anything.  It is the same Government that told us, when the Labour Party suggested the taking into temporary public ownership of the main banks rather than the NAMA strategy, that this was nonsense too.  Now the banks must be taken into public ownership anyway at enormous additional cost and still are mired in NAMA.  While this is the work of the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, it also is the legacy of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is the direct result of the bank guarantee that joined the future of the State to failed banks.  This plan proposes &euro;15 billion in budget adjustments, starting with &euro;6 billion in 2011.  It is a recipe for hardship and stagnation, for delayed ambitions, unfulfilled potential and broken dreams.  Yet, for all that, the sad reality is that a programme of adjustment now is unavoidable.  However, one should note from the outset that the status of this plan remains unknown.  Is it a document that has been agreed with the European Union and the IMF and which will form part of the loan agreement between Ireland and the international community?  Is it to be part of the memorandum of understanding for that loan?  Alternatively, is it a negotiating document that is subject to change and revision before the final deal is concluded?  Is it simply the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto for a general election that now is both inevitable and imminent but which that party will wish to delay for as long as possible into the new year?  Ministers have been claiming for weeks that the plan has the blessing of the IMF and the European Union.  However, a spokesperson for the Department of Finance yesterday stated otherwise, indicating that the plan can be changed in negotiations.  The question is how much has been approved and agreed and how much might be changed.  Members do not know the answers to these questions, just as they do not know so much else about the negotiations that are going on behind closed doors.</P>
        <P>For example, they do not know who is negotiating on behalf of Ireland.  The public now is more familiar with the principals from the IMF and European Union teams than they are with the Irish negotiators.  It is known that Mr. Chopra is negotiating for the IMF and that Commissioner Rehn is in overall charge of the negotiations for the European Union but who exactly is negotiating for Ireland and exactly what are they negotiating?  The size of the loan is unknown nor is it known how much of it will go straight into the banks.  Moreover, the rate of interest that will be charged is unknown, which is a critical issue.  Professor Karl Whelan of UCD has raised this issue and has shown calculations that suggest an interest rate of 6% or perhaps 7%.  This would have enormous consequences for Ireland and the Government must reveal both what it is negotiating as a credit facility and that this is what is being negotiated, rather than some kind of sub-prime loan.  There is no justification and no rationale for charging <Col N="211"/>Ireland more than Greece and the Government should insist on a better deal.  This is Ireland&rsquo;s problem but it also is a euro problem and responsibility works both ways.  When the deal is concluded, will the four year plan bind the next Government, a Government of which this Fianna F&aacute;il Cabinet is unlikely to form any part?</P>
        <P>As I have said on many occasions, the Labour Party supports the target of cutting the deficit to 3% by 2014.  It does so not because we believe it will be easy to achieve but because it is necessary for Ireland to stabilise its public finances.  However, we do not support the notion that the adjustment should be front-loaded with a figure of &euro;6 billion in 2011.  This level of front-loading poses a grave risk to jobs and growth and is a risk that should not be taken.  Moreover, the Labour Party is supported in this position by the leading article in today&rsquo;s edition of the<i> Financial Times</i>, which I will quote to the Taoiseach.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Cuts of this magnitude could throw Ireland back into recession.  That would be a tragedy: yawning as it is, Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal gap is the least of its challenges; a slower pace of consolidation might have been its best bet at encouraging growth.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Taoiseach challenges the Labour Party about its statement to the effect that a &euro;6 billion adjustment should not be undertaken in the first year but that such an adjustment should be more modest and should be balanced on a broadly 50:50 basis.  The Taoiseach plucked figures from the air and suggested such an approach would mean this much more on this tax and that much more on the other tax.  This misses the entire point, which is that we must allow the economy to grow and get people back to work.  If this is done, tax revenues will increase because more people will be at work and the economy will be more successful.  However, the more that is cut from it, the more likely one is to drive the economy further into recession.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember where that figure of &euro;6 billion came from, because it has become a kind of Holy Grail.  It emerged in the last weeks before Ireland sought external assistance at a time when the idea was that one had to impress the markets.  The argument was being made by the Government that the markets would be impressed were Ireland to get its deficit down below 10%.  The claim was made that bond dealers, who work for international banks, would be fooled into believing that &euro;9.99 is not a tenner.</P>
        <P>Now that strategy has failed.  In fact, the &euro;6 billion figure impressed nobody, because it was clear that an adjustment on that scale would pose a grave risk to growth.  Now, however, the Government does not believe it can row back on that figure, even though we are no longer in the market.  How clever does the &euro;6 billion look now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the basis on which the talks are taking place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This plan is called a plan for national recovery.  In fact, it is a plan for austerity, not for recovery.  There is no coherent jobs strategy in the plan.  There is plenty of waffle about the so-called smart economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not waffle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the same stuff we have been hearing about for almost two years.</P>
        <P>The section on jobs is short on detail, particularly compared to the detail on cuts and tax increases.  Where, for example, are the concrete numbers on training and employment programmes?   The only numbers referred to are the small numbers already provided for.  Where is there an investment strategy that uses what limited resources we do have?  There are references to investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Given the track record of the Government, it is clear that this is not serious and is not intended to happen.  Instead, it is argued that <Col N="212"/>the pensions reserve fund will buy Government bonds.  That is code for saying we are about to liquidate what we can.</P>
        <P>The proposals in the document are not fair and they are not balanced.  Even after all the damage the Government has done, this plan provides a hard landing for PAYE workers and a soft landing for the friends of Fianna F&aacute;il.  There is no indication that those who have the most will contribute the most.  There is no higher tax rate for the highest earners, no cap on high-level pensions and no cap on the highest level of public sector pay.  Higher capital taxes are postponed until 2012, while PAYE taxpayers are hit immediately.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a cut in the minimum wage, for which no compelling logic is presented and for which there is little real demand.  I can see an argument for a review of the way the joint labour committee system works and for looking, for example, at the issue of premium payments for Sunday working.  However, what is the point in cutting a minimum wage that affects fewer than 50,000 people?  This is being done for purely ideological reasons.  If the same logic is applied to sectoral wage agreements, then what we will get is a low-wage economy; but then, we have always known that the PDs in Fianna F&aacute;il are in favour of a low-wage economy.</P>
        <P>In his article in the <i>Financial Times</i>, the Minister for Finance quotes Abraham Lincoln, but there is nothing of the &ldquo;better angels of our nature&rdquo; about this plan.  While those on the minimum wage are being hit now, the high-flying tax exiles are exempt once more.  In a reply to Deputy Shortall, the Minister for Finance admitted that the contributions sought from tax exiles in last year&rsquo;s budget will not yield a single cent before October 2011.  After this budget, ordinary taxpayers and social welfare will have been hit twice but the tax exiles will continue to fly in and out of the country without the inconvenience of having to pay tax.</P>
        <P>A number of proposals in the document, however, are in line with ideas the Labour Party has advanced.  For years, Fianna F&aacute;il have been denying that there is anything to be gained from cuts in tax expenditures.  At last, the plan accepts that some &euro;1.5 billion can be achieved from curtailing tax breaks and limiting relief for pension contributions, although again, we see no real commitment.  If the Government was serious, there would be a proper minimum effect tax rate to ensure that everyone pays their fair share.  There would also be a clear commitment to fairness in dealing with the pension relief issue, which has more to do with how much in total can be claimed in tax relief than the rate at which the relief is given.</P>
        <P>It is also, unfortunately, necessary to curtail the capital programme, although it is disappointing that there is no alternative strategy set out to replace this spending from other sources, such as through a strategic investment bank, as has been proposed by the Labour Party.  There are a number of innovative ideas for how this can be done, but the plan does not embrace any of them.</P>
        <P>A further shift to environmental charges through the carbon levy is sensible, although the Government should now meet its commitment on fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>There are also aspects of the plan that, once again, disappoint.  For all the hype about the preparation of this document, and all the stories we have been told about the lengthy Cabinet meetings that went into preparing it, it contains the same old approach to public expenditure.  What we are getting is butchery, not surgery.  Once again, the Book of Estimates has been subjected to a crude hacking exercise rather than a truly comprehensive expenditure review.</P>
        <P>What we need to see, and what should have happened two years ago, is a proper root and branch review of expenditure, along the lines of the Canadian model.  Instead of sending in an external consultant to prepare a report, a proper expenditure review would be led by Ministers and Secretaries General.  Instead of asking the question, &ldquo;What can we cut?&rdquo;, you start with the question, &ldquo;What are we trying to achieve?&rdquo;. You sit down and ask searching questions <Col N="213"/>about what it is that Government is doing in providing the service, and how it is being provided.  That is not an exercise that can be conducted from Opposition.  It is an exercise that must be conducted by Government, where we look at a problem from first principles and redesign public expenditure accordingly.  There is a reference in the document to such an exercise.  It is called Government expenditure assessment, but it is no more than an aspiration.</P>
        <P>Some spending cuts are particularly disappointing.  The plan seeks &euro;300 million in cuts from education but is unclear about how that will be achieved.  It has been reported that this will mean a loss of 1,200 teaching posts, including language teachers for newcomer pupils and teachers for Traveller children.  This is a fundamental U-turn on the so-called Green Party victory of 150 extra teachers promised in the revised programme for Government.  They are now &ldquo;deferred&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is hard to see any logic in the proposed &euro;200 charge for students in further education.  Many of these students are from families with modest incomes, for whom this charge could be a real disincentive.  What is the point in imposing a &euro;200 annual registration charge when the alternative might be paying &euro;200 per week to the same person on the dole?  It is just one of the many mean-spirited elements of this plan.  The concept of universal access to third level education is further eroded, with another hike in the, so-called, registration charge and a non-specific cut in student support.</P>
        <P>The plan also sets targets for reductions in the social protection bill, but offers little in the way of specifics.  The clear implication is that there will be significant cuts in rates and that these, too, will be front-loaded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The most striking feature of all of this is that the Government has no mandate for this plan.  It is negotiating a deal behind closed doors that will bind the next Government in a fiscal and economic straitjacket for the duration of the IMF-EU programme.  A number of commentators have suggested that there may be room for manoeuvre in how the programme is implemented and that the IMF and EU will focus only on headline targets and allow the next Government to negotiate on how those targets are achieved, but there is no certainty about that.  We do not know anything concrete about the deal that is being done on the banks.  We do not know what the cost of that deal will be or whether there will be burden sharing with the bondholders.  We do not even know what kind of banking sector Ireland will have next year.</P>
        <P>I quote Professor Philip Lane in this morning&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times:</i></P>
        <P LI="1">The plan is silent on the impact of the banking crisis on projected growth rates.  While much will turn on the resolution plans that are set to be announced in the coming days, some discussion of this key issue would have been welcome.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This is a critical point.  The plan is based on the idea that there is strong underlying growth potential in the Irish economy, largely as a result of Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to export.  I agree with that viewpoint.  Ireland does have many strengths, and we do have a capacity to recover from this crisis.  However, there is a lot about the way the Irish economy will perform that we do not know.  We do not know how consumers will behave in the months and years ahead, if the rapid increase in the savings ratio will unwind and how quickly consumers will regain confidence.  Nor do we know what impact the impaired banking system will have on the performance of the domestic economy.  That uncertainty further underlines the need for caution in the way the budget adjustment is implemented.  There is a capacity for more consumer spending and more investment activity once growth resumes and confidence is restored.  However, these are highly uncertain, while the impact of withdrawing &euro;6 billion from the economy is pretty clear-cut.</P><Col N="214"/>
        <P>Unfortunately, we do not seem to have a Government that is capable of making that case on behalf of the Irish people.  Of all the many gaps in this plan, perhaps the most striking is the lack of vision.  In many ways, this plan is the instrument of surrender, offered up by a Government that is a beaten docket.  It offers no bridge to the future and no sense of what we can achieve, as a people, if we come together to work our way out of this mess.  It offers no bridge to the future.  It offers no sense of what we can achieve, as a people, if we come together to work our way out of this mess.</P>
        <P>We are not the first country to find ourselves in this kind of economic crisis.  Even if the scale of the Irish disaster is particularly bad, we can still learn from others who have been through similar experiences.  The lesson we can learn is that we must keep and protect our bridge to the future.  We must know what it is that will underpin our prosperity and our sense of national unity in the days ahead.  We must protect and defend it, and invest in it.</P>
        <P>Much has been said in recent days about the 12.5% rate of corporation tax and the importance of keeping it.  I agree with these comments.  The Labour Party was instrumental in introducing that rate.  However, there is more to Irish sovereignty and more to our future than the corporation tax rate.</P>
        <P>We must understand that social solidarity is not an economic cost, but a vital economic foundation.  What we needed to see in this plan was not just a sense of an economy, but of a society that offers our children a decent future.  We need a realistic strategy on jobs, not just repetition of the same old stuff.  We need a strategy with a strong commitment to building on Ireland&rsquo;s competitive strengths and investing in our future, supplying credit to firms, and getting people off the live register and into meaningful training and work experience.  We did not get that because Fianna F&aacute;il is incapable of it.  We are living in the ruins of its discredited philosophy and policies.</P>
        <P>The four year plan is the price of political failure.  It is a heavy price indeed.  The Taoiseach invites us to consider what kind of country we will have in 2014.  I agree with all the objectives he set out for us today as to the kind of country we desire in 2014, a country with people back at work, with businesses working again, with confidence restored in our domestic economy and in our country among those abroad, with good quality public services, and with a reformed public service and a reformed body politic.  We will only achieve this when the political change the country is crying out for comes about.  I hope that will happen sooner rather than later.</P>

Although I disagree with its assessment of what we can and need to do within the four year period, and with some of the protest approaches, I acknowledge there is room for different opinions in this regard, and for the views of Independents.</P><Col N="215"/>
        <P>In this most fearful and difficult time for our country, it is important that we begin by establishing ground rules of respect for one another.  People are looking for these and want us to offer them reassurance and security, which they and we all do not have at present.  We all know in our hearts that this is a very challenging and difficult time.  We need to address that.  We have a duty of care to the people to try to minimise the sense of fear and manage a very difficult set of circumstances.</P>
        <P>We need to protect the people in a number of ways.  We need responsible debate in the House.  The members of the media present should note that we need responsible debate in the media at this time on these complex and difficult issues.  It is not easy to explain some of the issues.  I can understand very well the sense of anger over what has occurred, and it is absolutely right to express it.  While I understand the various views and ideas presented, we need to offer the people a sense of security and reassurance to allow for a public debate just at this time that respects different opinions and allows people to give details on what are very complex issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;responsible&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>By &ldquo;responsible&rdquo;, I refer to the way in which we treat one another, and even to our tone of voice and acknowledgement that there may be different views and approaches.  I refer to responsibility that would prevent the debate from degenerating into a very angry one.  I can understand why people are angry but do not believe it will help our people to solve the problem.</P>
        <P>We must be very careful with figures.  It is very easy to state on the radio or in the House that a certain figure is the correct one &mdash; for example, the figure pertaining to the debt interest cost when negotiating with the national bodies.  In respect of such a simple figure, one must recognise there are all sorts of variables to be considered.  One must consider whether there is a variable rate or fixed rate, or a three-year, five-year or ten-year term.  The figure depends very much on which of these factors is taken into account.  We need to be careful of figures and realise that, in complex issues, people need balanced and intelligent debate.</P>
        <P>I have three questions on the four year plan, as published yesterday.  The first concerns debt dynamics, a term I had not heard of until recent years but which is at the very heart of our management of this issue.  I refer to the payment of debt on a sustainable basis over the next four to five years.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore asked the identity of the teams or people representing the Irish people.  I want to answer because it is an important question.  The Department of Finance is leading the negotiations but we are well served by the staff of key agencies, who have public-interest expertise in this area.  I note from my experience of dealing with Mr. John Corrigan, head of the NTMA, that he is highly capable and very straight.  I have never heard figures from him that I believed were incorrect.  The same applies to the new Regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, whom I believe has done a very rigorous job in stress-testing our banks to try to understand the scale of the problem.  He has been joined in this regard by Professor Patrick Honohan.  Central Bank Governors tend not to speak very much in public, and rightly so, but the public has a certain sense that Professor Honohan has expertise.  I have noted others in our system, including the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and the key people in NAMA, who are very capable and very good public servants.  All parties, not just Government parties, can work with them to ensure we understand the issues and achieve a good resolution for the Irish people.</P>
        <P>At this time, in which we are in a particularly precarious position, it may be appropriate to park the valid debate as to whether an alternative approach, such as full nationalisation or an approach based on collapse or default, may have worked two years ago.  At present, we must <Col N="216"/>concentrate on a public debate on what we are doing now.  Debates on alternative approaches are valid and can be engaged in but we need to concentrate on the very difficult and important task now facing us.  We should do so in the debate on the debt dynamics issue.</P>
        <P>Legitimate rage is expressed by those who ask why the taxpayer, rather than the private sector, must pay everything.  That is a valid argument, on which I will outline my thoughts.  The private sector has taken a hit.  Deputy Kenny was not correct in saying that, at every step of the way, the Government looked for the taxpayer to take the hit.  That is not an accurate assessment.  I present as evidence the fact that approximately &euro;40 billion of private-sector capital was wiped out as the banks&rsquo; value was lost.  This has affected many Irish pensioners and savers, who believed they had most secure and solid investments.  For many, this was a really hard loss; it was a private-sector loss.</P>
        <P>To date, bonds worth approximately &euro;7 billion have been lost or written down, and rightly so.  I would like this to be maximised, particularly in the context of protecting taxpayers, where appropriate.  It is not the case, therefore, that taxpayers alone have been footing the bill.  All parties represented in the House would favour a situation where it would not just be taxpayers who shoulder the burden.  In addition, no one wants an approach to be adopted which might appear right and proper in the short term but which might cost us more in the long term.  In that context, we must listen and talk to the members of our negotiating teams who have a good sense of what is required.</P>
        <P>I put it to those opposite that when this most sensitive issue is considered by everyone at the weekend, it is the level of real engagement to which I refer which must be employed in order that we might examine the real options.  We must evaluate, therefore, whether actions which might appear to make real political sense now might actually be disadvantageous in the medium or long term.  That is something which is difficult to do in public.  It is difficult to explain the nature of both bonds and bondholders.  People are being obliged to deal with language which they do not understand.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to understand what constitutes a bondholder.  Descriptions of bondholders vary from speculators to hedge funds to short-term speculators against the State.  However, I am informed &mdash; this can be checked and verified &mdash; that almost all of the senior bondholders in the Irish banks are pension funds and insurance companies.  These entities are not speculators in the sense that they are seeking a quick buck in the short term.  They are actually trying to realise profits on long-term investments.  I would be extremely critical of what occurred in the context of the unchecked flow of capital from&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was irresponsible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The description I have just provided characterises those with whom we are dealing and to some degree it colours our approach to and the action we propose to take in respect of this matter.</P>
        <P>It is critical to ensure that we get our relationship with our European Union partners right.  We must work with our colleagues in the European Union, who have been extremely supportive.  The liquidity the European Central Bank has provided to the State and the guarantee it has advanced in respect of deposits in Irish banks &mdash; which affords to people a real sense of security that those deposits are safe &mdash; shows that the European Union has assisted Ireland.  We must, therefore, work with our European Union partners now in order to ensure that we achieve the right outcome from the difficult negotiations that are taking place.  It is not in the interests of our European Union partners to arrive at a debt repayment amount for the Irish <Col N="217"/>State that is not sustainable.  Our team is negotiating, in co-operation with our European Union colleagues, to ensure that the latter does not happen because it would be in no one&rsquo;s interests.</P>
        <P>We must consider the elements that would be contained in a deal to allow the State to obtain a backstop guarantee in the event that it proves difficult to obtain money from the markets and which will permit the banks obtain capital should it be necessary to do so.  I have been informed that the assessment of the stress tests carried out by Mr. Matthew Elderfield and Professor Patrick Honohan to date shows that there is not a huge iceberg of further losses within the banks.  In light of the scale of the losses to date, some people feared that such an iceberg was looming beneath the surface.  I understand that the stress tests which have been carried out &mdash; the IMF and our European Union partners can check the position in this regard &mdash; have been shown to have produced a picture which is reasonably accurate.</P>
        <P>The need for capital may not be as great as some may fear.  In that context, what we need is a contingency fund.  I have no doubt that some additional moneys will be required in the context of dealing with some of the restructuring that will have to be done in respect of the banks in order to reduce them to a scale which is manageable and which suits the purposes of the Irish economy.  We need to do this quickly and in conjunction with our European partners.  That is why I stated earlier that we do not have a long time.  In effect, we have days.  The contagion effect that has occurred has raised fears in other markets.  As Members are aware, fear feeds on itself.  It is better, therefore, that we should try to take action quickly and in a collaborative way.</P>
        <P>I stand open to correction but I understand that there may have been contacts between the European Union teams and the Opposition parties.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach contacted me and made an offer which I was glad to accept.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the correct approach for the Taoiseach to take.  Members of the public require some sense of security and they need to know that this will not be just a deal that will be concluded on the sidelines.  Public servants are involved in doing the deal.  However, it is important that the political parties in this House, with their sound, solid and honourable traditions, should have an input into the negotiations and should have their say.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Green Party did in the statement it made on Monday last.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to outline the thinking behind what was done on that day.  We all understand the public mood that obtains at present: the deep anger and the great sense of fear.  A number of months ago, my party referred to the need for consensus.  What we did on Monday was an attempt to remove politics from the equation in respect of some of the votes relating to the budget.  I accept that there will be different views on the budget and on the spending allocations that will apply.  That should be the case.  However, what we tried to do was make it clear that voting for the budget would not be a vote for a Government that is <Col N="218"/>going to last forever and a day.  There are time limitations involved here.  The Green Party is of the view that in the aftermath of the key tasks which we must complete, we should face the people and present our alternative strategies.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach stated, the plan before the House will form the framework for certain analyses.  I accept, however, that there may be different views.  Some may question our motivation and our methods.  However, I assure the Deputy that the Green Party&rsquo;s motivation was to try to create an atmosphere in which consensus politics might work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not really work, did it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us give it a try.  That is what the people expect and what they would want at this difficult time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I doubt it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>People have inquired, in the context of the national recovery plan and the partnership model, whether we should have reappraised the Croke Park agreement, etc.  I am of the view that the onus is going to be on management in the public service to ensure that real efficiencies are achieved in order that we will be in a position to do more with less.  It may be easier for us to do this in the spirit of co-operation that was evident from people&rsquo;s willingness to sign up to the Croke Park agreement rather than in trying to break down the latter and formulate a more efficient system in some other way.  That is my personal view.  It will be a crucial task for whomever is in government in the coming years to manage the public service reform process.  I am of the opinion that the latter should be done by using the process of partnership which has worked to the country&rsquo;s benefit in the past which everyone would recognise had its failings.</P>
        <P>In the context of social partnership, it is incredibly difficult to make decisions to cut social welfare payments and so forth.  If there are other ways in which we might manage the reduction in the budget spend and increase revenues in order to bridge the &euro;15 billion gap that exists &mdash; which is something the two main parties in opposition want to see happen &mdash; I would love someone to identify them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Government&rsquo;s job to identify such ways.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>We have not been involved in any of what has gone on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Members should allow the Minister to continue with his contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I absolutely agree that it is our job to do so.  However, it is not an easy job.  If there are alternative or different ways of proceeding, I would be open to their being outlined in order that we might evaluate how they might work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government did not search very hard for alternatives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of growth, a strategic decision was taken to protect enterprise, investment and education in the budget.  These three areas are key to encouraging growth.  We need to make our debt dynamics work.  A development which has been of assistance in recent weeks is the fact that the matter of our 12.5% corporation tax rate has been placed on the back burner.  I commend our French and German colleagues on recognising that this is not the time to introduce fundamental changes to our approach to enterprise, which <Col N="219"/>continues to work to our benefit.  We will need to adhere to that approach in order that we might, in the interests of this State and those of the wider eurozone, extricate ourselves from our economic difficulties.</P>
        <P>Investing in enterprise, an area in which we have real strengths and capabilities and people with real skills, will allow us to create the type of growth that will assist in allowing us to emerge from our current difficulties.  A great deal of this investment will go to the green economy.  Deputy Bruton inquired earlier about investment plans relating to the smart grid, green energy and broadband.  He is correct in identifying these areas because they are critical in the context of the action we need to take.  State companies and those which operate the grid are making significant investments that will assist the economy in turning the corner.  As a result of this, electricity and gas prices are decreasing and this will provide us with a competitive advantage.  The development of renewables is bringing down the price of electricity here, which, according to the report, is the sixth cheapest among our comparator countries in the EU.  Progress is being made.  There is a growth opportunity, particularly in the green economy and in areas such as retrofit where we may use new funding mechanisms to help pay our way.</P>
        <P>I understand Deputy Gilmore when he asks if there is risk in terms of a figure being so large that it has a deflationary effect, but I listened to the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, yesterday and he made sense to me.  Unfortunately, we must get back to single figures.  We would be the only eurozone country not doing so and that is the dynamic which requires a &euro;6 billion adjustment.  I believe it can be done in a way that does not deflate the economy and that there is a pent-up skill and enterprise opportunity in this country that is very real.  It needs a functioning banking system, it needs a wee bit of confidence back, but the capability, ingenuity and sense of inventiveness and enterprise of the Irish people is real.  Even where we are contracting the public service, I believe there is an alternative expansion that can occur in the domestic economy that will make up for that and we can work our way through this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has one minute remaining.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not easy.  It is scary.  However, as my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, stated on Monday last, we have a duty of care.  Our party is willing to contribute to ensure we get through this difficult period &mdash; get through the budget, get through the negotiations that we must conclude with our European colleagues and give the country a sense of confidence.</P>
        <P>I believe we will do that better through as much consensus as possible among all the parties in this House.  It does not mean agreeing on everything or compromising on anything.  That sort of open debate and honesty is what the people seek as we head towards a very difficult few days and weeks.  My sense on meeting Deputies of different parties here over the past week or so is that they share that view and I hope our debate here takes place in that spirit because it is what the people are looking for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Sinn F&eacute;in wants national recovery for Ireland.  We will do everything in our power to strive day and night for that objective, to serve the real national interest, and to work side by side with the Irish people in communities up and down the length and breadth of this country.  That is what we stand for.  That is what we have always stood for.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For that reason, because we have the national interest at heart, we want recovery and we believe there is a better way forward, we must oppose the so-called national recovery plan published yesterday by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.  This is not a plan for national recovery.  It is a plan for national impoverishment.  It is a savage plan which will force the people to pay dearly for what I described yesterday, and I make no apology for repeating it here today, as the economic treason committed by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.</P><Col N="220"/>
        <P>This Government has no right to impose such a plan on the people.  The D&aacute;il should be dissolved now on the plan&rsquo;s publication, the budget should be suspended and there should be a general election.  It is a travesty of democracy that a four year plan should be framed by the most reviled Government in the history of this State, a Government whose life is now measured in weeks.</P>
        <P>It is a plan delivered by a Cabinet, which, by the admission of its two Green Party members, including the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who has just spoken, has misled and betrayed the Irish people.  Yet the leader of the Green Party stood beside the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance yesterday and lauded this four year plan to high heaven, having already handed in his party&rsquo;s notice to quit.  It would be a pantomime if it were not so tragic.  If the Ministers, Deputy Gormley and Deputy Ryan, and their colleagues believe so much in this plan, why are they not staying in Government to implement it?</P>
        <P>The truth is that we have a threefold democratic crisis as well as a political crisis.  First, the State is being sold out to the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and international money-lenders, and what remains of our economic sovereignty is being destroyed.  Clearly, it is an attack on Irish democracy.  Second, a Government with no mandate purports to impose on the people a four year plan, an IMF-ECB deal and a budget for 2011.  Third, the two so-called main Opposition parties, Fine Gael and Labour, have bought into the doomed strategy on which this plan is based.  Despite all their rhetoric of the past three years and their repeated votes of no confidence in the Government and the Taoiseach, they cannot tell us whether they will vote to stop the budget on 7 December and to stop this plan.  That is critical information not only for this House, but for their respective electorates and the people across the State.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in stands clearly in opposition to the Government, this plan and the Government&rsquo;s budgetary intent.  We have shown that there is an alternative to the consensus for cuts.  We have put forward rational, costed proposals to reduce the deficit through raising and saving revenue, to retain and create jobs through a major stimulus package and to protect public services and social supports.  Similar proposals have been put forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, by the community and voluntary sector and by many economists, all of whom have shown that there is a better, fairer way.  I totally reject the arrogant assertion by the Minister for Finance yesterday that anything put forward in the next general election and not based in this plan is nonsense.  That is an outrageous statement on the part of a Minister for Finance at the conclusion of the announcement of the detail of this plan.</P>
        <P>In his budget speech in December last, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, like a British general in First World War circumstances, told us that the worst was over and that the budget represented one &ldquo;last big push&rdquo;.  Now, like those same generals, the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues have refused to learn the lesson of their failed strategy and are sending the Irish people over the top once again into no-man&rsquo;s land &mdash; perhaps it should be NAMA land &mdash; to be cannon fodder for the banks, the ECB and the IMF.  Shame on the Minister and the Government.</P>
        <P>Despite the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s appeals, and the appeals of the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, here this morning on the part of the Green Party, my party will not be signing up to their plan.  What we need now is a dissolution of this D&aacute;il, a general election to be held immediately and then, in the new D&aacute;il, a progressive budget that will be part of a real plan for national recovery and that will have the confidence and support of the Irish people as a whole.</P><Col N="221"/>
        <P>We also need a total change in banking policy.  This is at the heart of all our ills.  There can be no national recovery while the Government&rsquo;s criminal and treacherous banking policy continues.  The structural deficit of this State can be dealt with, not in the way this so-called national recovery plan suggests, but through the measures that we in Sinn F&eacute;in and others have set out in our pre-budget submission and in other contributions from a variety of sources.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Government is about to embark on what can only be described as an insane course of borrowing to fund a failed banking policy.  We cannot afford this banking policy or this loan.  We need real negotiators to deal with the banks and to burn the bondholders.  Otherwise, this and future generations will be saddled with a debt that should never have been incurred and for which, clearly, they are not responsible.  Not a euro more should go into the Irish banks until their debts are restructured, whether through burning the bondholders or giving them &mdash; we can consider it &mdash; debt-for-equity swaps.  If the Government proceeds with its banking plan its so-called recovery plan is redundant day one.</P>
    
        <P>This plan aims to make an adjustment of &euro;15 billion over four years.  This is a figure that sits in splendid isolation from the &euro;85 billion currently being negotiated for the bank bailout in Government Buildings.  The addition of that &euro;85 billion to the State&rsquo;s sovereign debt will incur debt servicing of huge proportions over the coming years, amounts that we simply cannot afford.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The premise of the plan itself is fundamentally wrong, even apart from the banking elephant in the room.  In the past two years, the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government has taken &euro;14.5 billion out of the economy through spending cuts and tax increases.  Where has it got us?  The recession is worse now.  Yet, under this plan, it wants to take another &euro;15 billion out of the economy up to 2014.</P>
        <P>In pursuit of this doomed strategy, low to middle income families are to be hit with pay cuts, social welfare cuts, water charges, local service charges and a flat-rate home tax.  This is absolutely incredible.  Health, education and other public services are to be savagely hit.  This is an attack on the low paid and it cannot be described in any other way.  The plan simultaneously lowers the minimum wage and brings people on the minimum wage into the tax net.  The minimum wage is to be reduced by &euro;1 per hour, which means a person on the minimum wage would earn &euro;15,500 a year, while the tax band has been reduced to &euro;15,300.</P>
        <P>In total contrast to the attack on the low paid there is no increase in the tax rate for the highest earners.  Listen to this fact; it is clear that people have noted it well.  This is in accordance with the belief of the Minister for Finance that a higher top rate of tax would lead to higher earners fleeing the jurisdiction.  He is not worried about our young people fleeing the jurisdiction in what can only be described as a new wave of emigration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The standard VAT rate is to rise from 21% to 23% in 2014.  This is a further grievous blow to trade and commerce, most especially in the southern Border counties.  The counties of Cavan and Monaghan which I am proud to represent have been very badly hit in recent years by the flow of shoppers across the Border to the Six Counties.  Today, voters in Donegal South-West go to the polls.  Their local economy is to be punished further if this plan is implemented, and the same goes for counties Louth, Sligo and Leitrim in the front first line.  This is what we have come to expect from a Government that has repeatedly overlooked the economic needs of the Border counties and that has no plan, and no interest in a plan, to remove the distortions created by the Border and to create an all-Ireland economy.  There is where solutions to many of our problems can be found.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The cuts to health and children in the plan are truly frightening.  They confirm the threat of the Minister for Health and Children to impose cuts of more than &euro;600 million in the coming year.  Our public health services simply cannot sustain this savagery.  Staff and services will be <Col N="222"/>slashed and patients will suffer.  This is set to cause long-term and more sustained damage than the cuts of the 1980s.  We await with trepidation the further details that will present in the budget and in its outworking over the period afterwards.</P>
        <P>Unbelievably, the leader of the Green Party boasted at yesterday&rsquo;s press conference that the Green Party had defended education in the plan.  That is some claim and some defence.  Children are to be hit with a reduction of 5% in capitation grants for their schools.  This will again penalise the least advantaged schools which are more dependent on Department of Education and Skills support.  Higher student fees will make third level education far more inaccessible, penalising intelligent and hard-working young people and denying them the opportunity to contribute to our society because they and their families simply cannot afford to send them to college.  So much for the knowledge economy that we hear about so much from Government voices.</P>
        <P>This has been a sad and tragic week for Ireland.  A week ago the Governor of the Central Bank confirmed that the IMF was coming.  People are outraged that our ability to determine our own affairs has been so undermined by the Government.  Ba mhaith liom cr&iacute;och a chur leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; le r&aacute; agam.

        <P>The national recovery plan has been published as negotiations for Ireland&rsquo;s entry into an EU and IMF programme for financial support are taking place.  The plan has been in preparation since October.  It is our plan for this country and it will work.  Unusually for a country that is seeking external support, Ireland is funded to the middle of next year, our economy has stabilised and we are moving into a balance of payments surplus.</P>
        <P>As the plan points out, recovery in our economy is beginning to take shape.  Our underlying budget deficit has stabilised at 11.7% of GDP and will decline to just above 9% next year.  Our tax revenues are slightly ahead of target so far this year and our spending is being contained.  It is now expected that GDP will record a small increase this year on the back of strong export growth.  Our exports have held remarkably well through out the downturn.  They are expected to grow by 6% in real terms this year.</P>
        <P>This growth is coming not just from the multinationals.  Our indigenous exporters are also growing their market share, so it is a broadly based recovery in exports that is being driven by a pick-up in demand in our trading partners and also by the significant improvements in our competitiveness over the past two years.  The measures on cost competitiveness contained in the plan will build on the improvements that have already taken place and strengthen the position of our companies in the market place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Conditions in the labour market are beginning to stabilise.  Unemployment is unacceptably high at 13.6% but the number on the live register has fallen for two consecutive months for the first time since 2007.  At the end of the lifetime of the plan, we expect unemployment to have fallen below 10%.  Our balance of payments will record a small surplus next year, meaning the economy as a whole is paying down external debt.  We are beginning to pay our way in the world.</P>
        <P>All of these data paint a picture of an economy that is returning to growth after a deep and prolonged recession.  The purpose of this national recovery plan is to plot a course to sound, sustainable growth for our economy.  The plan will dispel uncertainty and reinforce the confidence of consumers, businesses, and the international community.  Taxpayers have the benefit of knowing that the changes in income tax over the life of the plan will bring us to levels we last saw as recently as 2006.</P>
        <P>The site value tax to be paid by all householders will be introduced next year and will amount to an average of &euro;200 per household by the end of the plan, and a maximum of &euro;100 for a large number of households.  The certainty the plan gives to taxpayers about the tax they will pay over the next four years will enable them to plan their investments and give them the confidence to spend in this economy.  The revenue measures in the plan will reform and overhaul our system, broaden its base and provide revenue stability so that we can raise the resources we need to pay for our public services.  It is estimated that this year, 45% of income earners will pay no tax.  This is unsustainable.  A fundamental principle of the reform contained in the plan is that all taxpayers must contribute according to their means.  Those who can pay most will pay most.  No group can be sheltered.  The wholesale abolition and curtailment of tax expenditures, with a saving of &euro;735 million, will ensure that high income earners will pay their full rate of tax.  The reduction of tax relief on pensions over the period of the plan is also more equitable, because the relief is now available to all at the standard rate.</P>
        <P>We know from our experience as well as from international evidence that a broadly based tax system is more conducive to economic growth.  The plan is concerned not just with the quantity of the revenue raised, but also with the quality of the measures adopted so that at the end of the plan&rsquo;s lifetime, we will have a tax system that serves an advanced, growing economy.  Our tax system will continue to incentivise work, entrepreneurship and innovation and our 12.5% corporation tax will remain unchanged.</P><Col N="224"/>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in intervened with regard to the position of the Border counties and their exposure for cross-Border trade.  I agree that is an important issue and that is the reason firm and decisive action was taken on it in last year&rsquo;s budget.  It is clear from VAT receipts this year that decision has had a productive effect in terms of the generation of trade on this side of the Border.  However, I take note of what the Deputy has said in this regard and that is why the planned increases in VAT are left to a later period in the plan.  Similar sales taxes in the United Kingdom are seeing substantial increases currently and we have given enough leeway in the plan to ensure an alignment can always take place between the relative rates of taxation on both sides of the Border.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our day-to-day spending will be reduced by &euro;7 billion over the next four years, bringing us back to 2007 levels.  The number of public servants will be reduced by nearly 25,000 by 2014, bringing us back to levels last seen in 2005.  We will not allow this reduction in numbers to be detrimental to the quality of our public services.  Reforms to boost the efficiency and productivity of the public service will be delivered in accordance with the commitments contained in the Croke Park agreement.</P>
        <P>The reductions in expenditure are focused on the areas of greatest cost, public sector pay and pensions, social welfare and programmes such as the public capital programme.  I have listened since this crisis began to Deputies talking about making savings from efficiencies.  Of course we can do that, and we will.  However, it is simply dishonest to suggest that we can right our economic ills without taking difficult decisions affecting the main drivers of public expenditure.  Over the past two years we have made substantial adjustments through tax increases and expenditure changes, amounting to &euro;14.6 billion.  These succeeded in stabilising the underlying budget deficit this year.  There is still a substantial amount of ground to be made up and the plan provides the measures to achieve this.  Social welfare spending, which increased two and a half fold during the boom years, will be reduced by &euro;2.8 billion.  The available resources will be concentrated on those most in need.  The system will be reformed to ensure it does not create poverty traps and disincentives to work and control measures will be intensified to assist in achieving the necessary savings.  Capital spending must also provide savings.  We have made significant investment in our infrastructure over the past decade and it has been transformed.  In the current environment, it should be possible to deliver better value from a lower level of capital investment.</P>
        <P>The main elements of expenditure reductions will be as follows.  There will be a reduction in the cost of the public sector pay and pensions bill, social welfare and public service programmes.  Savings will be achieved  in social welfare expenditure through structural reform measures, labour activation and, as a last resort, reduced payment rates.  Public service numbers will be cut by 24,500, 8%, compared to end-2008 levels.  The public sector pay bill will be reduced by approximately &euro;1.2 billion by 2014.  For new entrants to the public service, there will be a reformed pension scheme and a 10% reduction in their pay.  There will be more effective use of staff resources, through redeployment within and across sectors of the public service to meet priority needs.  Work practices will be reformed to provide more efficient public services with scarcer resources.  The student contribution to third level education will be increased.  Water metering will be introduced by 2014 and the budget system will be reformed and updated, starting with budget 2011.</P>
        <P>Careful choices have been made in determining expenditure for the next four years and these have been guided by the need to provide public services while at the same time ensuring that we return to growth.  Investment in education, innovation and enterprise will be maintained at high levels to foster the growth potential in our economy.  The labour market will be reformed to remove barriers to job creation.  The minimum wage will be reduced and a short and focused <Col N="225"/>review of the employment agreements that apply in the agricultural, catering and construction sectors is under way to ensure that these agreements do not endanger jobs or prevent the creation of new jobs, particularly for our younger people.</P>
        <P>Measures to reduce the cost of doing business are also contained in the plan.  It also contains a number of specific actions tailored to assist the sectors of our economy which will deliver growth in the medium term.  The plan is not just about cutting the budget deficit.  We must demonstrate how we will achieve growth and my colleague, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, the Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation will outline and elaborate on this aspect of the plan in the coming days.  Long-term sustainable growth will be export led, but domestic demand is also critical to sustainable growth.</P>
        <P>I want to make specific reference to the impact of any assistance package we may agree.  First, the size of any programme is not finally decided, but an amount of approximately &euro;85 billion has been mentioned.  Whatever amount is agreed, it will not all be drawn down at once.  The final amount is not an addition to the national debt figures in the plan.  The level of funds available will allow us to replace borrowing which would have had to be undertaken in any event, if that was necessary.  As far as banking is concerned, no particular level of drawdown has been agreed, but the fund is intended to be large enough to deal with all possible outcomes.  The interest rate is not yet set.  It will be an average rate given the different rates which will apply to the funds from different sources.  The calculation of the interest rate is technical and complex and this work has not yet been completed.  Therefore any interest rate mentioned at this time is speculative.</P>
        <P>On the issue of bank reorganisation, the percentage ownership of any bank after this recapitalisation will depend on a number of factors not yet decided, including the amount of capital and whether any of it can be obtained from other sources.  While various options for reorganisation of the banks have been discussed, no decisions have yet been made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The suggestion that the plan is invalid because we have not factored information that we do not yet have is nonsense.  The reform proposals and the fiscal measures must be fulfilled, whatever the outcome of our current discussions with the IMF and the EU.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to refer to the commentary on our macro-economic projections.  Some have said we are being too optimistic, while others say we are overly conservative.  I prefer to see the forecasts as prudent, balancing, optimistic and conservative assumptions.  By providing certainty to consumers, the plan will build the confidence the economy so badly needs.  That confidence will impact on domestic demand and expand employment in those sectors that serve retail demand, such as retailing, catering and construction.  It is important for all of us to recall that this economy has had strong balanced growth in the past.  This plan provides a path for us to achieve it again.  The plan is fair and proportionate.  It asks us to take more responsibility for ourselves, for the financing of our public services and for the payment of our children&rsquo;s college education.  It concentrates welfare spending on those most in need and provides resources for public services to be delivered in an efficient and cost effective manner.  It is a rational and sensible plan to bring us out of the steep downturn from which we are now beginning to emerge.  We must all work together to implement it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his observations.  I found the plan very disappointing.  I was expecting a magnum opus, but we did not get it.  Like many people who have watched the development of this particular crisis through its final stages to the appeal to Europe for bailout funds last Sunday night, I thought there would be a heavy section on bank restructuring in the plan.  That was what I looked for first when I received a copy of the plan.  However, the plan is silent on banking.  There is a reference on page 24 to the strengths of the Irish economy, one of which strengths is claimed to be the ready availability of a good flow of <Col N="226"/>credit.  Somebody must have discovered that while on holiday because it is not apparent in this country.</P>
        <P>The Minister may say he will deal with the banking crisis or that he will make an announcement on bank restructuring shortly but my primary criticism is that the cost of servicing the bank bailout is not included in the plan.  When challenged on this in a television interview, he stated that he was including everything up to 30 September 2010 but I do not know what interest rate will be applied to the bailout funds.</P>
        <P>The rumours would suggest that the interest will be unaffordable.  Even if we applied a simpler rate based on standard IMF charges of 5%, the cost over two years of the estimated &euro;10 billion needed for recapitalising AIB and Bank of Ireland would be &euro;2 billion.  The correction of &euro;15 billion should, therefore, be &euro;17 billion.  The failure to include this interest is a serious flaw in a plan that is supposed to inspire confidence across Europe&rsquo;s bond markets.  A first year economics student would immediately notice this flaw after a quick read.  I cannot understand how the plan could be published on that basis when such a flaw is apparent so quickly.</P>
        <P>The plan is disappointing in regard to a growth strategy.  The House and the public are familiar by now with Fine Gael&rsquo;s position.  It is not enough to commit to fiscal correction.  We are committed to the targets published in the plan but we would also pursue a parallel strategy of jobs and growth.  The plan, however, contains the Government&rsquo;s usual scissors and paste copies of extracts and concepts it announced many times in the past in Dublin Castle, the media centre or down the road at the convention centre.  It proposes the same old platitudes and shibboleths.  The smart economy is to be organised by the greatest bunch of dummies who ever sat in Cabinet.  They are going to major on bright ideas.</P>

	<P>The fundamental concepts of running an element of a stimulus package in parallel and, more importantly, taking a series of supply side initiatives on a sectoral basis to maximise growth and job creation are not in the plan.  How many times have we argued that we could get more out of the manufacturing industry if the competitiveness agenda promoted by Dr. Don Thornhill was introduced?  The Government commits to the competitiveness agenda in this plan, just as it did last year and in previous years, but the reports are put on the shelf and nothing ever happens.  Even when it has the right ideas, it has not a clue about implementing them.  There is nothing on information technology, research and development, pharmaceuticals or the food industry.  Even in the tourism sector, the Government has such a grievance with Michael O&rsquo;Leary that it cannot see the sense in abolishing the travel tax in order to bring tourists into the country.  We have five star hotels, magnificent golf courses, beautiful scenery and the best of self-catering accommodation.  Our main roads will bring tourists from one side of the country to the other in jig time.</P>

The same applies to hotels, bars and restaurants.  I do not know what country he is living in if he thinks the Government is doing a good job on tourism.  If we attracted 100,000 extra tourists we could earn more income than what we get from the travel tax.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The public service reform section of the plan is weak when compared with Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s document on reinventing politics.  Again, the Government does a magician&rsquo;s trick by claiming the numbers employed in the public service will be reduced by 24,750 based on 2008 levels.  If one works from 2010, however, the reduction will only be 12,000 out of 300,000, or 3,000 per year over the lifetime of the plan.  How is that a plan for reducing public service numbers?</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s entire strategy for the public service is very weak.  A functioning and motivated public service will be crucial to revitalising this country but the plan is very tentative in this regard.  We will face additional taxes and cuts to front-line services because it is so lame on public service reform.  Everything is joined together in public administration and we will pay elsewhere for an overly heavy public service.</P>
        <P>The labour market initiatives are very weak.  The plan waves the flag of abolishing the minimum wage to impress the bond markets of Europe.  Thank God, nearly 1.9 million people continue to work in Ireland and fewer than 4% of these are on the minimum wage.  Minimum wage earners are for the most part young people, students or immigrant labourers.  They are all vulnerable and this measure will do nothing for them.  There are other ways to address the issue.  In speaking about labour market initiatives several weeks ago, the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, put it succinctly when he stated that his primary objective is to ensure work is always more valuable than welfare.  The first thing one should consider is tax on work.  If, for <Col N="228"/>example, we reduced employers&rsquo; PRSI contribution, we would get a better bang for our buck than reducing the minimum wage.  The real issue is the poverty trap.  We must make it easy for people to move into and out of the workforce.  Leaving aside temporary blips, it must always be worthwhile over the long term for an individual to go to work rather than stay on welfare.  Once that principle is applied, we can get labour market initiatives up and running and we will not have to touch the most vulnerable in society.</P>
        <P>When this debate started six months ago, Fine Gael laid out two principles for fiscal correction, which we acknowledged was necessary.  The first principle is that it should be fair across society, with no easy ride for friends of the Government in the Galway tent.  The second principle is that it should protect the most vulnerable.  Those on the minimum wage are vulnerable people and they should be protected.</P>
        <P>The provisions on pensions are narrow in focus and they run counter to the submissions made by the industry.  The effect of reducing tax relief to the standard rate of 20% will be to discourage people from making provision for their pensions.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">It will be ordinary middle-income people who will be discouraged from making provision for their pensions.  It is being presented as the people at the top of salary scales, with enormous amounts of money, who will put big chunks of that money into pension funds.  However, in that small minority of jobs where people are paid extravagant amounts, those people are key to their workplaces and they will negotiate a package where the company will make the pension contribution rather than the individual.  At a 12.5% rate, which is being preserved, the company will get tax relief on the pension contribution and the individual will pay the standard rate, but big chunks of money will still go into pension funds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The alternative approach is to cap the funds at approximately &euro;1.5 million and cap the contribution at somewhere between &euro;40,000 and &euro;50,000 &mdash; I will not nominate an exact figure &mdash; then continue with the tax relief and put a temporary levy on the fund.  If a temporary levy is put on the fund for the duration of the plan, there is a very significant yield but actuaries will not take it into account when calculating the actual value of the fund because it is temporary.  If one considers the literature produced by those companies like Zurich or Irish Life &amp; Permanent, which are very strong in the market, this is the formula they are opting for.  It is very easy to collect the levy because the pension industry is collecting management fees already, and all it has to do is to collect the 0.5% levy on top of the management fee and send it to Revenue.</P>
        <P>It would be a better model.  This model will not work because it discourages people from taking out pensions.  I am not sure what it will yield because many people will discontinue their contributions if it is done this way.  Again, we have a disagreement on the specific in this regard.</P>
        <P>There is always an argument for increasing VAT but it is one of the flaws in the plan that the Government is taking individual decisions without restructuring.  Again, it is as with the case of public service reform.  The Government should be restructuring because it is by restructuring that it will get the economy moving again.  When it decided to increase VAT by two points, it should have reduced the lower VAT rate of 13.5%.  If the standard of VAT is increased by 1% and the 13.5% rate is reduced to 10%, there would still be some &euro;200 million to &euro;250 million going into the Exchequer.  The Government should have used the opportunity to reform VAT rather than just state we are taking the increases for revenue collection.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nobody likes VAT increases and the retail sector is under pressure at present.  However, much of that to which the 21% VAT rate applies is imported whereas the 13.5% rate applies to the newspaper industry, the building industry and the food section of the hospitality industry, which includes restaurants, bars and so on.  All of those sectors are major employers in the economy.  If the Government is looking at supply side initiatives across sectors to get the <Col N="229"/>economy moving and create more jobs, a restructuring of VAT rather than an increase is the better way to do it.</P>
        <P>The Government signalled forward the VAT announcement, as it has with everything in the plan.  It states it is not bringing in any VAT increase in 2011.  The economic reason for signalling tax increases forward has always been to change behaviour, for example, people will go out and buy the washing machine, fridge or car before the increase comes in.  What we need more than anything else at present is consumer confidence to get things moving again.  If a market economist was looking at this and saw we were increasing VAT, the advice would be to change the two points at the same time in 2012, which would increase it to 23%, and to announce this now to try to get consumption going in 2011, when it will be badly needed and when the Government is predicting a growth rate of 1.75%, whereas in 2012 it is predicting a growth rate of 3.5%.  To do that would get consumer spending moving.</P>
        <P>I do not know what Fine Gael&rsquo;s decision will be in this regard.  I am outlining the theory of changing tax rates such as VAT, and what works and does not work, as well as the difference between taking a series of individual decisions and taking reasoned decisions where one is trying to restructure tax rates to get a change in behaviour and a boost in the economy.</P>
        <P>A big chunk of money will be taken out of social welfare.  In general terms with regard to tax and social welfare, the tax corrections are front-loaded, with 65% of the income tax adjustments being taken next Tuesday week in the budget.  However, the social welfare adjustments, which are more politically sensitive, are back-loaded.  This is interesting in terms of getting the budget through the D&aacute;il.  We all know that on budget night there will be a series of financial resolutions but they concern tax increases.  I have yet to hear a Deputy who supports the Government say he or she will vote against the Government on the basis of a tax increase.  Fianna F&aacute;il was always happy to raise taxes and it does not regard it as a no-go area.  I presume that by doing it this way, budget night is looking increasingly safe.</P>
        <P>If one considers the tables at the back of the plan, however, and the rolling budget for social welfare, one will see there is a small increase in the social welfare budget shown for 2011.  I am not suggesting the Government will not do anything in this regard.  Clearly, extra people will come in to the welfare net through unemployment.  Following this, there is to be a big drop in 2012 and another in 2013.  It seems the Government is organising its welfare adjustments as a legacy from a kind uncle to the incoming Government, and it is hoping there will be no key votes on budget night.</P>
</Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister replies, he might tell us what specific welfare adjustments he intends for the Social Welfare Bill before Christmas and how much he is leaving behind out of the kindness of his heart as adjustments for an incoming Government.</P>
        <P>The cuts in expenditure are revealing.  The political discussion in Cabinet was clearly centered on what to do on taxation and on welfare.  I am sure that is well specified, although the full hand has not been shown in the plan.  The expenditure profiles for 2011 have been carefully worked out because it would not be possible to bring in a credible budget without them.  This is like the residue of a will.  There is a big chunk of expenditure cuts, approximately &euro;7.5 billion, which are effectively unspecified and have no policy decisions underpinning them.  There is just a series of departmental tables taking out chunks of money.  This is a clever way of doing it but if anybody thinks in analysing this document that it explains how &euro;15 billion in savings will be arrived at, it does not; it explains about half of it.  The other half refers only to, say, the Department of Health and Children or the Department of Defence where it will be a case of removing a big sum of money.  It is revealing of the process which went on in Government.</P><Col N="230"/>
        <P>I have two other points to make on the global figures.  First, it seems the correction is not &euro;6 billion but &euro;5.3 billion because &euro;700 million is included for the sale of State assets.  This is clever, and I presume it has the permission of the Commission.  This sum is being transferred across as a dividend to the Exchequer so it can be included in the figure.  Therefore, &euro;6 billion is now &euro;5.3 billion, which will be good news for the Labour Party as it is coming down towards its &euro;4.5 billion.  They are closing the gap.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The other point is that I do not know what is the opening position.  If the race starts from the line, it is 100 yards, but if the race starts ten yards up the field, it is only 90 yards.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct, and we do not know the starting position either.  The Government has been under-spending the capital budget and it has been getting in a little extra in taxation for the first ten months of the year.  If the race starts at &euro;500 million, then up the line the &euro;5.3 billion figure will fall a little and the adjustment will be smaller.  It is like the secrets of Fatima until we see the tables on budget day.  However, I would not take anything at face value from this Government because I have been misled too often.  We will have to go through everything very carefully.</P>

I want to tell those clever anonymous spokespersons from the European institutions that the way we behave here is governed by the European treaties and they should not advocate solutions for Ireland that are beyond the scope of the treaties.  There will be a new Government, whatever its composition may be.  I do not believe a new Government should be tied to the specifics of a plan negotiated by an outgoing Government that has lost all credibility at home and abroad.  I want to tell the Commission straight out that will not work.  We are committed to the targets but not to the specifics.  If the budget goes through obviously that will change the status of the specifics for 2011 but for the subsequent years we will sit down with the Commission and renegotiate specifics.  We will not accept any other arrangement from the Commission.</P>
        <P>My final remark concerns the euro.  The euro brought wealth to Ireland.  It was a great idea and it helped trade and the economy.  It also brought a wash of cheap credit to Ireland which <Col N="231"/>did not suit our position in the economic cycle, caused us a great deal of grief and was a big contributory factor to the bubble.  I do not believe the eurozone has been developed as a proper fiscal zone.  One may look at the system in the United States which has automatic stabilisers for when things go wrong in a particular state and where there can be fiscal flows from one part of the country to another to maintain an economy.</P>
        <P>The eurozone is a very undeveloped common currency area that must be developed further.  I do not believe that addressing fiscal imbalances in the peripheral states and deflating them is going to stabilize it.  The big countries such as Germany and France have a responsibility to get demand going in the economy.  Why do they not cut their taxes, get consumer spending going and give us a chance to export to them?  Was not the entire basis of the new Europe that there would be an interchange, with countries buying and selling to each other to get the economy going?  The view advocated by the policy makers in Europe is incredibly narrow and I do not believe it will work.  There is no point in blaming Ireland because the euro is under pressure.  The euro is under pressure because it has fundamental flaws in its composition.</P>

	<P>I have a last sentence.  It is probably not known in this country that Germany has gained a lot from the crisis.  German bonds are a safe haven for the savings of Europeans, particularly in peripheral countries.  A reasonable calculation would suggest that German debt servicing has gone down by between &euro;15 billion and &euro;20 billion since the start of this crisis because of the inflow of funds from elsewhere.  This pitch is very uneven at present and I am growing increasingly concerned about the weight of what is being imposed on Ireland and the lack of understanding, in particular, on the part of the European institutions although the IMF, which has experience in this area, seems to be taking a more tolerant view.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The principal lord of misrule in regard to the disaster that has overtaken the Irish economy might be identified as Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Although he is still a Member of this House and is frequently reported as having speaking engagements in the Panama Canal area and around the world, he has remained silent in terms of explaining himself to the House, to his own political party or to the people.  However, he gave an interview recently for a new book by David. J. Lynch, which I believe is aimed at Irish-Americans and people in the United States to help them understand what has gone wrong in Ireland.  I wish to read part of the interview into the record of the House because I believe it to be a genuine expression of the voice of Deputy Ahern, as he once misruled this country.  In explanation for the disaster he states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">At any time, had they come in and put the doomsday message I think we could have done a lot of things.  But there was no sense, I can tell ya, of that.  I mean, there wasn&rsquo;t one meeting with the Central Bank guys, not one meeting where they were putting the red lights on.  Not one meeting.  And never did Brian Cowen or the finance officials come over to me to say that the whole thing, the bottom, was going to fall out.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I know Deputy Bertie Ahern.  That is so much his true and authentic voice.  However, it also shows his cleverness.  It is a crushing indictment of the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and of his anointed heir and successor, the present Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen.  That is the voice he wishes to leave on the history book records, never being a man not to get his retaliation in and to explain the situation in his own way.</P>
        <P>It was crony capitalism that brought us to this &mdash; that golden circle of Fianna F&aacute;il, the lord of misrule in the Galway tent and the bankers like Seanie FitzPatrick.  Mr. FitzPatrick gave a lecture &mdash; an actual lecture &mdash; a year or so before we began to become familiar, in a way none <Col N="232"/>of us would ever have wished for, with the inner workings of Anglo Irish Bank.  In his lecture, Mr. FitzPatrick, as became a mega-billionnaire, lectured us that financial regulation in Ireland was the new McCarthyism.  Shortly afterwards, he lectured the Irish Government, saying that old age pensioners and others should take cut after cut.  We were all young and naive then, in the early days of the financial crisis and the collapse of the banks.  Although I predicted the collapse of the bubble and was the first person to raise the Quinn affair, contracts for difference and the property based tax breaks, which are all on my record in the D&aacute;il, I never thought the wrongdoings and the bust model of Anglo Irish Bank would bring down not only AIB but possibly Bank of Ireland.  This week, despite all its efforts and despite the rights issue, it is almost back to where it was before.  It gives me no pleasure to say that.</P>
        <P>There, however, is the voice of Deputy Bertie Ahern.  He comes in and votes in the House but never speaks although in his paid lectures he tells the world that the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen told him nothing.  The Department of Finance officials also told him nothing.  The Central Bank told him nothing.</P>
        <P>What would a manager in any company do?  He or she would say, &ldquo;Sack the lot of them.&rdquo;  The Government has brought such incredible destruction to this country.  This is what faces the Taoiseach more than anybody else.  Where is the honour in continuing when it created this disaster?  As early as 2006 I had a big argument with the now Taoiseach over contracts for difference and turning the Dublin Stock Exchange into a casino.  Little did I know that today Paddy Power bookmakers is a bigger element on the Irish Stock Exchange than our banks.  That tells all about the Celtic tiger which has turned into the Celtic tortoise.  That is why people are so angry.</P>
        <P>David McWilliams, in his book <i>The Pope&rsquo;s Children</i> and a recent book about the crash refers to insiders and outsiders in this country.  In a way, the four year plan is about insiders and outsiders.  The outsiders are the little people, who have endless capacity and energy to take it on the chin and who can have a cut in the minimum wage.  There is no requirement as a <i>quid pro quo</i> that their bosses, whether in the public or private sector &mdash; the minimum wage is mostly a matter for the private sector &mdash; should also limit their compensation packages on a parallel with what people on the lowest wage are being asked to take.</P>
        <P>During the Dublin Theatre Festival I went to see &ldquo;Enron&rdquo;, by a London company, in the Gaiety.  It told the story of a massive energy company which became one of the biggest financial empires in the United States and which, in its destruction, has brought, among others, the state of California close to financial ruin.  However, as it is in the continental US federal system it will not bring down the dollar even though it is one of the bigger states.  The play told the story of Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive and chief accountant.  The audience comprised mostly young people from banks, insurance companies and business houses who went to the theatre after work.  There was a fantastic atmosphere of excitement in the theatre.</P>
        <P>At the end of the play the chief character, Jeffrey Skilling, the accountant who organised the tricky things to inflate the books of Enron to make it a bubble company just like our bubble economy, is in an orange jumpsuit and is obviously in jail where he will spend a lot of time.  One could feel in the audience a massive wave of emotion because the outcome in Ireland, which is a  result of the way we have run this crony capitalism, is unimaginable.  That is the problem.  There is no Madoff or Enron and Jeffrey Skilling moment in Ireland.  The lords of misrule have their houses in Marbella and their little tax boltholes in Switzerland.  They are around the world.  They are in the pricier parts of Connecticut and New England, starting afresh or else they come back for the odd match and so on like our tax exiles.</P><Col N="233"/>
        <P Just="Left">Our tax exiles do not merit a little note in the four year plan.  It is the little people who have to give and who will take it on the chin while the people who lectured us and continue to do so have the luxury of not having to do their share of the heavy lifting.  What is the attitude of the Irish negotiators to the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the IMF?</P>
        <P>I, like many Irish people, had a very strange experience recently, which Deputies can try themselves.  I have been texting people because I have been doing a lot of work in examining the IMF and how its structures work.  When I type &ldquo;IMF&rdquo; into predictive text what word comes first?  The word &ldquo;God.&rdquo;  Of course we have to have a rescue plan.  We need rescuers and helpers but we also need to be emotionally, mentally and intellectually tough in the negotiations.  I look at the sorry set of Ministers, who are mostly feeling sorry for themselves and not the rest of us.  I see real emotion and pain etched on many faces but in many cases it is for themselves.  I wonder about their capacity to negotiate a tough deal on behalf of this country.</P>
        <P>Some people in the Department of Finance, and probably the Minister for Finance, have been hanging out a little bit too long and familiarly with Jean-Claude Trichet.  I have listened to him and others speaking in Dublin.  As a country, of course we have made terrible mistakes but if they think they can make Ireland a poster child for punishment by international finance agencies by destroying this country with terms of negotiation which are impossible to deal with, like the Germans after the Treaty of Versailles they will rue the day and set a bad example for the eurozone.</P>
        <P Just="Left">They need to pause because Ireland will not be able to pay these debts.  I wish to tell the men from the IMF, the ECB and the European Commission that Ireland needs money at cheap rates of interest if it is going to have a chance to pay back, which Irish people wish and are committed to doing, the sort of financial advances which are being made to us.</P>
        <P>We can apologise for having a Government which has dealt so ineptly with the blanket guarantee.  I am sure the IMF is appalled to find that the room for manoeuvre in  regard to the bondholders is probably very limited because of the blanket bank guarantee.  On the statement yesterday on the four year recovery plan, what is the ghost at the feast?  What is the ghost, like Hamlet&rsquo;s father, stalking the perimeters of the plan?  The ghost is the banks and the bank debts which are on our shoulders.  I ask people in the eurozone not to make this a four or five act tragedy.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Act one was Greece, act two is Ireland, act three may be Portugal and, worst of all for the strategists in the eurozone, act four could be Spain.  We need a serious discussion about this.  People in Europe may say: &ldquo;Who is a Member of the Irish Parliament, given the state in which the country is, to even dare to question us?&rdquo;  Solidarity is a founding principle of the European Union and the Union I support and it is a two-way street.  Mrs. Merkel made a very good point in regard to bondholders bearing part of the debts.  She clarified those statements to refer to the time after 2013.  However, what Mrs. Merkel had to say on that is essentially sensible and reasonable in that if a bank collapses not only the shareholders, who in Ireland lost their shirts, but the bondholders, who are risk takers, should share in the losses.</P>

        <P>I heard people here complain that Mrs. Merkel&rsquo;s statement fluttered the bond markets.  The difficulty with the bond markets is that if one says there will be pain for them, they will react by repricing up the interest rates on one&rsquo;s debt.  They are the epitome of market forces &mdash; market forces red in tooth and claw.  Many of those market forces are prepared to take a punt on the destruction of the euro and are probably making an awful lot of money.  They made an awful lot of money on Greece and I am quite sure there are people counting the hundreds of millions of euro they made on Ireland.  They are stalking the eurozone to see where they can strike next.</P><Col N="234"/>
        <P>It is time for the people in charge of the eurozone to think about strategies that not only maintain countries like Ireland, but maintain the eurozone because unless they can do both, the eurozone will have a very problematic future.  Up to the current debacle, the eurozone, on balance, has actually been good for Ireland.</P>
        <P>I refer to the interest rates.  The United Kingdom and the Swedish finance minister mentioned rates of 3%.  The IMF normally lends at rates of approximately 3.2%.  These are the kinds of rates of interest Ireland requires in terms of its debt.  Ireland also needs to spread some of this over a longer period.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has staked a position which is not popular with Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party or the former Progressive Democrat.  I know it is under consideration by Fine Gael.  If one frontloads too much austerity, one gets this momentary approval from the markets around the frontloading of the austerity.  The difficulty is that the frontloading of the austerity, if it is accompanied by penal rates of interest, will sink the country.  If the same is done in other countries in this three or four act tragedy of the peripheral countries, there will be a fifth act which will be the destruction of the euro.  Let us pause to think about what is not only in Ireland&rsquo;s interest, but in the mutual interest of the eurozone and the euro as a currency.</P>
        <P>I move to the contents of the report.  People have spoken to me about one of the suggestions in the report in regard to labour market reforms.  There will be a 10% reduction in pay for new entrants to the public service.  The Government and all the parties in this House should clarify at, or after, the next election that it includes Deputies and the incoming Government.  That is my view which many of my party colleagues share.  It is something about which people must think but one cannot load pain on young people coming into the public service and then say that the people at the top of it are, somehow or other, exempt from it.</P>
        <P>I agree there needs to be measures in the social welfare system which encourage people to get back to work.  One cannot have a system where young people are encouraged to see life on the dole as some kind of permanent position.  When the Labour Party was last in government, I was a Minister of State in the Department of Social Welfare.  We created the back to work scheme and a series of returns to health, education, training and work in the community.  Much of that was done away with during the years of the Celtic tiger.  The feeling among agencies like F&Aacute;S was that the people on the unemployment register were somehow unfit for work.  We must change all of that.</P>
        <P>We have extraordinarily well qualified people on the register, many of whom have fine professional qualifications.  The challenge for us and the smart economy, which is mentioned in the plan, is to think smart about how those people can contribute.  We have suggested graduate internship schemes and various return to work experience schemes.  All those options must be activated.</P>
        <P>We have suggested rents should be reviewable downwards as well as upwards.  There is a hint of that in the plan but it is not spelled out.  The Government has refrained from spelling out the details of the tax and pension changes.</P>
        <P>I was in a debate not so long ago with the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and I talked about property-based tax breaks being capable of producing &euro;800 million in savings over a couple of years.  As he does, the Minister got a bit annoyed and said he had advice from the Attorney General that this was impossible.  I am glad the winding down of tax breaks has finally been acknowledged and included in this document.  That is a bipartisan move on the part of the Government which I welcome.</P><Col N="235"/>
        <P>There must be a new kind of bipartisan politics in which there is robust debate.  Some of the Ministers who have been in government for 13 years must acknowledge that the monopoly on wisdom is not held by Fianna F&aacute;il and that Fianna F&aacute;il must yield to others and acknowledge that our ideas have merit.  After all, we advised Fianna F&aacute;il correctly on the bank guarantee.  For its own reasons, it did not accept that advice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People in Ireland can be very robust in their opposition to any or all of the measures.  That is a democratic right.  However, I plead with people not to be photo fodder for some of the international media stalking Dublin and various buildings.  Ireland is not just ghost estates and piebald ponies left to run in fields, even though those images are appealing.  In Greece, the impact of the violence that occurred has been to really damage its tourism trade.  Tourism is a really important earner in this country and it will help it to recover.  I appeal to people in some of the smaller political organisations &mdash; I know some people are mad as hell and do not want to take anymore &mdash; not to be used as photo fodder presenting the worst imagine of Ireland.</P>
        <P>There are good things about Ireland.  We are in a difficult place but we have great people and we will recover.  Our Administration is acting like the Hoover administration in the Great Depression.  We need a Rooseveltian administration which will produce a New Deal for this country and will help it to recover.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address this four year plan from a Government which has, at best, two months to run.  It is wrongly entitled the national recovery plan.  The national destruction plan would be a considerably more appropriate name, given that it is coming from a Government which is badly broken and split, and which has no credibility either internationally or here on this island.  The sooner an election comes to deal with the matter, the better.</P>
        <P>There are two aspects to this plan with which I have considerable problems.  It is littered with regressive measures that will deflate the economy and there is no stimulus in it.  It is all about deflation rather than the required stimulus.  I will return to that point.  A second concern is that it does not deal with the banking bailout cost.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, told us at the beginning of this crisis two years ago that the banking bailout would not cost the taxpayer a red cent, and if it required some front-loading of charges, the banks would be levied and the overall cost would be zero.  How naive is that, and how can the Government not even address the issue of the bailout, with the significant cost to the taxpayers of this State?  It does not concern just one generation but several, yet the matter is not addressed.</P>
        <P>We can consider the Government&rsquo;s banking strategy.  Representatives from the IMF, the ECB and the European Commission are in town and I am due to meet them immediately after this contribution.  They are negotiating with the Government, which still does not know the cost of the bailout two years on.  It is important to point out that in those years the Government has focused almost entirely on the banking sector and has not produced any significant stimulus package to create or retain jobs.  This is all about the banks, yet two years on there is still no idea of the cost of the banking bailout.</P>
        <P>It was telling that yesterday during Leaders&rsquo; Questions when Deputy Enda Kenny queried the cost, the Taoiseach was hesitant.  Deputy Kenny mentioned the figure of &euro;85 billion that has been mooted for some time and asked if the final figure would be greater.  The Taoiseach replied that the figure could be close to that figure and he did not think it would go into triple figures; he mentioned that we are looking at double figures.  The &euro;85 billion consists of 11 figures, not double figures.  Is it any wonder that we are where we are under this Government when it is so casual about these matters?</P><Col N="236"/>
        <P>It is ironic that a Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was cautioning us in his contribution to these statements.  He indicated that we must be very careful with figures and should not throw them around.  The Government should provide the figures if that is the case, as I believe the cost of the bailout will be well in excess of &euro;85 billion.  It will be closer to &euro;120 billion or &euro;140 billion.  I hope it can be contained.</P>
        <P>The Government is not good with figures as it thought the deficit was in the order of &euro;7 billion but we now know it is &euro;15 billion.  In September the Government thought the required adjustment for this year would be &euro;3 billion but it is now &euro;6 billion.  Imagine a member of that Government cautioning the Opposition and Members of the House to be careful with figures when that is being thrown around.</P>
        <P>The IMF is probably serious about trying to get to grips with how much this bailout will cost.  Its representatives have gone to the banks and may have had to push out some of those hanging on from the bad days who created this mess in the first place.  Almost half the boards of the banks and executives who led the banks through this crisis, who brought us deep into the mire with the Government looking the other way or encouraging them in some cases, are still in place.  That is completely unacceptable.  There is now the prospect of the IMF trying to establish the exact figures and proposing the course of action to be followed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I mentioned the board members and directors of the banks.  More than two years later not one of these is in prison or has even been brought before the courts.  I wonder why this is so.  Who is blocking the justice system and what roadblocks are in place preventing some kind of inquiry?  The Garda investigation has been ongoing for some time so what is preventing it from coming to a conclusion with people being charged and hauled before the courts, as happens in any other walk of life?  The golden circle seems to be exempt even from the justice process of the State, which is shocking.</P>
        <P>We are discussing how much the bailout will cost but whatever it is it will be too much.  We cannot afford the bailout as we do not have the industrial and economic base in this small State or across this island for it.  A conclusion must be reached sooner rather than later, although how can it be sooner, given that two years have elapsed?  There will either be a negotiation or a burning of bondholders.  There may be a debt for equity swap.  Something must be done because this State, even with the significant bailout from the IMF and ECB, cannot afford the process.  A large part of our financial difficulties come from it.</P>
        <P>In his opening contribution to this debate the Taoiseach cautioned us that the problem will require focused attention on the economic crisis.  It needs somebody to figure out the problem and deal with it, which the Government has not done.  We have had no leadership from the Government at all in the banking crisis, so what good is that focused attention?  Ireland&rsquo;s banks are bust and we should decouple them from sovereign debt.  We must deal with them in the way I outlined by dealing with the bondholders and finishing with the issue once and for all.</P>
        <P>The bailout will not reduce the amount we owe by even one euro and we will still have to pay a crippling debt in return for the bailout from the ECB and IMF.  That will see Ireland accept more debt, primarily because the interest rate, as speculated on currently, is in the order of 5%.  We have no idea if the figure is right as it comes from speculation.  The 5% figure can be compared to the figure just above 1% that we got from the ECB recently, which shows our position in real terms.  The Government has indicated that as recent developments in the international bond markets have shown, persisting with the current scale of borrowing will result in interest rates remaining at unaffordable levels.  We know that and sovereign bond markets are punishing Ireland while the current policy of protecting all bank bondholders remains in place.  That will continue until the Government gets real on the issue.</P><Col N="237"/>
        <P>The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, is present in the Chamber.  I regard him as a person conscientious about his work and position in the Government.  I hope somebody in the Cabinet will bring this message to the debate and look for the Government to wise up.  I know the Government is being driven by the European Commission on saving these bondholders but it should look to what is right for the Irish people.  The Government should remember them in some of these negotiations.</P>
        <P>With regard to the regressive measures mooted in this plan, the Government has always said it will do what is fair and equitable, protect the vulnerable and go after those who can afford it.  Let us have a look at that statement.  I do not believe the reduction in the minimum wage is fair and equitable.  As Deputy Noonan indicated, most of those earning the minimum wage are students or women in menial, tough jobs.  Rather than giving poor devils who work hard a payment of &euro;8.65 per hour, the pay of those on the minimum wage will be reduced.  They also face a double whammy because they will be drawn into the tax net under the Government&rsquo;s taxation proposals.  Instead of dealing with wealthy bondholders &mdash; the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, identified them earlier, although we knew already that they are large pension funds and insurance companies &mdash; the Government is going after those on the minimum wage by reducing their pay and hammering them for a second time through the tax code.</P>
        <P>The document does not give any indication that the Government proposes to go after those earning big bucks such as the chief executives of semi-State companies who have salaries of more than &euro;500,000 per annum.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate the reason for this oversight.  Will individual Cabinet Ministers indicate whether they contributed to the debate at Cabinet level on whether to protect those on the minimum wage or allow the extremely wealthy to continue to enjoy huge salaries?  We will be told the Government went after the latter group when it reduced salaries by 7% and by a further amount thereafter.  That is nonsense because those at the top of the pile are getting off virtually scot-free.  It is grossly unfair that those at the bottom of the rung are hammered on every occasion.  The Government is looking in the wrong place by focusing on marginalised people who can least afford cuts rather than those who can afford them.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s plan proposes to reduce the threshold at which income tax is paid to bring people on the minimum wage into the tax net.  The document does not propose to go after people who are earning in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum, as proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in in the pre-budget submission it made to the Government some weeks ago.  We proposed the introduction of a new tax rate of 48% for those earning in excess of &euro;100,000.  Did the Minister or any of his colleagues read the Sinn F&eacute;in document which I sent to the Minister for Finance?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>We looked at it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister will respond to the contents of our submission because I would like to debate it with a Minister, either in the House or elsewhere.  The sooner we do so, the better.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s agenda of going after low income families is grossly unfair.  The proposal to increase the VAT rate from 21% to 23% is another regressive measure.  I warmly welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s decision to reduce VAT by 0.5% in last year&rsquo;s budget.  The measure had an immediate effect in reducing the number of shoppers crossing the Border into towns such as Newry, Enniskillen and Derry.  The effect was almost instantaneous and helped businesses in Border towns which had been badly affected by the previous increase in the VAT rate.  An increase in VAT will have a significant effect.  It will result in larger car parks being built in Newry, Enniskillen and Derry, while shopping centres in those towns will be extended to cope <Col N="238"/>with the influx of shoppers from this State.  Businesses in the South within a large radius of Border will close their doors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">VAT is a regressive tax because lower income families pay a substantially larger part of their income in VAT on ordinary household goods than well-off families.  The proposal to increase VAT is grossly unfair and completely wrong.</P>
        <P>The Government proposes to reduce public service numbers by 24,750.  While I fully support reform of the public sector, it should not be dragged out over six or seven years.  We do not need more reports which will lie on a shelf for years.  Public service reform should be led by a Minister who is up for the job and will act quickly to ensure efficiency in the public sector.  If this involves job losses, so be it, because we need an efficient and effective public sector that will deliver the services people in this State deserve.  To take an axe to the public service, as proposed in the plan, will probably result in the most competent public servants leaving the sector or retiring.  A more efficient process should be introduced to ensure the public service does what it should do.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to increase the student service charge from &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,000 per annum.  This is despite everything we hear about the smart economy.  The Green Party informed Deputies earlier that it had been successful in protecting education.  However, as my colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, addressed this issue at length, I do not propose to be repetitious.</P>
        <P>An average growth rate of 2.75% has been projected for the four year period.  Some of this growth is based on current export levels.  I believe the export figures are being distorted by several percentage points as a result of the vast amount of plant and equipment leaving the State, mainly destined for Poland.  I do not know if this trend, which has been particularly acute in the past 12 months, has been factored into the export figures as a dividend for the State.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is a short-lived phenomenon and we will shortly experience its repercussions.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in offered a different approach from that of the Government.  We proposed to levy additional tax on those with individual incomes of more than &euro;100,000 per annum, cap public service pay at &euro;100,000 and introduce substantial pay cuts for Ministers, Deputies and Senators.  Were our proposals considered?  None of them has been included in the four year plan, which suggests the Government does not like my party&rsquo;s approach.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in also proposed substantial debt reduction measures amounting to &euro;4.67 billion and a stimulus package in excess of &euro;2.5 billion to promote job creation.  Any amount of evidence is available that the system has capacity for jobs growth.  For instance, the agrifood sector, to which several speakers referred, has major potential for jobs growth and export development.  Despite this, the Government has not given any signs that it will take significant measures in the sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s tax raising proposals focus on those who can afford to pay as opposed to those on the minimum wage.  The Minister for Finance informed the House that the reductions in expenditure are &ldquo;focused on the areas of greatest cost&rdquo;, which he proceeded to list as public sector pay and pensions, social welfare and programmes such as the public capital programme.  Rather than approach expenditure reductions on the basis of identifying who can afford to pay, by his own admission the man in charge, the Minister for Finance, attacked the high-cost areas.  We know the reason the Minister faced in the completely wrong direction when he sought cuts.</P>
        <P>I took the opportunity to find out how Greece was managing its memorandum of understanding, in other words, the terms and conditions of the bailout it was provided.  Among the impositions made by the EU-IMF were an increase in VAT rates, an increase in excise on fuel, tobacco and alcohol &mdash; I suppose we could live with that one&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="239"/>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;a reduction of &euro;500 million in public investment, a broadening of the VAT base by including services currently exempted from VAT and moving a significant proportion &mdash; at least 30% &mdash; of the goods and services currently subject to the reduced rate onto the normal rate.</P>
        <P>Again, this is a highly regressive approach.  I am due to meet these IMF people within the next two minutes but so much for the memorandum of understanding that was used in Greece.  This provides some idea of what we are dealing with in respect of the IMF and the ECB.  However, I do not expect the Government to approach this in a constructive way on behalf of the Irish taxpayer or Irish society because its record is all wrong.  The record of the Government is atrocious and the sooner there is a general election the better, to enable the people of this State to get some kind of relief from the vagaries, to put it at its mildest, of the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the difficulties with the banks started, some of the political parties in this country have resorted to constant sloganising, rather than analysing the issues.  In fairness to my colleagues on the benches directly opposite, they accepted that the collapse of the banking system, the closing down of the ATMs and the inability of people to gain access to their deposits would have been an unthinkable catastrophe.  Unfortunately, the Labour Party did not agree with that approach and believed there was a magic solution that would keep the ATMs going and people&rsquo;s deposits safe while at the same time allowing banks to close.  Such a proposition is both implausible and impossible.  At the time of the guarantee, there were &euro;51 billion in deposits in Anglo Irish Bank, of which &euro;21 billion were of Irish origin.  Does the Labour Party really suggest it believes it would have been of no consequence to this economy or that it would not have caused great disruption to people and their savings, had that &euro;21 billion been lost?  I hope the Labour Party would not be so cavalier with people&rsquo;s money.</P>
        <P>Moreover, that money was made up in many ways.  Charitable organisations had deposits in Anglo Irish Bank, as had many commercial organisations that are providing employment.  I <Col N="240"/>believe many credit unions had deposits in that bank, as there also were interbank deposits.  In other words, what the Labour Party has never been willing to admit is that if one allowed the collapse of a bank, the contagion throughout the system could bring down the entire banking system.  Therefore, at the time the Government guaranteed the banks, the option was either to put in a wholesale guarantee to protect the system or to face the terrible consequence that everything one takes for granted every day would longer exist.  The ability to withdraw one&rsquo;s own deposits, to get money from the ATM machines or to make payments by writing cheques no longer would exist.</P>
        <P>However, the amazing thing about the Labour Party is that it then put forward a proposition that the Government should actually pay the shareholders to nationalise the banks.  The Labour Party wanted the Government to give money to the shareholders of AIB and the Bank of Ireland.  That would have cost &euro;4 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money to bail out shareholders, had the Government followed the Labour Party&rsquo;s mantra.  The banks will be in State ownership, more or less, but the Government will not have paid a single euro to bank shareholders for those banks, contrary to what the Labour Party wanted to do.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>When that happens, the Labour Party will be obliged to state what it intends to do.  If, as the Deputy expects, it wins the election, whenever it is held, it will be obliged to make the hard decisions it has avoided articulating over the last few years.  The Labour Party no longer will be able to use a set of accountancy figures that simply do not stack up in any real sense of mathematics that I ever was taught.  These are the hard facts that will face the Labour Party.  At least Fine Gael has shown some realism, although I do not agree with all its policies, but the Labour Party is living in absolute fantasy land.  It tries to persuade people that there are a lot of easy answers that simply do not exist in any real world.</P>
        <P>A second point that it is important for the two Opposition parties to clarify is whether they propose that existing senior tier 1 bondholders in banks are not to be paid back the money.  I believe that had the Government followed that path, bad and all as our problems now are, they would have been much more serious than they are today.  It is about time the Opposition made it clear exactly what is its policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has made it clear that for legal and practical reasons, to fail to honour Tier 1 bonds is not the way to go forward.  I believe that is the right policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Arthur Morgan obviously has not read the plan.  He obviously did not read the sections that deal with tax relief and pension contributions.  In fact, there is a radical change in the way tax relief will be available on pension schemes.  It will ensure that rich people will not be able to shelter large sums of money in pension relief.  I quote a sentence from the plan: &ldquo;Pension tax expenditures will be kept under constant review to ensure that abuse of tax sheltering does not take place.&rdquo;  That is right.  I have always believed that pension funds should not be a place where the very rich can hide their money and avoid taxation.  </P>
        <P>We are also reducing the annual earnings cap for personal contributions by almost 25%, to &euro;115,000 per year, and introducing a lifetime cap on pension contributions.  This is very significant and important because it will make those who can pay do so, including those with very large incomes that they could put into a tax shelter.</P>
        <P>Some parties make great play of increasing the top rate of tax.  One might get another 4% or 5% there but one might not.  If the top rate is too low one raises no money and if it is too high it might be a disincentive, which would not be in the long-term interest of the development of the economy.  It is much more advantageous to get rid of tax breaks.  Tax breaks to be finished in the budget include those for patent royalties; investment in machinery and plant for exploration; approved share options and; benefits in kind.  We are totally closing down many tax shelters.  Increased revenue in those cases will be 41%.  We have also made it clear that we will be charging PRSI and the health levy on pension contributions.  The plan is radical in tackling the issue of those at the top paying a fair and equitable amount of tax, particularly those whose incomes are so large that they could avail of various tax shelters and tax avoidance measures that have been there in the past.  That is an important part of the plan.</P>
        <P>When one goes through departmental Estimates, as every Deputy does in some committee of the House, one often finds it is not so easy to make saving.  I am always fascinated when I <Col N="244"/>debate the Estimates for my Department in a select committee.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd and I have done so often.  I cannot remember Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd ever pointing out where I could save &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Most of the time he was telling me that expenditure was not half enough and that I should be spending more on the various schemes.</P>

	<P>When one breaks down Government expenditure, one third is related to wages.  That is comprehensively dealt with in the plan, including pensions for retired public servants.</P>
        <P>Some 38% of current expenditure relates to the Department of Social Protection, which is my Department.  My Department must have a huge focus on the old, the unemployed and the invalid.  Therefore, we must look at how we can reduce expenditure while minimising the impact on ordinary people.</P>

        <P>People often ask where all the revenue from the Celtic tiger building boom went?  Much of it went on improving the social welfare system.  For example, expenditure in 2000 was &euro;6.7 billion and expenditure in 2010 will be &euro;20.9 billion.  Some people, who do not do the sums, will argue that this is caused by the increase in unemployment.  However, the total payment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is approximately &euro;4.5 billion, and there are always people in receipt of unemployment payments, full-time or part-time.  Unemployment payments clearly account for a very small fraction of total expenditure.  The rest of the increase went on improvements in schemes and a huge increase in the rates of social welfare payments.  For example, we increased the average rate of payment for schemes by approximately 130% at a time of 40% inflation.  There were real gains for people receiving payments from my Department.  In ten years, we multiplied expenditure on carers by six, at a time of 30% inflation.  How did we do that?  We introduced a half-way carer&rsquo;s allowance, which is much prized by, for example, pensioners who are caring for other people.  We also introduced the respite allowance.  We increased income disregards for the means test and we increased rates.  We used a lot of money during the Celtic tiger years to improve the lot of carers.  The challenge in my Department is to hold onto as much of that architecture as we can in the middle of a world downturn.  That is what we will seek to do.</P>
        <P>As I indicated yesterday and as is indicated in the plan, there will, of course, be cuts in rates this year.  We will also be seeking to match those with other savings that will not impact on the provision of services.</P><Col N="245"/>
        <P>It is also our intention to cap the payment to RTE and CIE in relation to the free television licence and free travel, but that will not impinge on the existing or future rights of people to free travel or the free television licence.  It is our belief that the sum we pay on behalf of people entitled to free television is more than adequate for the service being provided by the public service broadcaster.</P>
        <P>How will we deal with the reduction of &euro;3 billion in the spend of my Department, which will still be by far the biggest spending Department in Government, over the next four years?  I take exception to the statement issued by Social Justice Ireland yesterday.  It tried, totally contrary to what is said in the plan, to indicate that savings would be made solely by rate cuts.  Rate cuts are the least attractive option.  They will be the option of last resort and every effort will be made in 2012, 2013 and 2014, to ensure that rate cuts will not be a major contributor to savings.</P>
        <P>How will we make these savings?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We will make savings by a number of methods.  First, we will introduce greatly enhanced control measures.  I know &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; came up with the ridiculous figure of &euro;2 billion that could be made in that way.  I wish it were true but I do not believe it is.  However, there is money to be saved by extra control measures.  For example, we will be introducing the public services card next year.  Other developments have taken place in the last year, some of which are subject to the enactment of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is before the D&aacute;il at present and some of which are subject to the Bill that came before the D&aacute;il earlier this year.  They will give us savings in control measures.  A more modest saving than suggested by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; would be possible.  The Opposition tell me &euro;200 million is a small figure.  If that amount could be saved by my Department it would be a significant contribution to the &euro;600 million that must be saved in 2012.</P>
        <P>The second method of saving will be to reduce unemployment.  That is very important and it is why so much of the plan has to do with competitiveness. The figures are simple.  Everyone who no longer claims jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit saves the Department an average of &euro;12,000 per year in direct expenditure.  If 10,000 people were removed from the live register, there would be a saving of &euro;120 million.  A reduction of 20,000 on the live register would yield a saving of &euro;240 million.  If one added to this the PRSI and tax that would be paid, the figure would increase to &euro;400 million, as I am told constantly by the Opposition.  Therefore, when one considers the figure of &euro;600 million, one will see there is another way.</P>
        <P>The third point concerns a much more aggressive national employment action programme.  A national employment action programme will be beefed up next year.  Many more people will be called for interviews and we will increase the number of places on a number of schemes.  I will implement the provisions of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010. <Col N="246"/> Therefore, those who do not interact with the national employment action plan, either in terms of obtaining a job or training, will be subject to the penalties listed in the Bill, which will allow us to reduce the rate received by those who do not turn up for interview.</P>
        <P>Statistics recently provided to me by my Department show that 8% of people called under the national employment action programme did not attend for interview and continued to claim payments.  That is intolerable.  If one who is unemployed and actively seeking work is invited to an interview to try to help one get a job, the least one should do is turn up.  We must stop codding ourselves in this regard and must not tolerate circumstances in which no sanction is taken against those who fail to turn up.  In fairness to Fine Gael, it supports my approach.  It is only if all these actions do not result in the required saving that rate reductions should become a reality.</P>
        <P>I mentioned a figure of &euro;600 million for the budget of 2012.  It is clear that significant savings can be made by being proactive.  I intend being proactive on these issues for as long as I am in the Department.  If one saved &euro;500 million of the &euro;600 million, the rate reduction one would need to make up the balance would be in the order &euro;1.10.  Therefore, there is a massive onus on us to ensure that we stop paying social welfare payments to those who are not entitled to them.  We must send a message out collectively that cheating social welfare now is putting one&rsquo;s hand in the pocket of the old, disabled and unemployed.  This can no longer be tolerated in our society.  The old approach of nodding and winking in respect of people signing on and of people with very respectable backgrounds paying such people in the knowledge that they are signing on, must now come to an end.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important debate.  Unfortunately, it comprises statements rather than a motion.  I would like to use this democratically elected House to send a message to the European Commission.  I spent three years as a Member of the European Parliament, three of my most rewarding years in public life.  If there was one word I understood at the end of those three years, it was the &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo;.  It is not a word that I understood when I first became a Member of the European Parliament or that I really embraced when growing up.  However, it resonated for me every week in debates in the European Parliament, many of which debates were emotive.  I was a Member at a time when new member states joined the Union and when French and German MEPs were marking the end of the Second World War and the setting up of the European Union.</P>
        <P>I remind Commissioner Rehn and others, for whom I have a lot of time, that Ireland now needs solidarity.  We have not asked for it before.  Ireland will never need solidarity in terms of military protection but it has a self-created catastrophe based on the debt it will have to incur <Col N="247"/>in the coming years.  We require understanding and solidarity from our European partners.  The idea that Ireland would have to pay interest of between 6% and 7% on funds drawn from an emergency stability fund, contributed to primarily by EU member states, is totally inconsistent with the principles of the European Union, to which I am absolutely committed, and with everything I learned as a young MEP in the European Parliament.  I remind the EU delegation in Ireland that this is not about teaching Ireland a lesson or sending out a signal to other countries in the Union that if they must access emergency funds, it will cost them.  It should be a question of member states who can afford to do so helping out a small country that has made a mess of its finances and governance because of irresponsible banking and irresponsible political behaviour in government.</P>
        <P>Ireland needs a solidarity fund.  Unfortunately, we have had to compromise our sovereignty and independent decision-making in order to access that fund.  We need a fund that we can draw on while incurring little or no interest, perhaps with increasing interest rates over time, after which we will have been given time to breathe and rebuild our economy, as we have the capacity to do.  In the short term, however, we will not have the capacity to grow as a country and economy and build the kind of lifestyle we need to build here and elsewhere in Europe if we strangle the people with interest rates such that we will be spending 20% to 30% of taxation revenue repaying interest on loans we are now negotiating with EU member states.  Whatever about the IMF, I want to send that message to the European Commission.  The message is from a member state that has been loyal and committed to the European project from the very outset and which has worked hard to achieve certain outcomes in referenda when it was difficult to do so.</P>
        <P>We are debating a national recovery plan.  Young people were present in the Visitors Gallery for the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  Does he believe they are leaving the House inspired in the belief that they will be more likely to get a job in two years than now?  Does he believe their parents will be inspired to believe that this country, although everybody, apart from totally unrealistic people in the House, accepts we need to take pain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The belief the Irish need right now from the Government will come from a commitment to reform, proceeding differently, leading by example, and changing the political system before asking people to change their households.  There is nothing about this in the four year plan.</P>
     
        <P>Fine Gael has made a commitment to reduce the number of national public representatives by 35%.  We are going to change the way this House operates and the way in which decisions are made.  We are going to put in place an independent fiscal council which will give to Opposition parties resources similar to those available to Government parties.  We will not keep people in the shade in the way those currently in government have done during the two years of this crisis.</P>

	<P>The only stimulus of any note in this plan relates to capital expenditure programmes.  Unfortunately, the deal the Government is currently negotiating with the IMF and with the EU institutions completely undermines the credibility of the national recovery plan.  The plan states that in the next four years the ESB, a semi-State company, is going to spend &euro;6 billion on infrastructure projects throughout the country.  However, the ESB and every other State company and asset is going to be used as collateral or security for the loan in respect of which the Government is negotiating.  We do not, therefore, have the capacity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us get matters straight.  The Joint Committee on Education and Skills wrote to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills inviting her to come before <Col N="249"/>it in order to discuss the headings under which the current Administration is preparing the budget for the coming year.  The T&aacute;naiste refused that invitation.  The Government refuses to be accountable to the D&aacute;il for what is happening at present and for what took place in the past.</P>
        <P>The key point I wish to make is that our sovereignty is gone because any view we might have must be referred to Brussels.  Perhaps we have reached the stage where the Government will rename &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in &ldquo;&Aacute;ras Rehn&rdquo; because it is clear that the power relating to the governance of this State lies elsewhere.  Consent and agreement must now be obtained from the European Commission in respect of any proposals of a financial nature which we wish to put forward.  That is the sorry pass to which the country has come.</P>
        <P>We have been reduced to a terrible state.  Under the current Government, there is no hope.  It has put before us a plan for the next four years which it will never be allowed to implement because the wrath of the people will be visited upon it in the forthcoming general election.  The Government is setting in stone certain things which we do not accept.  As Deputy Kenny stated last night, one of the key attacks it is making is on the poorest and most vulnerable in our society, namely, the lowest paid.  Those who earn least will suffer disproportionately under the proposals contained in this plan.  That will have to be changed.  A new Government will be obliged to put in place a plan for the nation.  It will not be the current Administration which will be doing this.  That is why a general election must be held as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The plan does not contain any of the reforms that are required in respect of the public sector.  Such reforms could be easily insisted upon by any or all Ministers.  In the area of education, there has been a disgraceful situation whereby those at the top levels in universities have been paying themselves moneys to which they were never legally entitled.  For example, three presidents of the University of Limerick, concurrently and over a period of three years, drew down the full salary relating to the position of president.  A former president of University College Galway was obliged to repay more than &euro;250,000.  In addition, staff at UCD were paid in excess of &euro;1 million to which they were not entitled.  In circumstances where people at the top are being paid money to which they are not entitled &mdash; even under law &mdash; and where the poorest and most disadvantaged are being screwed to the wall, it is obvious that there are grave inequalities in our society.</P>
        <P>When I was a member of the Joint Committee on Transport, we tried to examine the position regarding bonuses in the public sector, particularly those paid out by the harbour authorities.  We challenged the latter to outline the bonuses that were being paid and representatives from one of the authorities stated that we had no right to request such information.  Bonuses are being paid to people in the public sector about which we do not know and about which the relevant individuals will not provide information.  Harbour authorities are unaccountable and will not provide details in respect of their budgetary affairs to properly constituted Oireachtas committees.  Some in the universities are running riot while seeking to look after themselves and now the Government is proposing to tax the very people who require to be retrained.  More than 40,000 students are currently attending plc colleges and the Government is proposing to impose a tax on entry of &euro;200 per head on those who, having lost their jobs, are seeking to enter these institutions in order to try to improve their job prospects.  Neither adequate nor proper consideration has been given to what is being proposed.</P>
        <P>The Government proposes to tax people on the lowest rung in society who are paid the least.  In that context, I wish to read into the record a letter I received from a constituent.  All Deputies receive letters of this nature, but the one which was sent to me is exceptional.  It was written by a man who is in his nineties and whose wife is also in her nineties.  The letter states:</P><Col N="250"/>
        <P LI="1" el="5">When I pay the State and the home [which his wife is in] I have nothing left at the end of each month.  I live on my own, partly disabled, with the prospects of continued misery.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As already stated, the letter from which I am quoting was written by a man in his nineties who is in a state of despair regarding the way he is being treated and the way in which his wife is being treated in the nursing home in which she resides.  There is no doubt that these people are being treated in a shameful and disgraceful manner.  I accept that the Government put the fair deal scheme in place.  However, the man and woman to whom I refer are being obliged to pay additional charges in respect of occasional concerts, baking demonstrations, flower arranging and mass.  These people are being charged for things to which they should be automatically entitled or of which they will never be in a position to avail.</P>
        <P>That which I have outlined is happening because the Government has allowed those who operate nursing homes, employees of State bodies and the chief executive officers of organisations such as Coillte to pay themselves enormous sums &mdash; in some cases up to &euro;500,000 per year.  The head of the Dublin Airport Authority is paid &euro;750,000 per year.  Despite this, the Government expects ordinary people to take it in the neck.  That will not happen.  The Government will be rejected by the electorate and will never be in a position to implement the national recovery plan, which is fundamentally wrong in respect of certain core issues.</P>

	<P>Before I entered the Chamber, I received an e-mail from Baghdad which states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">All moving along here and with a government starting to form here, business and investment will get back on track once the new government is announced.  I have been watching the goings on at home and the way things seem to be coming out.  We have not improved our reputation with the way the Government has handled the whole affair.  I am asked daily by colleagues here about how this could have happened.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As already stated, this message was sent from Baghdad, which is located in one of the most unsettled regions in the world.  Those in that city are looking forward to a new government while we have chaos here.  The person who sent the e-mail proceeds to state, &ldquo;If I had to describe it, I would describe it as reckless banking, no regulation and failure of Government, who were totally complacent and indifferent.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>When I think of Baghdad, I am reminded of Chemical Ali who, when American forces were approaching that city, appeared on live television and stated that there was no problem and that the Americans had been surrounded and destroyed.  The position with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance is somewhat similar.  For a long period they made public statements to the effect that there was no problem here, that matters were under control and that there were no difficulties with the banks or the economy.  The American invasion of Baghdad provides a good analogy for what happened in respect of our crumbling economy.</P>
        <P>On this recovery plan which, ironically, this Government will not be implementing, there are a few matters I want to mention briefly. As regards tourism &mdash; my area of responsibility &mdash; I thought there would  be some mention of the travel tax, which has been a disaster for tourism.  Tourist numbers will be down by 1 million this year and we will lose &euro;1 billion in revenue.  The travel tax was supposed to yield &euro;120 million but it will yield only &euro;80 million.  Whereas Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary might say much that suits himself, I agree with him in this regard.  People are influenced by that cost when booking tickets. The travel tax has been a major stumbling block <Col N="251"/>for Irish tourism.  In Holland, they were getting more than &euro;300 million from a travel tax, they abolished it and they reckon they have gained &euro;1 billion, in other words, a net gain of &euro;700 million.  This tax is daft and should be removed immediately.  We could make it a condition that both Aer Lingus and Ryanair will bring in the passengers, something to which Mr. O&rsquo;Leary has given a commitment.  He has stated he will bring in 5 million to 6 million extra passengers over a short period of time and create up to 6,000 jobs.</P>

        <P>The plan does not mention that hotels and restaurants all over the country are under considerable pressure from costs and charges.  In the good times of the Celtic tiger I argued here with a previous Minister for tourism, my county colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, that excise duty and every other cost was higher in Ireland than all over Europe.  We lost our competitiveness, and that is another reason people are not coming here.</P>
        <P>One issue about which we could do something is that of rates.  The Valuation Act 2001 envisaged that every rateable property would have its valuation revised every five to ten years.  The Commissioner of Valuation has carried out revisions in only three of the 88 rating areas in the country and where he has carried them out, the rates have been reduced on average by 30%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On another matter, page 96 of the plan refers to the income tax exemption on patent royalties.  This will have a detrimental effect on enterprise.  If the tax relief measures relate to the removal of the income tax exemption on patent royalties, it certainly will cost this country.  This provision has been a significant driver of innovation and growth within many Irish companies and for inventors resident in Ireland.  If a company develops the product and gains patent royalties as a result of the sale of a product, it means the inventors can receive a share of that royalty tax free.  The company must develop the product which results in the employment of high-skilled individuals and each of these individuals must pay income tax on his or her salary.  The innovation must be of such significance that it is patentable and significant costs are incurred in the patenting process.  The benefit of patenting the invention is to protect it from being copied and to ensure the economic benefit goes to the inventing company and, therefore, to the Irish economy.</P>

	<P>I am glad to be able to contribute to this debate, not to be giving the official reply or wind-up but to be able to give some of my own thoughts on the subject.</P>
        <P>I was present for the first two hours of a debate in the Seanad which adopted a reasoned and constructive tone on all sides of the House whereas some of what I have heard here has been very much the cockpit of politics.  That is one of the reasons the Seanad should be maintained, contrary to the position of the main Opposition party.</P>
        <P>As the question of responsibility for the situation constantly arises, I want to give two short quotations from the international newspapers of the past couple of days.  For those who think the Government is to blame, Mr. Martin Wolf, in the <i>Financial Times</i>, pointed out yesterday, &ldquo;It was not the public but the private sector that went haywire in Ireland and in Spain.&rdquo;  Of course, it is when that private borrowing, and the basis of it, collapsed that the gulf in revenues arose.</P>
        <P>The <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, on 23 November, reported:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Ireland&rsquo;s plight is not the result of collecting too little tax.  The country is a victim of the global credit bubble, which tended to hit hardest the countries that had the largest and most innovative financial industries: Ireland, the U.K., Spain, the U.S. and, in its especially perverse way, Iceland.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Government accepts its responsibility in the sense that we believed &mdash; it was the belief of nearly everybody and it was the advice &mdash; that there would be a soft landing.  We were wrong, but so was nearly everyone else.</P>
        <P>We had a vision in this country, which was shared far beyond the ranks of my party, of a dynamic economy with low tax rates but flowing revenues because of its dynamism, and with good social services and infrastructure.  Unfortunately, it was not sustainable.  The favourite mantras of the Labour Party a few years ago were that the country is awash with money and Ireland was the second richest country in the EU, although that was only statistically the case, and the implication was that we should be spending much more money.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the courage of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in the way they have battled against enormous difficulties in the past two and a half years.  One can say the situation was partly of our making but it was also triggered by an international crisis.</P>
        <P>I have some sympathy with a letter that appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning from Ms Irene Houlihan in Birr, which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The constant pillorying of this country&rsquo;s Taoiseach by a frenzied media whipping up anti-Government mob hysteria is shameful and reprehensible.  The words keep coming to mind &mdash; and still the crowd shouted &ldquo;Crucify him!  Crucify him!&rdquo;  Was it for this indeed?</P>
        <P FLI="0">Certainly, as a survey recently showed, we have the freest media in the world which is something of which we should be proud, although I doubt if there is a State broadcasting station anywhere in the world that would allow itself some of the liberties that certain broadcasters permit themselves.</P><Col N="253"/>
        <P>There are certainly some columnists and broadcasters whose coverage can be summed up as &ldquo;aux barricades, citoyens&rdquo;.  I was in Brussels at the end of the first day of a Council of Ministers meeting when I saw the leading voice of <i>The Irish Times </i>scarcely able to contain a grin at the thought, as it looked then, that a dissolution might be about to take place.  At the same time, it is not fair to criticise the media if one is not also prepared to engage in self-criticism and I regret that I have a colleague in Tipperary South to whom is attributed in a headline the phrase &ldquo;worse than Cromwell&rdquo;, which he applied to the Taoiseach and his predecessor.  I hope on reflection that imputation will be withdrawn.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to repeat a very good point made yesterday by a Fine Gael Senator in the Seanad.  One of the principal merits of the plan is that providing a future outline of how we can reach a target of less than 3% of GDP will create confidence.  Of course detailed provisions can be changed or substituted by the next government.  If the Government was remaining in office it would probably have to change and substitute some details itself.  However, the broad thrust is there and I believe the next government will broadly adopt it as an outline.  Given the circumstances of the assistance that is required from the EU and the IMF, it will need to do so but, as I say, this is subject to the caveat that alternatives can be substituted.</P>
        <P>It needs to be understood by the public that with a gap of &euro;18.5 billion, it is not open to us to continue borrowing except on the basis of a plan such as this.  We need to be able to borrow if we are to pay out all of the cheques which a government pays out, including to social welfare recipients, public servants and contractors.</P>
        <P>Much play has been made of the question of sovereignty.  I would like to make the point, and it has been made by several commentators already, that this is our own plan which was prepared largely before we entered into discussions with the IMF and the EU.  This is not an IMF or EU diktat, although I think there are one or two sectors of opinion who wish it were.  Certain columnists associated with a particular Sunday newspaper seem to be raging that the IMF and EU have not insisted on tearing up the Croke Park deal and social partnership with it.</P>
        <P>I see the reduction of the minimum wage not in a negative, but in a positive light.  The extent that it makes more jobs available is of benefit to people and not a detriment to them.  I know it is particularly important to the hotel and hospitality industries.  It is by no means the case that it is always the poorest people on the minimum wage.  Many students taking part-time employment are on the minimum wage to supplement their income.  If all other wages and incomes in the economy have been reduced, it is logical that the minimum wage, which was the second highest in Europe, be adjusted also.</P><Col N="254"/>
        <P>I could not help but contrast the attitude of the Labour Party spokesperson on the economy in the Seanad yesterday, who criticised it mildly and stated he would like to see more evidence to support its merits as it has no direct impact on the public finances, with that of the Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Bruton, who spoke on radio this morning and who was much more hard line in opposition.  I would like to make a prediction.  In my belief, the incoming government, regardless of what may be said during an election campaign, will not alter this decision.</P>
        <P>From the late 1990s through to 2008 there were increases in social welfare way above the rate of inflation.  We have had some deflation in our economy over the past couple of years.  I am not in the least suggesting that there is not some real reduction taking place but it has to be set in the context of the large increases previously.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A point is made quite frequently about political salaries, which have been reduced by approximately 20% at ministerial level.  People are asking what further sacrifices will be made.  The answer is in higher levels of taxation.  The salary of a Deputy is tied to that of principal officer and that of Senator is tied to assistant principal officer.  Under the Croke Park agreement no further reductions in salaries are contemplated.</P>
        <P>A question was asked about the basis of the projections of growth.  The answer is partly the background of a recovering world economy, but in particular the improvements in export competitiveness, where our exports have increased in real terms by 6% in the past year.</P>
        <P>There is to be a moratorium on new road starts in 2012 and 2013.  Even though this will affect my constituency, I think it is understandable.  A huge amount has been done.  The most recent analysis showed there is spare capacity on our roads and this is an area that in the current circumstances has to wait.  I am glad metro north will go ahead.  It is important, not least for our tourism industry, that our airport like other European airports should be rail connected to the city centre.</P>
        <P>I am glad to see that agriculture is relatively unscathed.  I am also pleased that my office, the Office of Public Works, despite having a cut in expenditure of more than one third, is able to undertake the essential jobs it is tasked with doing, especially flood relief which I have protected, and also ongoing heritage and building works.  As Minister of State, I am happy to stand over what is in the national recovery plan with regard to the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>All of this takes place against a much larger canvas, which is, as the German Government pointed out, an existential battle to maintain the eurozone in which we happen to be in the front line currently.  It is in our essential interest that this battle is won.  We, as eurozone members, must play our part.  We need to internalise the logic and the disciplines of belonging to the eurozone.  Perhaps in the early years we felt we did not have to or it all seemed to go more smoothly than we expected.  We have now seen the hard side of eurozone membership, but it is well worth persisting with it.  I have great hopes for the future of the economy and believe that despite the reservations that have been expressed about various parts of this plan by Opposition parties, the next Government &mdash; if it is the current Opposition &mdash; will largely adopt this plan and work with it as if it was their own.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment; Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>  his plans for consolidation of agencies and organisations under his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[44483/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>There are some 20 agencies under my remit, and as part of the rationalisation programme for State agencies I have an active consolidation programme in train that will reduce this number by six. </P>
        <P>In June 2009, I established the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency to amalgamate the national agencies that currently support our social and affordable housing programmes.  These are the National Building Agency, the Affordable Homes Partnership and the Centre for Housing Research.  The new agency was established on an administrative basis in May 2010 and when it is legislatively established next year, the existing three agencies will be wound up.  Pending legislation, the Local Government Management Services Board and the Local Government Computer Services Board are working very closely together on an administrative basis as the local government management agency.</P>
        <P>The administrative functions of the Rent Tribunalwere transferred to the Private Residential Tenancies Board with effect from 1 October 2009.  The functions of the Fire Services Councilare being undertaken by my Department since the term of office of its members expired on 30 June 2009 and it is not intended to reappoint a council.  The Limerick NorthsideandSouthside Regeneration Agencies are already serviced by a single executive.  In June 2010 the Government approved the formal merging of the agencies and work is ongoing in this regard.</P>
        <P>My Department is also working with all other agencies under my aegis to ensure that they are operating as efficiently as possible and complying with Government policy on public service finance and numbers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from his reply, does the Minister accept that in the context of the current financial climate it is essential to look at all of the agencies under his Department &mdash; just as will be done in every other Ministry &mdash; to ensure we do not deprive citizens of a service at the expense of retaining an agency or quango that should have its work carried out by the line Department?  Some 85 agencies and bodies can be identified at local and national level in the Minister&rsquo;s Department that could be merged or abandoned and the considerable savings that would accrue could yield a significant return that could help towards the difficulties the Department will have in the Estimates for 2011.  Will the Minister accept that he needs to revisit his policy and the agencies he has identified to date to ensure we have devolution of power from the central area to the local area, that we have greater accountability for the existing agencies and that we achieve greater efficiencies in line with the local government efficiency report in order to yield a better return for citizens at this time of straitened financial circumstances?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="256"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We should pursue greater efficiencies wherever we can make them.  However, I would point out that we are very much in line with the McCarthy report.  The Deputy mentioned the efficiency review group, which is a group I introduced and which does very good work under Mr. McLoughlin.  It has identified a number of efficiencies at local government level.  My Department is on course with regard to the McCarthy report and I have introduced another group to take a particular look at the Dublin area.  This group is about to start examining the boundaries.  However, wherever we attempt to introduce efficiencies, we always face a problem with some Fine Gael councillors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>A problem with Fine Gael councillors?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am afraid so.  Recently, I had a meeting with some Fine Gael councillors who objected to the idea of having the managers come together for various discussions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister not the boss?  That must have been the first time he listened to the Fine Gael councillors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I pointed out to them that this proposal was in the Fine Gael document, but I do not think they were familiar with that document.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister read it.  He must show leadership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, that is what happens.  It is all very well to be theoretical on these issues, but we must also apply some practical backbone and see whether we can carry out these recommendations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Deputy Hogan we must deal with this question within six minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  The Minister&rsquo;s response deserves another response.  The Chair will realise that over the past three and a half years the Minister has presided over the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA.  I am sure he is delighted with the work that has been carried out by the authority and that this work covers the Department in great glory.  I am surprised he has not listed the authority among the organisations he wishes to abandon, in view of the fact that the work is largely completed, with the exception of one or two sites that are now effectively derelict or in NAMA.  Will the Minister concede that there are several agencies like the DDDA that will yield considerable savings that could be brought back into the Department or agencies like the Temple Bar Cultural Trust that could be brought under the umbrella of the Dublin City Council?  Will he agree he could be more decisive with regard to the number of agencies he could examine with a view to terminating their existence in the interest of getting better value for money, greater accountability and more streamlined delivery of services for citizens?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Efficiencies have been made, in particular with regard to the organisation to which the Deputy has just referred and the authority has reduced staff numbers considerably.  The other agencies mentioned will be kept under constant review.  We are very cognisant of the fact that we are going through an unprecedented economic crisis and that we must, as a result, cut our cloth accordingly.  I have no difficulty in doing that.  We have made significant savings over the past number of years and as a result local authorities are suffering.  The local government fund has been reduced and local authorities have had to make huge <Col N="257"/>savings.  That will continue.  I believe we can make major savings through the kind of reforms we have recommended.  The amalgamation of the local authorities is not without controversy and it will take significant political will to introduce these political reforms, but I am happy to do that.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment; Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>  the position regarding the review of the severe weather events which was due to be completed by 1 November 2010; when he will attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss the Committee&rsquo;s own report and recommendations on the severe weather events; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[44487/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The response to a severe weather event generally involves cross-departmental co-ordination and collaboration.  My Department undertook the role of lead Department by chairing national level co-ordination in the case of last winter&rsquo;s severe weather events with local responses being undertaken by the principal response agencies in accordance with the major emergency management framework.</P>
        <P>Following these events, the Departments and agencies involved reviewed their experiences in terms of the lessons learned and these are now being considered further having regard to their completeness under the aegis of the government task force on emergency planning.  Departments and agencies represented on the task force are engaged in a range of associated work under five strands, as follows: national co-ordination; flood forecasting; road maintenance issues; humanitarian assistance; and major emergency management framework issues.</P>
        <P>In relation to the major emergency management framework, a detailed report on preparedness for and response to the severe weather events last winter is close to finalisation by my Department and will be presented to the Government task force on emergency planning as soon as possible.  This follows the earlier reviews undertaken by the principal response agencies, the results of which have been taken into account in their preparedness for future severe weather events.</P>
        <P>I am keeping the various recommendations made by the joint committee in mind having regard to this work and will be happy to meet it at a future date to discuss the contents of my Department&rsquo;s report when completed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the correspondence dated 27 October which was sent on the Minister&rsquo;s behalf to the joint committee.  This correspondence stated that he was unavailable to meet the committee to discuss its report and recommendations because he was completing his report which was due on 1 November.  The correspondence indicated that he expected to be in a position to respond to the committee&rsquo;s invitation once his report was completed.  He has now confirmed to the House that he failed to meet his 1 November deadline and more than one year after the severe weather events of 18 and 19 November 2009, he still has not completed the report.</P>
        <P>He indicated in the letters he sent to local authorities that some progress has been made on the issue.  Can he advise the House when his report will be complete?  Given that the outlines of the report have been set out, can he tell us when he will meet the joint committee to discuss its recommendations?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="258"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct.  I have stated unequivocally that we missed the 1 November deadline.  Despite the severe work pressures my Department faces, I hope we can complete the report in the next number of weeks. Once the report is completed I will have no difficulty meeting the joint committee, which I have already met on several occasions.  I have discussed the issue with individual Deputies and I am happy to discuss it further.</P>
        <P>However, as I have previously pointed out to the joint committee, the most important aspect of the severe weather events was that the primary routes were kept clear for the most part.  I am referring here to the snow and ice that affected the roads during cold snap as well as to the flooding which was the Deputy&rsquo;s main concern.  In regard to the latter issue, I travelled to Cork almost immediately to meet the city and county managers and discuss their requirements.  The money they needed was forthcoming almost immediately.</P>
        <P>I remind Deputies that while I have a specific role in flooding matters, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, has primary responsibility.  Subsequent to the publication of my report, we will have to decide who is the most appropriate person to deal with these matters.  I am happy to deal with matters that are of concern to the joint committee and I will answer as fully as I can the questions that arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the joint committee published its report in July, the Minister has had several months to come before it.  He is putting the cart before horse in terms of its recommendations because they could inform him in completing his own review.  He is following the wrong strategy by waiting until his report is completed before meeting the committee.  As he has not indicated a timeline for completion of his review, it is now unlikely that he will meet the committee to deal with the issues that arise.  When he appeared before the committee earlier this year, I suggested it would be unfair to ask him to make a value judgment  before our report was completed.  He agreed to take on board our recommendations but I suggest he is now prevaricating on them.</P>

	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s agenda included the Aarhus Convention, which has not been ratified, and the ban on corporate donations, which has not been introduced.  He has not published the promised White Paper on local government.  The number of infringements of EU law has increased since he became Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The voting machines have not been dealt with and apparently we will now be left with major legacy issues which arose before he came into office.  The report of the joint committee provides him with an opportunity to leave a positive legacy in regard to the events of 18 and 19 November 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Minister about one recommendation in particular from the committee&rsquo;s report.  Will he begin the process of establishing an independent inquiry into what led up to the events that caused &euro;100 million worth of damage to Cork city on 18 and 19 November?  Is he prepared to state this afternoon that he will take that recommendation on board?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="259"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy made a number of charges which were completely without foundation.  He claimed there is no likelihood that I will come before the committee but I have not said that.  He then raised extraneous matters which I will have to address.  He spoke about legacy issues but he voted against important elements of the planning legislation.  I assure him that the measures to which he referred will be introduced.</P>
        <P>On one of the occasions when I appeared before the joint committee, the Deputy left us while I was still answering members&rsquo; questions and came into this Chamber to ask why I was not here.  That is his way of operating and I find it objectionable.  Others may regard it as funny.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment; Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>  the impact on national planning and development policy that the National Asset Management Agency have had; if there are changes in existing planning and development policy as a result of NAMA; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[44484/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>National planning policy has undergone extensive reform through the recent enactment of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010.  Its provisions will address many of the legacy planning issues which contributed to the property price bubble.</P>
        <P>The Act ensures greater oversight, integration and consistency between spatial plans at national, regional and local levels.  It requires that an evidence based core strategy must be included in development plans to detail how such plans are consistent with the national spatial strategy, relevant regional planning guidelines and statutory planning guidelines and provide information on the quantum, location and phasing of lands zoned for development over the period of the plan.  Local authorities are required to introduce these core strategies into their development plans within one year of the adoption of the updated regional planning guidelines for the area.  The Act also introduced a number of other amendments including the provision of additional grounds for extension of the duration of planning permission where there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission.  A similar provision was introduced in the Act establishing the National Asset Management Agency.</P>
        <P>My Department is in contact with NAMA on a number of issues, including in regard to the issue of unfinished estates.  In this regard, NAMA is represented on the high level expert group on unfinished housing developments which was established to develop practical and policy solutions effectively to address unfinished housing developments.  The Department is also in contact with NAMA to ensure that wherever its aim to secure a sound return can be aligned with the Department&rsquo;s need to provide accommodation for disadvantaged households, this will be achieved.  The operation of NAMA is, of course, a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="260"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the Minister&rsquo;s reply, will he indicate to the House when the national spatial strategy review will be completed and published and if it will require a strategic environmental assessment in line with European law?  Has the Department plans to instruct local authorities, perhaps directly through NAMA, on the compilation of master plans in regard to the various sites that are derelict, particularly in the commercial and residential area?  Is this being considered to ensure we have proper planning and development arising from the fact there are so many sites in State ownership, with the largest property owner in the world being NAMA?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy repeat the second question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister instructing the local authorities or NAMA on the basis of good planning and development to draw up master plans in regard to the commercial and residential holdings that are in the ownership of the State with a view to ensuring, first, that we get some return on the investment which is now in the ownership of the State and, second, that we have good sustainable planning and development practice in regard to those properties?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of refreshing the national spatial strategy, work on that is still under way.  I hope I can give the Deputy a more specific date shortly, and I am happy to write to him to give that information.</P>
        <P>The second question referred to an SEA, or strategic environmental assessment.  We would have to seek advice on that specifically from the Attorney General to see whether an SEA is required.  It is always one of the most difficult questions because we are introducing SEAs in an increasing number of cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister knows that from the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I must seek specific advice from the Attorney General on that issue.</P>
        <P>Deputy Terence Flanagan has a question today on ghost estates and we have been in touch with the local authorities in this regard.  We are establishing an inventory of the ghost estates and operating with that to find what we can do quickly, and we are co-operating with NAMA in as efficient a way as possible.  As I said in my contribution, a member of NAMA is on that board to deal with that issue.</P>
        <P>The operation of NAMA is a matter for the Minister for Finance but we are dealing with the planning issues in my Department.  Particularly in the context of the new Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, we want to ensure we have a core strategy, that the regional planning guidelines are adhered to at all times and that we have an evidence based approach to planning matters.  For those reasons, we can be assured planning will be dealt with in a much more comprehensive way in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might outline to the House how exactly this planning function to which he refers in respect of NAMA properties will work.  It is fine to talk of evidence based strategy, core strategy and all of that.  What is the Minister doing to ensure we get proper planning and development in regard to the NAMA properties that are now in the hold of the State?  How will he ensure we get a return on those investments, particularly in housing?  A huge number of people are on social housing lists and we could marry demand and supply quite easily in a properly planned and sustainable way.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="261"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows section 42A was inserted in the planning Act by the NAMA Act 2009 to provide for planning extensions as they relate to planning permissions applicable to properties that have been taken into the ownership of NAMA.  Section 42A provides that an application to extend a planning permission can be made by NAMA before or up to two years after planning permission has expired, where such planning permission has expired during the years 2009, 2010 or 2011.</P>
        <P>Under section 42, including as amended by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act, other applicants will not be entitled to seek an extension after planning permission has expired.  The differentiation in this is justified because of the circumstance that NAMA might acquire land or property after the permission has expired and so would not be in a position to make an application for extension within the normal time limit.  More important, the provision is designed to protect and limit the overall financial exposure to the taxpayer and the State by optimising the potential value of developments or sites taken in by NAMA.  This is the point that has been made by the Deputy.  The concept of reinstituting an expired or dead permission is not catered for within the existing general planning code for other applicants and would be an unacceptable departure from planning legislation that deals with current planning permissions.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, we have tried to integrate good planning practice into NAMA.  We have to ensure the properties that have been taken into NAMA realise their value.  We have done that in the best possible way by ensuring best planning practice in the process.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment; Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>  the changes to policy and requirements on taxpayers that recent circulars from his Department concerning commercial motor tax have had; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[44485/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no change to the system of motor taxation in respect of goods vehicles.  My Department issued a circular letter to motor tax offices in August 2010 reminding authorised officers of existing provisions with regard to the taxation of vehicles on a goods basis.  This circular reiterated the terms of a 2005 circular letter.  To be taxed as a goods vehicle, a vehicle must be constructed or adapted for that purpose and used solely in the course of trade or business.  If a vehicle is adapted, it must have the same characteristics as a goods vehicle in regard to space and accommodation for carrying goods and it must have limited seating capacity.  In effect, this means that in order to be taxed in the goods category, the goods carrying area of the vehicle must be greater than the seating area, all seats to the rear of the driver&rsquo;s seat must be removed and seat bolt holes welded over and all rear seat belts must be removed and seat belt anchor points welded over.</P>
        <P>Under Section 2 of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952, if a vehicle is used in a condition or manner which would attract motor tax at a higher rate, tax then becomes payable at that rate.  In other words, if a goods vehicle is used in a private capacity, it must, like all other private vehicles, be taxed at the private rate of motor tax.  Under Article 3 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 1992, a licensing authority must be satisfied that a vehicle is correctly taxed, and it is thus open to a motor tax office to seek additional documentation supporting a claim for the goods rate of motor tax.  Such documentation may include a certificate of commercial insurance or evidence of registration for VAT purposes, or, at the discretion of the licensing authority concerned, any other appropriate <Col N="262"/>document.  In circumstances where an RF111A goods only declaration is required, an income tax registration number is now routinely sought.</P>
        <P>I would not expect that any person genuinely using a vehicle in the course of trade or business should have a difficulty supplying documentation to support a claim for what is, in effect, a concessionary rate of motor tax.  The requirement to sign the RF111A goods declaration form is not new and constitutes a statement by the applicant that the vehicle is being used in the course of trade or business.  I would not expect that this declaration should need to be sought at every renewal once particulars of the vehicle and its use have not changed since the last renewal.  The form would normally be sought at the time of first taxing as a goods vehicle and on change of ownership.  I reiterate that the legal provisions governing the taxation of goods vehicles have not changed.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I have submitted this question is that, although the legal provision may not have changed in respect of the application of motor tax to particular vehicles, there is no consistency of application.  There is genuine confusion among local authorities and citizens about the application of this provision arising from a circular sent in August.  There have been some changes to the documentation.  One is now required to provide more information on tax and VAT changes.  The primary purpose of the vehicles in question is the carriage of goods.  However, some local authorities are still seeking to interpret the provisions of the circular in a way that one cannot bring one&rsquo;s children to school or collect materials from the local shop without having garda&iacute;, who may wish to employ a strict interpretation of the law, stating the vehicle should be taxed differently under the motor tax code.  I ask the Minister to understand there is genuine confusion and revisit the circular in order to provide clarity.  It is not good enough to say garda&iacute; should overlook this aspect and be pragmatic.  In terms of application, this is either the law or it is not.  Does the Minister accept there is confusion?  Will he agree that it is necessary to reissue the circular in order to provide clarity for local authorities in order that the current farcical situation will not continue where there are different interpretations of the same circular from one local authority to another?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I return to the reason my Department issued the circular letter because it is important that we understand it.  It was brought to the attention of my Department by the Department of Transport that the number of vehicles being adapted to avail of the goods rate was increasing.  In some cases, they were high-powered, high-specification vehicles that would not be used for commercial purposes in the normal course of events.  Accordingly, my Department considered it appropriate to remind motor tax offices of the existing provisions regarding the taxation of vehicles as goods vehicles.  As in the case of any tax compliance matter, this is important.  Some 1.9 million motorists pay tax on their private cars, while some 340,000 goods vehicles are taxed by businesses.  To be fair to these individuals and businesses, it is important, as I hope the Deputy will agree, that the correct rate of tax is paid in all cases and that the potential for abuse of the system is restricted.</P>
        <P>The Deputy claims there is a lack of consistency in the application of the circular across motor tax offices.  The legislation and procedures applicable to the taxation of goods vehicles apply equally to eveybody.  However, each applicant and application is different.  As I stated, under Article 3 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 1992, there is an onus on the licensing authority to be satisfied that it is authorised to issue the licence applied for and, accordingly, that the said licence is the appropriate one for the vehicle.  The supporting documentation that may be sought as evidence in this regard may vary from applicant to applicant.  It has always been the case that discretion is required and such discretion <Col N="263"/>is given to the authorised officer.  I do not believe there has been a case in which an individual who is a bona fide user of a van and merely drops into a shop for a bottle of milk or drops his or her children off at school has been brought to task by the Garda.  Perhaps the Deputy knows of such a case, but I have no such evidence and none has been brought to my attention.  If the Deputy has such evidence, I ask him to bring it to my attention because I do not believe it to be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to be brief because we need to move on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot let that go.  In terms of the application of this provision, I am aware of cases in which individuals used to pay about &euro;400 in motor tax, but when the new regulations were issued or the new interpretation by the local authority came into play, some of these individuals had to pay &euro;1,200.  I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House have been in touch with the Minister to bring such matters to his attention.  I do not know anything about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am not in charge of the Garda anymore than the Minister is and do not know what it does from day to day.  All I know is that the application of this provision under the commercial motor tax code has caused genuine confusion.  I would have thought the best way of dealing with the matter since August would have been to state the new regulation to be applied was a vehicle would have to be solely and wholly used for the carriage of goods.  That is a reasonable suggestion.  What the Minister should do &mdash; if he will indulge my suggestion &mdash; is reissue the circular and say exactly what it means because there is a misinterpretation between local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether the Deputy has had an opportunity to read the circular, but it is crystal clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have read it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It states: &ldquo;Dear authorised officer, it has come to our attention that an increasing number of vehicles have changed their tax class from private to adapted goods...  Your attention is drawn to circular MT10/2005, copy attached, which deals with this issue&rdquo;.  In simple terms, it reiterates what was contained in the circular of 2005.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>And adds to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>In other words, nothing has changed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy continues to refer to &ldquo;new&rdquo; regulations.  There are no new regulations.  The regulation is available and plain for anyone to see.  It mentions Article 3 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 1992.  We are talking, therefore, about regulations that appeared in 1992.  The Deputy has been in government since that time.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I have not.</P>

	<P>The Minister is going back to the Dark Ages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s party applied the same regulations, something which has been overlooked in much of the related commentary.  Successive Governments have applied them.  There should be supporting documentation which can include but is not limited to certain <Col N="264"/>items.  This is what is stated very clearly in the circular.  I refer to the circular of 2005 which mentions evidence of registration for VAT, a tax clearance certificate, a commercial insurance certificate and a copy of the applicant&rsquo;s notice of tax registration form.  This is one of those issues that, unfortunately, took hold in the silly season in August, but there was no substance to it.  The position remains exactly the same.  However, it is clear that in order to save money some individuals were abusing the system.  I do not believe the Deputy would agree with this.  If a person is abusing the system, it means somebody else has to pay more money, which is wrong.</P>

	<P>The national housing development survey database which was published on 22 October establishes an authoritative baseline analysis at a national level of unfinished housing developments to assist in fully understanding the scale and extent of the issues involved.  It establishes a sound basis for assisting local authorities in identifying those developments that require priority interventions by the key stakeholders concerned such as developers, financial institutions and local authorities.</P>
        <P>The high level expert group on unfinished housing developments, established following the publication of the survey, is actively developing practical and policy solutions to effectively address unfinished housing developments, including preparation of a guidance manual and code of practice.  I expect that the guidance manual which will be issued for public consultation shortly in draft form will, <i>inter alia</i>, identify the type of developments and issues that need to be prioritised for action in the short term; the final manual and code of practice will be published early next year.  The group is also tasked with identifying new measures that should be considered, including any matters for future legislative reform, to ensure the satisfactory resolution of issues associated with unfinished estates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response, but it gives very little hope to the thousands of homeowners living in unbearable conditions in many ghost developments which give rise to major health and safety issues.  Clearly, the Minister&rsquo;s Department was not up to speed in keeping tabs on what was happening throughout the country because it underestimated tenfold the number of ghost estates.  What he must do now is give a sense of hope to homeowners and ensure they will not have to continue to live on building sites.  The Minister has kicked to touch a final decision as to what he will do about these housing estates.  I ask him to respond with some solutions as to how he will deal with ghost estates throughout the country.</P>

	<P>Deputy Flanagan, please stop interrupting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>In excess of 2,800 housing developments were identified where construction had commenced but had not yet been completed.  It was wrong for some of the media commentators to characterise every one of the developments inspected by my Department as a so-called &ldquo;ghost estate&rdquo;, a phrase which was constantly used.  Such reporting is not just incorrect, it is sometimes irresponsible.  As the detail of the survey shows, many of the developments have been completed, are fully occupied and perhaps have only minor completion issues outstanding, such as the provision of a final road surface. </P>
        <P>Some 147 developments in the survey are fully completed but less than 10% of the completed units are occupied and 50% of the development surveyed are quite small, comprising 30 dwellings or less, with 25% comprising 10 dwellings or less.  There are 1,050 developments which are potentially of concern because they are developments which are substantially incomplete but have significant occupancy.  They are the ones the Deputy is most concerned about and I understand that.</P>
        <P>Considering that there are approximately 1,000 substantially incomplete but significantly occupied developments, further analysis will reveal that the smaller proportion of these developments, probably in the region of 200 to 300, are in particular distress and are causing most concern.  Distressed developments are those in which a developer or a receiver acting on behalf of the financial institution is not present and addressing outstanding completion issues.  We have to ensure that the expert group, to which I referred, will actively pursue the issue and develop practical and policy solutions to ensure a satisfactory resolution of unfinished housing developments, and particularly the category to which I referred which includes people who are in particular distress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the Minister&rsquo;s response.  Clearly, his Department was asleep at the wheel in a similar manner to the Financial Regulator.  If he was on top of his brief he would have known what was happening on the ground.  What is needed is hope for home owners.  What hope will he give to home owners where developers have left and are bankrupt and NAMA is now in control of the housing estates?  What provision will he include in his departmental accounts to pick up the tab and put these housing estates to right in order that people can get on with their lives and live in housing estates which do not have any health and safety risks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, a guidance manual is being developed and I expect it to set out the roles and responsibilities of the key stakeholders in addressing unfin<Col N="266"/>ished housing development, identify the type of developments and issues that need to be prioritised for action in the short term, summarise the wide range of statutory powers currently at the disposal of local authorities to resolve those urgent matters, and establish organisational context leadership on this issue at local authority and national levels, building on existing best practice approaches that have been developed in Ireland and elsewhere in dealing with the issue.</P>
        <P>We are identifying the provisions and powers which can be used to remedy those problems.  For example, under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 local authorities are empowered to direct the owner or occupier of land which is or may become derelict to take measures necessary to prevent it from becoming or continuing to be a derelict site.  The carrying out of any work specified in the notice is exempted development.  The legal definition of &ldquo;derelict sites&rdquo; is broad and could be adapted to abandoned residential housing estates.  Local authorities could use the Derelict Sites Act in a targeted fashion to address sites which have become derelict under the stewardship of aberrant owners or occupiers.</P>
        <P>We are doing a lot and we can use other legislation.  The Deputy should be assured that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, is dealing with this issue.  He launched the document on ghost or unfinished estates.  As we have published that report, we are ensuring that the problem will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

        <Quest>  the position regarding the proposed review of foreshore legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 34 together. </P>
        <P>Short-term administrative and regulatory measures are being introduced to improve the throughput of foreshore applications by my Department, which has been working with the Department of Finance on a business process improvement exercise in the foreshore area.</P>
        <P>This process has been completed and the recommended actions are now being implemented.  These include the introduction of a pre-application consultation process; the development of a scheme of prioritisation for foreshore applications; introducing regulations to put a time limit on consultations with prescribed bodies; the development of standard operating procedures; the development of an application tracking database; and the publication of guidelines for applicants in relation to engineering and habitats issues.</P>
        <P>The operation of the foreshore consent process is governed primarily by the Foreshore Act 1933 which has been the subject of only limited updating since its enactment.  Work has commenced in my Department to develop a modernised foreshore consent regime and to integrate it within the planning system.  This includes preparatory work towards the necessary legislative changes to integrate strategic foreshore projects within the consent process under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, other foreshore projects within the wider <Col N="267"/>planning system and assessment of the requirements for the development of a marine spatial plan.</P>
        <P>The draft offshore renewable energy development plan, and the associated strategic environmental assessment report, recently published by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, and currently undergoing a public consultation process, will inform the development of the consent regime, as it relates to offshore renewable energy projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister indicate the average timescale for an application for a foreshore licence to be dealt with?  What is the timescale envisaged for the introduction of the primary legislation to which he referred?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation is being developed and is at an early stage.  It is extremely comprehensive.  The original legislation dates from 1933.  The Department is dealing with quite a number of outstanding issues.  That is not in the main body of our current work but I hope we can give it priority in the new year.  A foreshore licence can only be issued if it is in the public interest.</P>
        <P>The current processing of a foreshore application includes the assessment of the application by the Department&rsquo;s internal technical advisers and, where necessary, the marine licence vetting committee which advises on scientific matters; consultation with statutory and non-statutory consultees, including the relevant Departments and agencies; a period of public consultation, which is normally 21 days; valuation of the site to be occupied by the applicant and other public interest elements which may arise in particular cases; obtaining the necessary legal advice; and Department of Finance sanction, where appropriate.</P>
        <P>I can give the Deputy some idea of the number of foreshore cases we have inherited from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  There are 700 foreshore cases following the transfer of functions and full caseload analysis was undertaken to determine the status of the cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>The position is as follows.  There are 300 live cases at various stages in the consent process &mdash; they are being progressed &mdash; of which 30 of them are strategy cases &mdash; priority one.  There are 200 cases which are not active and to be closed off.  There are 180 offshore renewable energy applications which will be considered in the context of the finalised offshore renewable energy plan and there are 82 enforcement-legal cases.  There is a scheme of priorities &mdash; priority one, priority two and priority three &mdash; which the Department has developed.</P>
        <P>The level of caseload in the Department is as follows.  Since the functions transferred to my Department earlier this year more than 26 foreshore applications have been determined, 14 of these cases were determined in less than 20 weeks, another 300 cases are being progressed through the various stages of the consent process and 15 cases are close to determination.</P>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to pursue another aspect of the foreshore licence issue and place it in context.  Foreshore licences are granted where somebody is developing a marina, a docking bay or something else which would generate local employment and improve the general aspect and environment of a location.</P>
        <P>One of the difficulties people face relates to a specific clause in the licence.  I am aware the Minister has inherited this from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries but there is a difficulty with section 12(2).  Is the Minister aware of it and if so, is he dealing with it?  The section allows the Minister to revoke a foreshore licence having given three months notice.</P>
        <P>The difficulty people have when acquiring foreshore licences is that when they seek funding from financial institutions to proceed with the development of a marina, a docking area etc., <Col N="268"/>they find the financial institutions will not fund the application because of this section in the legislation.  The financial institutions say people do not have security of tenure in regard to the licence for a specific period of time.</P>
        <P>The legislation states that the Minister can, at a whim or without any explanation, revoke the licence.  That makes it impossible for people to get funding from financial institutions.  Is the Minister aware of this difficulty and does he intend to amend the legislation to resolve it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been brought to my attention but I do not know of any instance where a Minister has exercised that power.  I have tried to determine that.  An inconsistency of this sort will be part of a review of the legislation.  There are priority one, priority two and priority three procedures in place.  The Deputy is talking about priority three, so it is down the list.  These refer to outfall pipes, if they are not part of a larger strategic infrastructure project, private boat moorings and extension of existing piers, slipways or jetties.  They are down the list of priority and as far as the Department is concerned, far more major projects must be considered.  We are getting through the list.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy has a specific case in mind and if he drops me a line, I will look into it to see if there is undue delay.  It is of concern if an individual cannot secure finance because there is a fear that having been granted the foreshore licence, it could be revoked at a later stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to be of assistance to the Minister.  He is correct about the revocation of licences.  However, the difficulty relates to funding.  People go through the planning process and acquire the foreshore licence but they cannot get a letter of comfort from the Department stating that the licence will not be revoked or stating the conditions on which it could be revoked.  I will take the Minister up on his offer.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact this is dealt with on a case by case basis but it does not deal with the overall difficulty.  It is not that licences have been revoked but given the constraints financial institutions face and the fact the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland issued a directive to all banks in July to tighten up on lending practices, there is a difficulty with this existing clause in respect of loans.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 7 and 49 together. </P>
        <P>The findings and recommendations of the report of the independent local government efficiency review group are for consideration by the Government in the appropriate policy and financial contexts.  I propose shortly to establish an implementation group with an independent chairperson to oversee implementation of relevant recommendations in line with Government decisions.  The group&rsquo;s terms of reference will generally set out the recommendations to be covered by it and those which are matters for the Government to determine.  This group will also build on the extensive efficiencies already achieved by local authorities over the past two years or so.</P><Col N="269"/>
        <P>In the meantime, I have taken action to progress implementation of certain recommendations.  In this context I have recently established a group, chaired by Mr. Pat McLoughlin who also chaired the efficiency review group, to carry out a review of the staffing complement and number of senior managers in Dublin City Council.  I have asked the Dublin review group to report within six months with their recommendations on the actions to be taken to reduce the staffing complement.  Similar arrangements will be put in place in respect of Cork City Council.</P>
        <P>Specific measures to modernise local government are also under way in parallel with the efficiency review group&rsquo;s recommendations.  These include implementation of the transforming public services programme and the Croke Park agreement in local authorities in areas such as shared services, HR, ICT and procurement.  A directly elected mayor for Dublin, the legislation for which is currently before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, will lead and promote efficiency in the Dublin region.  A dedicated Cabinet committee has been engaged in finalising the policy decisions for inclusion in the White Paper on Local Government.   A more efficient local government system will be a core objective of the White Paper.  I am satisfied that these measures represent a comprehensive and targeted approach to achieving further efficiencies in local government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has given us some indication about another set of committees he is establishing to make decisions.  He has a group called the local government efficiency review group chaired by Mr. McLoughlin and he has recommendations.  Why does he not seek to implement them rather than set up another group?  Why must he sideline all his actions, which are important in terms of local government, to another implementation group in order to slow down the delivery of the recommendations of the review group?</P>
        <P>The Minister promised us electoral reform measures in 2008 but we have not yet seen them.  He also promised a White Paper on Local Government which we have not yet seen.  He has committees sitting and reports coming in which are gathering dust.</P>
        <P>With respect, all we hear is that the Minister will not make a decision but will send it off to another review group or implementation group and that he is one step away from executing the decisions.</P>

	<P>There is the recommendation to implement the manager for two county-city councils.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not.  Will the Minister restate the last comment, which I found interesting, that the reduction of the minimum wage came about on the insistence of Commissioner Ollie Rehn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it was one of the things he said.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very relevant to people outside the House, given that employers I spoke to were not seeking it.  They sought reform of the JLC.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should concentrate on the subject matter in the questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give the Minister a certain degree of flexibility on the matter.  When he announced the Green Paper a number of years ago, the McCarthy report and the local government efficiency review group followed.  Ultimately, the position remains the same and question is where the structure of local government lies.  As the Minister is well aware, the structure is laid out by the terms of funding and how those structures are applied.</P>
        <P>Where is the White Paper on local government?  There were two significant reports in the McCarthy report and the local government efficiency review group report and the Minister will have taken cognisance of both of those in the move from a Green Paper to a White Paper.  Will we see the White Paper before Christmas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the Deputy that he will see it.  The problem is we have had so many different initiatives to put in place.  For example, yesterday the four year plan was published with significant proposals relating to funding for local government, including the local charge.  All that must be consistent with the White Paper.  We will now proceed with the White Paper, which will include those very important revenue raising powers for local authorities.</P>
        <P>For the first time we will be in a position where local authorities will be self-financing.  I have always felt that 1977 was a crucial election because local government was emasculated and it has not properly recovered since.  There has been an erosion in the powers of local councillors, greater powers for managers and it will take some time to recover from that.  Similarly, revenue raising powers were gone and there was a concentration on commercial rates and the local government fund.  If these powers are not in place there is no local government but local administration instead.  That is the emphasis of the Green Paper and it will be the emphasis of the White Paper.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of initiatives in this respect.  The Bill relating to the Dublin mayoralty is going through the House currently and that is a vital step in the right direction in revitalising local Government in this country.  We have never had a directly elected mayor in <Col N="272"/>this country and it is about time we had.  It is about time for us to have greater powers at local level.  Over the past number of years I have noticed that managers are becoming ever more powerful in this country and as a result, local councillors feel they must develop a relationship with the manager to get things done so they do not rock the boat too much.  It is happening on an increasing basis.</P>

	<P>In response to its challenging financial position, the executive board of the authority has undertaken a major review and restructuring of its activities, cutting all discretionary expenditure and reducing staff levels from 55 full-time equivalents in January 2009 to 27 staff currently.  Whereas the authority&rsquo;s 2009 annual report and audited accounts, which were published earlier this year, indicate progress was made in 2009 in stabilising the authority&rsquo;s day-to-day financial performance, the authority continues to face financial challenges with an operating loss of &euro;7.4 million, compared with &euro;27.1million in 2008; impairment losses and write-downs of &euro;11.2 million, compared with &euro;185.8 million in 2008; a reduction in the authority&rsquo;s net assets to &euro;4.1 million, compared to &euro;26.2 million in 2008; and borrowing within, but close to, the borrowing limit of &euro;127 million.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the prevailing uncertainty in the property and housing market will impact on the authority&rsquo;s development activities, and the outcome of its engagement with the National Asset Management Agency regarding the resolution of outstanding debts in the Becbay joint venture will also be central to the authority&rsquo;s overall future financial position.  Achieving further progress towards a break-even position remains a key objective, and the authority is in ongoing discussion with my Department and the Department of Finance on its financial position and outlook.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The financial position of the authority has been a source of great concern for a considerable period.  Will the Minister bring forward proposals to limit the damage this organisation has caused to its finances and the damage done because of recklessness exhibited towards staff which have been let go?  They have had to leave the organisation because of the activities of a few people.  Will any accountability be sought from the board members who have served in this organisation since its establishment for the manner in which they have led this organisation into disrepute and the current financial position?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I appointed a new chairperson, Professor Niamh Brennan, to take control of the authority.  She was instrumental in producing two reports which demonstrated exactly what had happened in the Dublin docklands.  Recently I spoke to board members who feel the authority is now finding its feet again and I hope it will be in a position to do some very good work for the community.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, this legislation was not introduced by this Government but rather by my constituency colleague, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  The idea behind it is good and it has provided some good employment in the area and has done some very good community work.  I hope that under the stewardship of Professor Niamh Brennan the docklands authority can improve its financial position.  It faces enormous difficulties and there are ongoing problems.</P>
        <P>I have always indicated to Deputy Hogan that there are difficulties in this country in tackling white-collar crime.  This includes people who have abused their positions.  I am aware of the <Col N="273"/>individuals who the Deputy may be referring to in this case and I believe our legislation is not strong enough.  We must improve and we are going to ensure we can have more effective whistleblower legislation to identify problems in the first instance.  There should also be strong legislation to ensure that those who engage in white-collar criminality can be brought to justice as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have always made clear that I want to see a sustainable, resource based approach to waste management.  This involves a shift in focus from residual waste management options, such as landfill and incineration, to technologies such as mechanical biological treatment which can maximise the value to be extracted from what should be viewed as a resource rather than as a waste. </P>
        <P>On 15 July 2010, I published a draft statement of waste policy for public consultation which set out the various elements being considered as part of the development of a new national waste management policy for the coming decade and beyond.  In particular, the draft statement emphasised the importance of waste policy being informed by domestic policy goals, EU and wider international policy and practice, and EU legislation and commitments, particularly the revised waste framework directive and the associated waste hierarchy set out in Article 4 of the directive.  The draft statement contained a range of proposals, including, in relation to waste management, planning at national and regional levels.  The consultation period closed on 1 October last and I am working to conclude a final waste policy statement, having given my fullest consideration to all the submissions received.</P>
        <P>I intend to bring the final policy statement to Government for decision shortly.  Following the Government&rsquo;s decision, I will publish the final policy which will provide certainty for those in the waste management sector and a framework within which the necessary legislative changes can be brought forward.</P>

	<P Just="Left">When does the Minister expect clarity to be provided on the proposed incinerator for the Poolbeg peninsula?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have stated on a number of occasions, the Government does not determine matters of this nature, which in this case is one for a private consortium and the local authority.  When one considers residual waste arisings and the decline in biological waste, which is the most important consideration from a landfill directive perspective, an incinerator with a capacity of 600,000 tonnes is much too large.  We must move towards mechanical biological treatment and ensure, when we embark on a strategy, that we have available to us sufficient waste for a facility of this type.  We must avoid creating a white elephant which will cost the taxpayer a large amount of money.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of the incinerator proposed for the Poolbeg peninsula, the contract which was signed against my advice commits Dublin City Council to providing 320,000 tonnes of waste per annum.  Penalty clauses will apply if this level of waste is not provided and the local authority would have to pick up the tab.  By bringing to Government the waste levies and a new <Col N="274"/>policy statement, as I will do shortly, we will provide greater clarity on the proposed Poolbeg incinerator.</P>
        <P>I have read media reports, which the Deputy has probably also read, to the effect that the company in question has indicated that if I introduce levies and publish a policy document, it will not proceed with the incinerator proposal.  I am committed to proceeding with a new waste policy.  A large multinational company should not dictate national waste policy, which is a matter for the sovereign Government.</P>

    <sTitle>Special Educational Needs</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me an opportunity to raise this important issue.</P>
        <P>The Government has a poor record in assisting children with special needs.  In the most recent budget many special needs assistants lost their jobs and the forthcoming budget and four year plan include plans to axe further special needs assistants.  This is a disgrace.</P>
        <P>The Government has turned its back on sufferers of dyslexia.  When the country was wealthy it did not carry out a study to discover how many children suffer from the condition.  For the past ten years, the Department of Education and Skills has not once increased the small annual grant of &euro;63,500 it provides to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland.  The Government clearly has the wrong priorities when it fails to adequately fund associations such as the DAI and chooses instead to pay lip service to their work.  It has squandered billions of euro in the past ten years and it is the most vulnerable who are paying the price.</P>
        <P>I propose to raise some questions on Government policy on educational provision for children with autism spectrum disorder.  It is estimated that the Department of Education and Skills has spent in excess of &euro;80 million on a pilot project for ABA schools in the past ten years.  The project was terminated without undertaking a proper evaluation of the effectiveness of the ABA pilot schools.</P>
        <P>During a recent meeting with parents of children in one of the pilot schools a departmental official referred to a 2006 report entitled, An Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders, which features details of visits to some of the ABA pilot <Col N="275"/>schools carried out in 2001-02.  The decision to close the ABA schools was based on reviews which had taken place eight years previously in a sample of the pilot schools.  This is an example of highly flawed decision making.</P>
        <P>Having spent almost &euro;80 million on a pilot project, the Government has failed to evaluate the project adequately.  This failure and the absence of a proper cost benefit analysis of ABA schools is a wanton waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money and a dereliction of duty on the part of the Government.</P>
        <P>The Department decided to replace ABA schools with special schools and ASD units which employ what is described as an eclectic approach to educating children with autism.  However, no research has been produced to support the use of the Department&rsquo;s preferred approach.  Departmental officials admitted recently that this was the case and the Department does not have any plans to evaluate ASD units.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Skills is pumping millions of euro into a teaching model whose effectiveness has not been evaluated.  She clearly does not have an interest in the children who are affected by this decision.  ABA schools have produced terrific results for children with autism.  The Government should listen to the views expressed by parents on the teaching methods they want to have provided for their children.  The young children in question deserve better from the State.  They are being let down by the decisions that have been taken on this matter.  Consequently, I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills to re-examine this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise that the T&aacute;naiste cannot be present this evening.  I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan.  I thank Deputy Terence Flanagan for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding provision for children with special educational needs and to outline the enormous progress made in recent years on supports for these children.  I wish to make clear that the education of children with special educational needs has, and remains, a key priority for the Government.  The Government has put huge resources into schools to enable them to meet the demands of children with special educational needs.  To this end, more than &euro;1 billion has been allocated in the 2010 Department budget to support special education in schools.</P>
        <P>Deputy Flanagan will be aware that the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 requires that all children with special educational needs shall be educated in an inclusive environment with children who do not have such needs unless the nature or degree of the need is such that to do so would be inconsistent with the best interests of the child or the effective provision of education for children with whom the child is to be educated.  The Department of Education and Skills provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools that enrol pupils with special educational needs to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, he or she will have access to an appropriate education.  Children with special educational needs may be enrolled in a mainstream school and attend all mainstream classes.  Children who are fully integrated may receive additional teaching support through the learning support teacher or the resource teacher or both.  If the child has care needs, he or she may receive support from a special needs assistant, SNA.  In other cases, a child with special needs may enrol in a mainstream school and attend a special class.  This provides an option of partial inclusion in mainstream classes in line with the child&rsquo;s abilities.  Alternatively, if appropriate, the child may enrol in a special school.  The Department supports special classes and special schools through the provision of lower pupil teacher ratios for such classes, ranging from 6:1 to 11:1, the provision of SNAs and enhanced levels of capitation funding.</P><Col N="276"/>
        <P>At present, the Department funds more than 9,000 whole-time equivalent learning support-resource teacher posts, more than 10,000 whole-time equivalent SNA posts and more than 1,000 teachers in special schools.  In addition, enhanced capitation funding is paid to special schools and in respect of special classes in mainstream schools.  The Department also provides more than &euro;50 million annually for special school transport arrangements and &euro;1.3 million on assistive technology.  Extensive teacher training and continuing professional development in the area of special educational needs is provided through the special education support service, SESS.  In 2009, the SESS funded more than 23,000 teacher places in courses on special education.  A visiting teacher service also is in place for children who are blind, visually impaired, deaf or hard of hearing.  To further support the inclusion of children with special needs, all new school buildings and extensions are designed to enable access for all and the Department provides funding to adapt existing school buildings where required.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through its network of more than 80 local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, supports schools, parents, children and teachers and will continue to do so in line with the Department&rsquo;s policy.</P>
        <P>I again assure Deputy Flanagan that even in the current economic climate, the provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children with special educational needs will continue to be a key Government priority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It has come to my attention that a positron emission tomography, PET, scanner located in Cork is not operational.  In addition, I understand that only one such publicly-owned scanner, located in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin, is in operation in the State.  The cost of installing this scanner in Cork was &euro;3.8 million and I am informed the overall cost of the centre there was &euro;6.8 million.  Although the machine was installed at a cost of millions of euro, it is not in operation and other issues arise in this regard.  I am informed that nationally, a total of 5,551 PET scans were carried out in the eight months from January to August 2010, only 199 of which came from the southern region.  It appears as though people may not be getting this service because they are obliged to travel to Dublin to avail of it.  Last year, it cost &euro;1 million for people from the south to travel to Dublin to undergo scans, even though the aforementioned machine is sitting idle in Cork.  People are obliged to travel to Dublin at their own expense and I am sure the Minister of State realises that people who are obliged to do this may have cancer or may be quite ill and that this is stressful, time-consuming and expensive.</P>
        <P>Why has this machine and its associated centre been sitting idle in Cork for so long at great expense to the State?  Why are people being forced to travel to Dublin for scans?  How many people are waiting for scans within the HSE at present and for how long?  Why is the scanner located in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in operation while the one located in Cork is not?  What staff are needed to make the PET scanner operational and how much would it cost to employ them?  One should bear in mind that &euro;6.8 million already has been spent in an unused investment, which surely constitutes a waste.  I understand that Cork University Hospital, CUH, applied for a radiologist post in May 2009.  What is the position with regard to that post?  Has it been funded or approved?  As I stated, the cost to HSE south for scans in Dublin for 2008, 2009 and the first eight months of 2010 has been more than &euro;1 million, even though a machine is available in Cork.  Moreover, I presume that more money has been spent subsequently.</P>
        <P>This is a serious issue.  The CUH is the cancer centre of excellence for the south of Ireland and it would make sense &mdash; I am sure it is Government policy &mdash; to have this PET scanner up and running.  I realise the Minister of State probably has to hand a pre-prepared script that he <Col N="277"/>is about to read out and that he probably is unable to answer any of the questions I have asked.  However, I ask him to revert to me privately with the answers at some point.  This exemplifies the farce that is the Adjournment debate.  One cannot have a proper debate even though Members have tried to effect changes and reform but nothing at all has happened.  I am glad that a senior Minister is present in the Chamber to hear this point.  However, this is a serious life and death issue to which people in the south seek answers, as do the medical staff, those who are suffering from cancer and the taxpayers who have spent &euro;6.8 million to date for a facility that is lying idle.  When will this centre become operational and when can the investment be put to work for the people?  When will the patients in that region have the use of this important facility?</P>
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I again apologise that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, cannot be present to take this Adjournment matter, which I will take on her behalf.  PET-CT scanning is one of a number of sophisticated diagnostic tools used in acute hospital settings in the diagnosis and management of disease.  In 2006, the HSE decided to procure a PET-CT scanner for Cork University Hospital, CUH.  As the Deputy is aware, construction of the new facility and installation of the scanner was completed in 2009.  The Government has made clear that a critical part of its strategy to restore the public finances is to achieve sustainability in the cost of delivering public services relative to State revenues.  To help achieve this goal, it will be necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and to reduce public service numbers over the coming years.  This requires that the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the health service will continue to apply until the numbers have fallen to the level set out in the employment control framework for the health sector.  The framework gives effect to the Government decision on employment policy in the public sector and provides that there will be a net reduction in employment.  This includes a target reduction in numbers of 1,520 in 2010 and consequential payroll savings.  There is provision in the HSE&rsquo;s employment control framework for some exemptions and exceptions, such as medical consultants and certain diagnostic support staff.  However, these are limited, because of the need to achieve the required payroll savings.  Health employment levels are monitored by the joint employment control monitoring committee, comprising officials from Departments of Health and Children and Finance and the HSE.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>With regard to Cork, I am pleased to confirm to Deputy Stanton that funding has been provided for a consultant radiologist with a special interest in PET-CT and this post will be considered by the HSE&rsquo;s consultant appointments advisory committee at its November meeting.  As the recruitment and appointment of a permanent consultant can take several months, it is intended to fill the post in a temporary capacity until a permanent appointment can be<?oasys _jy ?>made.</P>
     
        <P>In addition, the recruitment process for a number of critical support staff will commence in January 2011.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, it is intended to proceed with the PET/CT service at Cork University Hospital early in the new year.  In the transitional period before the PET/CT in the hospital becomes operational, patients will continue to travel to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital or the Mater Hospital in Dublin, with which the HSE has service level agreements for provision of PET/CT services.  In 2009, a total of 108 patients from the Cork and Kerry region were referred to St. James&rsquo;s and the Mater, in line with service level agreements in place.</P>
        <P>The HSE is working to bring this project into operation as soon as possible, to ensure that the people of Cork and Kerry have easy access to the most advanced diagnostics available and that better outcomes are achieved for patients. I am very pleased that this important and worthwhile development can go ahead.  I hope this is a change from what he expected.</P>

    <sTitle>East West Interconnector</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment because it is of grave concern to the people of Rush, where 3,000 people, from a population of 9,000 marched to show their concern.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House to address this important issue.</P>
        <P>I am fully supportive of the interconnector.  It is a hugely important part of the future infrastructure of the country and an integral part of our strategy to encourage renewable energy and eventually to make Ireland an exporter of electricity.  In the interim it will be important in securing electricity supply, should we not be in a position to create it ourselves.  However, I raise a number of issues with regard to the project.</P>
        <P>Only 43 people attended the original planning meeting because the people of Rush were not then aware of the project.  Let us compare that figure with the 3,000 who marched.  Meetings were held between EirGrid and the community group and an independent expert, who would be agreed by the community and EirGrid, was promised.  Instead of this, EirGrid appointed a man who, while of some international repute, was not agreed by the community.  Besides, within his report there is no mention of what is called the rubbish electricity which causes problems and is associated with a DC cable.  Furthermore, a KEMA report was to be agreed, and that is ongoing.  No work was to start until the KEMA report was complete but EirGrid have gone ahead with work, opening the road yesterday morning.</P>
        <P>This morning, there were scuffles with garda&iacute;.  These peaceful people are the solid citizens of Rush.  Many of them are rate payers.  Business people and families are concerned about the disruption and the effect of this project on their town.  There may be questions about the safety of the cable itself.  There are health and safety issues.  I am not an expert and do not profess to say if it is safe or not, but I know the people have grave concerns.  While one cannot say anything is fully affected, if it is rerouted out of the town it will be fully safe because it will no longer be going up the street.</P>
        <P>The manner in which the people of Rush have been treated is scandalous.  Women were approached late last night in their own gardens by men pointing torches in their eyes to serve injunctions on them.  Why did EirGrid not give notice that injunctions were to be served instead of behaving in this heavy-handed intimidatory fashion?  It is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The Meath county manager refused to allow EirGrid to lay a cable through the main street of Ratoath and it was rerouted around the town.  Fingal County Council was to have voted on the matter but it was taken off the agenda and permission was got by some other means.  Some councillors had promised to vote against it.</P>
        <P>There are alternative routes.  The lack of good faith shown by EirGrid in not appointing an agreed health expert, in failing to wait for the KEMA safety report and, now, in serving injunctions late at night is abhorrent to me.  I ask the Minister to reroute this cable partially out of Rush.  This would not be a huge job.  There are existing alternatives, and I do not refer to the estuary.  There are alternatives north of Rush which can be used.</P>
        <P>The people of Rush are extremely upset.  An unsafe stand-off is being created there.  I appealed to everyone to keep calm but I appeal to the Minister, within whose gift this is, to order this to be rerouted.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister will tell us this project is funded from Europe.  That is fine.  Can he tell us when that funding must be drawn down?  When I asked him on a previous occasion he could not tell me if it would be in January or December 2012, or if it would be 2012 at all.  The cost of the cable, which is difficult to ascertain, is not an issue.  The cable will be required, whatever route is taken.</P>
        <P>I appeal, on behalf of the people of Rush, to have their voice heard.  I never thought I would see the day, as a private citizen or as a public representative, when the will of one third of a population, who are so concerned they take to the streets about an issue, is completely ignored <Col N="279"/>by their local authority and the Minister in charge.  Deputies on the Government side have appealed to the Minister to take action.  I fail to understand why he cannot.  Ultimately, rerouting will be the cheaper solution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be here to respond to this matter and to give a perspective on a critical project and one that is sensitive to the local community.  The Government, in turn, is sensitive to that, as are all public representatives, who have held discussions, and with the members of the community council, who have had discussions with me regarding the project.</P>
        <P>The interconnector is of critical national infrastructural importance.  It will give us greater security of electricity and lower prices.  It is a critical project and it is in the national interest that it be developed.</P>
        <P>EirGrid, the State owned independent transmission system company is building the interconnector.  It went through the planning process in September 2009, getting full permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Strategic Infrastructure Act.  My Department has no direct role in the planning process.  Formal approval followed a comprehensive assessment process, including an oral hearing at which stakeholders, including Rush Community Council, were present.  I believe EirGrid has engaged extensively with communities along the route, including the local community and public representatives.</P>
        <P>The work starting currently is to put in the piping but not the cable.  I understand that will not start until mid-2011.  The ducting must go in now because other infrastructural works are planned by Fingal County Council for 2011.  The ducting is being combined with other local council works.</P>
        <P>During the planning process, including the oral hearing, the matter of health and safety, and the further concerns of the community council, were covered.  We commissioned Dr. van Rongen, who is recognised as an international expert.  He is a member of the Netherlands Government health council and of the advisory committee of the World Health Organisation international EMF project.  I was pleased to be able to commission him to undertake a review.  That report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which I know the Deputy has seen.</P>
        <P>Further to that, work is ongoing between Rush Community Council and EirGrid on the separate issue of the operational safety of the project.  KEMA consultants are undertaking a report on that, by mutual agreement.</P>
        <P>The planning process has been gone through and time is tight on this very significant &euro;600 million project.  Funding is provided by a very competitive arrangement entered into by EirGrid &mdash; with Government approval &mdash; with the European Investment Bank and a number of major commercial banks.  Funding of &euro;110 million is also being provided by the European Energy Programme for Recovery to assist the project.  The key determinants for the award of funding by the EU Commission were the demonstrable state of readiness of the project and the strategic importance of the interconnector in its own right.</P>
        <P>Having got planning permission, EirGrid was able to place contracts with ABB, the manufacturers of the cable.  As Deputy Reilly intimated, getting the cable is a very difficult process.  There is huge demand, huge back orders and huge timeline constraints.  The securing of planning permission was a condition precedent to the agreement and drawdown of commercial bank and EIB funding.    If we were to re-route, an entirely new planning application would be required, which would take approximately two years to process without any guarantee of success.  This would seriously jeopardise the funding arrangements in place, with real cost implications for Irish electricity consumers.  I understand the European Investment Bank and the European Commission are monitoring the progress of the project.  The prospect of a delay would be received very negatively by those two institutions.  A delay would risk funding and damage the reputation of the country in terms of winning planning permission, given that one <Col N="280"/>organises contract arrangements on the back of such permission.  If the project were not completed, it would call into question Ireland&rsquo;s ability to proceed with similar projects.</P>
        <P>I understand that if the proposed works were delayed beyond November, the cost of the delay would amount to &euro;12 million immediately, with knock-on costs accruing thereafter.  I am told EirGrid estimates that every day&rsquo;s delay would add approximately &euro;100,000 to the cost of the project.  This would be added directly to electricity consumers&rsquo; bills.  Any delay in getting under way with the works would affect other scheduled project works and other infrastructure projects.  It would have a real effect on the ability of the State to deliver a project of considerable importance and with considerable budget implications.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The companies operating are publicly owned companies acting in the public interest and delivering a project that we all regard as beneficial.  I understand the concerns of the local community and its desire for an alternative approach.  In this instance, however, bearing in mind that planning permission has been granted, some of the fundamental concerns over health effects can be answered by the analysis contained in Dr. van Rongen&rsquo;s report.  We could arrange for Dr. van Rongen to answer people&rsquo;s questions in this regard.  I said this to the Deputies previously.</P>
        <P>If we were to delay the project at this stage, it would have considerable knock-on consequences.  I encourage all sides, including EirGrid and the community, to allow for the completion of the safety project.  We can raise further questions on safety in light of Dr. van Rongen&rsquo;s analysis.  He seems to be a man of real international repute.  It is a matter of trying to minimise understandable concern in the community, which is not in anyone&rsquo;s interest.  I ask the local Deputies and Senators to do whatever they can in this regard but I cannot re-route an infrastructure project that is urgent for the State.  It would have considerable financial implications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The renewed Programme for Government  contains commitments to introduce a new system for the financing of local government, ensuring the viability of local services, and that Government policy for the reform of Local Government is implemented.  The Programme further commits to the introduction of charging for treated water use that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied.  </P>
        <P>The revenue base of local authorities was broadened in 2009 by the introduction in the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 of a charge on non-principal private residences.  The charge is payable in respect of private rented accommodation, holiday homes and other non-principal private residences.  As at 22 November 2010, the non-principal private residence charge had raised &euro;66,871,580 in respect of 2009 and &euro;63,252,880 to date in respect of 2010.</P>
        <P>It is intended that volumetric water charges for domestic customers will be introduced from 2014.  The introduction of water charges will be preceded by a programme to install water meters in all houses connected to public water supplies.</P>
        <P>A dedicated Cabinet Committee has been engaged in finalising the policy decisions for inclusion in the White Paper on Local Government.  I intend to publish the White Paper as soon as possible following completion of the Government&rsquo;s deliberations.</P>
        <P>The National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 published by Government yesterday sets out the future initiatives, in the context of the State&rsquo;s overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.  The immediate funding position and associated measures in the period ahead form part of next year&rsquo;s Budget which will be presented by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on 7 December.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The State has a legal obligation under the Habitats Directive and under the Wildlife Acts to protect sites that it has designated for conservation purposes. In Ireland a number of sites have been designated for the protection of raised bog habitat within Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) or Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs). These make up just over 4% of bogland in the State where turf-extraction is feasible. </P>
        <P>Scientific evidence has shown that turf cutting and associated drainage is incompatible with preservation or the restoration of active raised bogs or degraded raised bog.  For this reason, in May 2010, the Government confirmed the ending of the derogation which allowed a 10-year continuation of turf-cutting on raised bog SACs and NHAs.  Cutting is no longer permitted on the first 31 of these sites, without my express consent.  Similar measures will be introduced on a further 24 raised bog SACs from the end of 2011 and on 75 raised bog NHAs in 2013.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to reconsider the ending of the derogation period.  Ireland has a clear legal obligation to protect these sites.  To fail to do so would risk infringement proceedings against the State with possible significant financial sanctions.</P>
        <P>In May 2010, the Government announced the closure of the Bog Purchase Scheme to new applicants but decided to complete purchases for the existing applications, subject to contract.</P>
        <P>An Interim Compensation Scheme was also established to compensate those who have been cutting turf on the 31 raised bogs sites on which cutting is no longer permitted, without my consent.</P>
        <P>The Government also requested my Department and the Office of the Attorney General to undertake further work in regard to how the interests of affected parties can be addressed in the longer term.  This work is ongoing and I intend to revert to Government in relation to these issues shortly</P>

        <Quest> when the incremental purchase scheme will be fully operational; the rationale for the implementation of this scheme and if any modifications of the scheme are under consideration in light of the sustained fall in house prices. </Quest>
        <QRef>[44395/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Regulations to implement the Incremental Purchase Scheme for new homes were made in June 2010.  Housing authorities are making the necessary arrangements to make the scheme fully operational.  </P>
        <P>Meeting the legitimate aspirations of many households for home ownership has traditionally been a key component of housing policy in Ireland.  The Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, emphasised the Government&rsquo;s firm commitment to respond to the needs of households who face difficulty in resourcing home purchase on the open market.  It remains Government policy that low-income earners be afforded the opportunity to purchase homes.</P><Col N="283"/>
        <P>The incremental purchase scheme provides benefits both for the purchaser and the State.  The scheme offers the earliest possible start on the path to home ownership for those willing and able to undertake a house purchase.  It allows social housing tenants and persons who have an assessed housing need avail of attractive discounts, from 40% to 60% of the total cost of the house depending on income, to purchase a new home.  The scheme is also structured to make it attractive for people to put down long-term roots in the community and to commit to an area, thereby contributing to more stable and integrated communities.  For the State the scheme reduces management and maintenance costs and facilitates recycling of capital funding to provide additional social housing.</P>
        <P>In the present constrained environment the demand for tenant purchase is understandably low.  The number of tenant purchase sales has dropped from 1,855 in 2006 to 161 last year.  This will certainly affect the early take up of the Incremental Purchase Scheme, but I expect, as confidence returns, that the scheme will prove an important instrument of housing policy.</P>
        <P>Finally, I wish to refer to the announcement in June 2010 of the intention to replace the existing tenant purchase arrangements with a new scheme based on incremental purchase principles.  This will allow tenants to buy their existing homes as well as giving them the choice to purchase a new local authority dwelling.  This change will require amending legislation.</P>

        <Quest> the preparatory actions he and agencies and organisations under his remit have undertaken in advance of any adverse weather this winter; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment; Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>In keeping with international best practice, Ireland follows a generic approach to emergency management, which is set out in A Framework for Major Emergency Management.  This was approved by Government in May 2006 and details the processes and procedures for managing and co-ordinating preparedness for, and response to,  severe weather emergencies. </P>
        <P>Each principal response agency (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na divisions, Health Service Executive areas and the main local authorities) adopted new format Major Emergency Plans with effect from 30 September 2008, based on a common emergency plan template outlined in the Framework.  Local authorities are the lead agency for co-ordinating response to severe weather emergencies.  Local authority Severe Weather Plans, which are a subset of the Major Emergency Plan, can be activated to co-ordinate the response whether a major emergency is declared or not. During the two severe weather events of last winter, for example, the coordination and inter-agency arrangements set out in the Framework were implemented at local and regional level, as required by local circumstances, without the declaration of a major emergency.</P>
        <P>In the aftermath of last winter the National Steering Group, established to oversee implementation of the Framework for Major Emergency Management  and chaired by my Department, carried out an initial review of the response to the severe weather events and sought the views of participants in the response on matters which could be improved for future such events.  It established that the arrangements set out in the Framework were fit for purpose, and operated satisfactorily where used by local authorities (with their partner agencies) to manage the impact of both the flood and severe cold emergencies.  However, some suggested changes and further development of operational matters are being implemented in association with the Framework&rsquo;s regional structures.</P><Col N="284"/>
        <P>These changes were summarised in a Circular letter to all local authorities earlier this year, and covered the following points:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Clarification regarding early warning for severe weather emergencies;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Enhanced arrangements for provision of information to the public;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Protecting infrastructure;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Liaison with agencies outside of the immediate emergency management framework, including the OPW in relation to high volume pumping.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, the National Roads Authority has significantly enhanced the salt procurement arrangements, to provide additional capacity for extended cold spells.  Local authorities also have set out their priorities for road gritting.  Relevant local authority personnel have attended seminars on the changes and updated arrangements which have been put in place.</P>
        <P>Met Eireann, which operates under the aegis of my Department, provides the Public Service Weather Warnings system for local authorities and other bodies.  Local authorities are provided with information from a number of other systems including the IceCast Road Weather Information System operated by the National Roads Authority in conjunction with Met Eireann, and river and coastal flood warning systems where these are in place.</P>
        <P>The revised severe weather emergency arrangements were activated in a number of parts of the country in face of the recent threat of tidal flooding on the weekend of 7/8 November 2010.</P>

        <Quest> the steps he has taken to implement Directive No. 2002/96/EC which imposes the responsibility for the disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment on the manufacturers of such equipment. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Directive 2002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) required each Member State to introduce measures to provide for producer funded take back of end-of-life WEEE for consumers.  The Waste Management (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Regulations 2005 came into effect on 5 July 2005 and completed the transposition of Directive 2002/96/EC.</P>
        <P>These Regulations were subsequently amended by the Waste Management (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 in order to avail of synergies with implementation of the Batteries Directive on 26 September 2008.  Infringement proceedings, relating to a number of technical issues associated with the implementation of the Directive in Ireland, have been instituted by the European Commission; while the basis for the Commission&rsquo;s concerns on these technical points is contested, I intend to make Regulations addressing the issues involved by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the WEEE Directive, financing the environmentally sound management, including recycling, of waste electrical and electronic equipment is solely a producer responsibility.  Two collective compliance schemes, funded by producers to discharge their responsibilities, are currently operating in Ireland.  These compliance schemes, WEEE Ireland and the European Recycling Platform, are responsible for ensuring that all recovered household WEEE <Col N="285"/>is managed in an environmentally sound manner and for putting in place tracking and auditing systems for materials recovery in line with the requirements of the Directive.</P>
        <P>Retailers are required by law to take back WEEE free of charge on a one-for-one, like-for-like, basis from householders.  Each local authority must also accept household WEEE free of charge at its civic amenity facilities.  Retailers can have their premises designated as &lsquo;WEEE collection points&rsquo; or deposit household WEEE free of charge at the local authority civic amenity facilities.  There are currently in excess of 600 &lsquo;WEEE collection points&rsquo; in Ireland including both retail outlets and civic amenity facilities and retailers are obliged to notify purchasers of these take back arrangements.  Information on the WEEE take back system is available on my Department&rsquo;s web site &mdash; www.environ.ie.</P>
        <P>There has been a very positive response to the scheme in Ireland and in just five years, nearly forty two million units of household WEEE, equating to over one hundred and eighty thousand tonnes of old electrical and electronic equipment, have been safely taken out of circulation and recycled.  The compliance schemes report that circa 9kg per capita of household WEEE is being collected for recycling per annum; this is over double the prescribed 4kg target as set out in the WEEE Directive and indicates that Ireland has had significant success in implementing this Directive.</P>
        <P>The WEEE Monitoring Group, which is made up of representatives from relevant industry and public sector stakeholders, oversees the implementation and operation of the WEEE Directive in Ireland.  My Department continues to work with relevant stakeholders through this Group to ensure that Ireland maintains its strong track record of performance versus our EU targets for WEEE recovery and recycling.</P>

	<P>On foot of a commitment made in the Programme for Government, I initiated a review of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in February 2010.</P>
        <P>Under its terms of reference, the Review Group has been asked to review the legislation governing the EPA; assess performance against its mandate and evaluate the scope of that mandate; review the resources allocated to it; assess the structures and governance of the Agency; and assess the relationship between the Agency and other parts of the environmental governance structure in Ireland. The review group members are drawn from a varied background and include environmental, legal, academic, business and agriculture experts. The group also includes former Directors of the EPA and its Dutch counterpart.</P>
        <P>A public consultation process in relation to the review was held earlier in 2010 and received over 130 submissions. The review group, as part of its ongoing work programme, has also consulted with a wide range of stakeholders including environmental Non-Governmental Organisations, the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, Government Departments and other public bodies, the City and County Managers Association and of course, the EPA itself.</P>
        <P>I expect the Review Group to be in a position substantially to conclude its work early in 2011 and to submit its report quickly thereafter.  I envisage that the report will be published in due course, following consideration of its conclusions and recommendations.</P><Col N="286"/>
        <P>The EPA plays a key role in monitoring, maintaining and improving Ireland&rsquo;s environmental performance and, accordingly, I attach a high level of importance to the review.  Good environmental governance is a key priority for the Government as a whole, in particular as an essential element of sustainable development.  The review is also important in the context of the Transforming Public Services agenda and the need for efficiency and effectiveness in a resource constrained environment.  The ultimate aim of the review is to strengthen the Agency and I look forward to the finalisation of the Review Group&rsquo;s report.  Further details in relation to the review are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.</P>

        <P>As outlined in the Government&rsquo;s National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, it is intended that water charges for domestic customers will be introduced from 2014.  This will be preceded by the rollout of a national metering programme to install meters in all households connected to the public water supply.  The metering programme is likely to take a number of years to be completed but it is intended that it will be substantially complete by 2014.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Department of Finance have been in discussions with the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) regarding the funding of the metering programme.  The NPRF has agreed in principle to fund the programme up to an amount of &euro;550 million subject to normal commercial terms in keeping with its statutory remit.</P>
        <P>The overall cost of the programme, and cost per household, will be dependent on the types of water meters and associated equipment chosen for use and the method of installation to be employed all of which will be subject to a competitive tendering exercise.  My Department is analysing the various options to ensure the delivery of the metering programme in the most cost effective manner.</P>

	<P>Directive 2003/35/EC (&lsquo;the Public Participation Directive&rsquo;) provides for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and for access to justice in certain environmental matters.  It amends both Directive 85/337/EC on Environmental Impact Assessment and Directive 96/61/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC).  The Directive impacts on a range of consent systems including planning and strategic infrastructure, foreshore, aquaculture licensing, forestry, waste licensing and arterial drainage. </P>
        <P>The system of judicial review gives effect to the access to justice requirements of the Directive.  Other forms of redress &mdash; such as appeals against decisions of planning authorities to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and recourse to the Ombudsman where applicable &mdash; also transpose aspects of the Directive.</P>
        <P>A wide range of legislation, affecting a number of Departments, was used to transpose the Directive.  However, following a judgment of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) against Ireland in July 2009, it became apparent that further legislative amendments were necessary in order to complete transposition.</P>
        <P>The most recent of these include:</P><Col N="289"/>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the question refers to Directive No. 2000/53/EC on end-of life vehicles (ELVs) which sets out the specific measures to be put in place by EU Member States in relation to the collection, storage, treatment, dismantling, reuse and recycling of end-of-life vehicles.  </P>
        <P>Under the Directive, each Member State is required, inter alia, to ensure that all end-of-life vehicles are dismantled, treated and recovered at no cost to the final holder/owner of that vehicle and in a manner that does not cause environmental pollution.</P>
        <P>The Waste Management (End-of-Life Vehicles) Regulations 2006 provide the regulatory framework for the implementation of this Directive in Ireland.  Under the Regulations, a wide range of obligations are imposed on vehicle producers (manufacturers and professional importers), authorised treatment facilities, vehicle owners and local authorities.</P>
        <P>Producers are required to establish national collection systems for the appropriate treatment and recovery of end-of-life vehicles of their particular brands.  As a minimum and in accordance with the proximity principle, each producer&rsquo;s national collection system is required to have at least one authorised treatment facility in each city and county council area that will provide <Col N="291"/>free take-back for vehicles of that producer&rsquo;s brand.  In counties and cities with a larger population base, producers are required to have one extra facility for each additional 150,000 persons in the relevant county or city area.  Producers must also register with each local authority, pay a registration fee and provide specified information to each local authority under the registration process.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are responsible for the enforcement of the Regulations in their functional areas as well as the issuing of waste facility permits for authorised treatment facilities.</P>
        <P>Since 1 January 2007, a statutory obligation has been imposed on the owner or operator of each authorised treatment facility to issue a certificate of destruction to the registered owner of an end-of-life vehicle at the time of the deposit of that vehicle at the facility concerned for appropriate treatment and recovery.</P>
        <P>Directive 2000/53/EC sets reuse/recovery and reuse/recycling rates of 85% and 80%, respectively, to be achieved by 1 January 2006. The latest data available are in respect of 2008 and indicate that an estimated 127,612 end-of-life vehicles were treated by authorised treatment facilities in Ireland, yielding an overall reuse/recovery rate of 81.80% and an overall reuse/recycling rate of 75.88%. My Department will continue to engage with key stakeholders, and in particular with the motor vehicle industry producers, with a view to addressing this issue and ensuring that we take the necessary steps to meet the EU targets without delay.</P>

        <P>Planning authorities are of course independent statutory bodies, with democratically elected councils and their own management structures to carry out their statutory duties.  Under planning legislation, planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in making decisions on planning applications, must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by the Department.  My Department has issued a large number of statutory planning guidelines to planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in order to improve the quality of, and promote consistency in, decisions on planning applications.</P>
        <P>The fact that the Board may make a different decision to a planning authority in a particular case is not necessarily an indication that the planning authority decision is incorrect.  Planning decisions are based on a balanced judgment of a wide range of policies &mdash; economic, environmental and social.

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Directive 2000/60/EC, the Water Framework Directive, provides a comprehensive basis for the protection and improvement of inland surface waters, groundwater and transitional and coastal waters.  The Directive requires that Member States take a catchment-based approach to the protection of waters by establishing river basin districts and management plans for these districts.</P>
        <P>In July 2010 I approved river basin management plans for each of our seven river basin districts.  The plans set out the current  status of our waters, the environmental objectives to be achieved and the measures to be implemented in order to achieve those objectives.  They cover all of the waters in the country, numbering approximately 5,000 surface water and 800 groundwater bodies.</P>
        <P>The plans aim to increase the proportion of rivers and canals at good or high status from 54% currently to 68% by 2015 and the proportion of lakes at good or high status from 65% currently to 84% by 2015.  These would represent significant improvements in water quality and the process of improvement will continue into subsequent planning cycles.</P>
        <P>The measures to protect and improve waters require an appropriate legal base and since 2007, I have significantly strengthened the legislative framework for the protection of waters.  New regulations, the Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations, were introduced in 2007 requiring local authorities to obtain discharge licences from the EPA for wastewater treatment plants.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Surface Waters) Regulations were introduced, establishing environmental quality standards and giving further effect to the Water Framework Directive.  Earlier in 2010 I introduced complementary legislation in relation to groundwater.</P>
        <P>The most recent Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 also reflects the priority which I have given to the protection and improvement of our waters, both in terms of the continued high level of investment and the alignment of the programme with the environmental priorities identified in the river basin management plans.</P>
        <P>The challenge now will be to ensure that the objectives of the river basin management plans are realised.  This will require, <i>inter alia, </i>   a review of the current administrative structures in the context of implementing the recommendations of the report of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group which recognised the potential for strengthening the delivery approach at regional level, building on existing shared services arrangements.</P>

	<P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been licensing certain large-scale industrial and agriculture activities progressively since 1994.  Originally the licensing system was known as Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) licensing, governed by the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  The Act was amended by the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 which gave effect to Council Directive 96/61/EC concerning Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC).</P>

The EPA has taken significant steps to bring these sectors into full compliance and continues to take such action as is necessary in order to require all relevant installations to hold an IPPC permit.</P>
        <P>The IPPC licensing system administered by the EPA is generally acknowledged to have secured substantial improvements in the environmental performance of the industrial and other activities covered by the IPPC Directive, for example, reduced emissions to air and water; energy savings; moves to more environmentally friendly processes; and lower noise emissions.</P>

	<P>Directive 80/68/EEC was given legal effect through the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related regulations.  The effect of this legislation is that discharges of certain dangerous substances to groundwater are subject to prior authorisation by way of a licence from the relevant local authority.  </P><Col N="295"/>
        <P>The scope of the Directive is somewhat limited and it is due to be repealed in December 2013.  The Water Framework Directive and a new Groundwater Directive (adopted by the EU in 2006), provide a broader, strengthened basis for the protection of groundwater.</P>
        <P>Earlier in 2010, I introduced the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations 2010 to give legal effect to the new Groundwater Directive.  These Regulations strengthen the existing regime for the protection of groundwater and establish clear environmental objectives to be achieved in groundwater bodies within specified timeframes.  Furthermore, they impose a duty on public authorities to implement measures aimed at achieving such objectives, including a review of authorisations to discharge to groundwater, to be completed by 22 December 2012.</P>

	<P>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</P>
        <P>However, I have urged local authorities to exercise restraint in setting the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) in this and previous years and they have responded positively in this regard.  Across the 88 local authorities the average change of ARV from 2009 to 2010 shows a decrease of 0.62%.  As part of a range of measures to aid economic recovery, I am clear on the need for continued reductions in commercial rates over the coming years.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 45 and 50 together.</P>
        <P>Sections 34(4)(g) and 180(2)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provide respectively that a planning authority may attach conditions to a planning permission requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of a proposed development and, if a development is not subsequently completed satisfactorily, apply a security given under section 34 for the satisfactory completion of that development.</P>
        <P>My Department has consistently advised planning authorities that it is essential that planning permissions for residential developments are subject to conditions under which an acceptable security is provided by way of bond, cash deposit or otherwise so as to secure the satisfactory completion of those developments.  This advice was repeated in my Department&rsquo;s Development Management Guidelines of June 2007 and policy guidance on the Taking in Charge of Residential Developments of February 2008 which state that, in the case of residential development, planning conditions must require the giving of sufficient security prior to commencement of development and that planning authorities must ensure that they are in a position to draw down the security in cases where a developer fails satisfactorily to complete a residential development, or phase of a development, within the specified period.</P>
        <P>The Guidance states that it is a matter for the planning authority to determine both the level of the security and the type of security (e.g. the lodgment of a bond from a financial institution such as a bank, insurance company or building society, a cash lodgment or a letter of guarantee from the Construction Industry Federation) that will be required for each residential development, but that the amount of the security, and the terms on which it is required to be given, must enable the planning authority, without cost to itself, to complete the necessary services (including roads, footpaths, water mains, sewers, lighting and open space) to a satisfactory standard in the event of default by the developer.  The Guidance also states that planning authorities must ensure, when using time-limited bonds, that the bond is of sufficient duration to allow them time to inspect the development after the expiration of permission and still call in the bond if necessary, and recommends that the duration of the planning permission (and any approved extension of that duration) plus 2 years should be minimum duration for a bond.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Guidance advises that a security condition must also provide for the recalculation of the amount specified in the condition by reference to the House Building Cost Index (or the Consumer Price Index) if the development to which the permission relates is not commenced within a specified period after the granting of the permission.</P>
        <P>In relation to the matter of phasing of development, Circular Letter PD 1/08 states that planning authorities should consider whether it is appropriate to attach a condition regarding the phasing of a residential development in order to ensure that residents do not have to live in uncompleted residential developments for lengthy periods.  It pointed out that a phasing <Col N="297"/>condition could include requirements relating to the completion of roads, public lighting, open spaces, etc. which are necessary for, or ancillary to, the completed units in each phase.   Such an arrangement would permit the security for satisfactory completion to be related to a particular phase or phases of the development and thus enable completion of sections of the scheme to be advanced while, at the same time, facilitating the developer by obviating the need for a very large security appropriate to the entire development.</P>
        <P>The high-level Expert Group on Unfinished Housing Developments is actively developing practical and policy solutions to effectively address unfinished housing developments, including preparation of a guidance manual and Code of Practice and the identification of appropriate legislative reforms to ensure the satisfactory resolution of issues associated with unfinished estates.  I expect the Expert Group to report back early in 2011.</P>
        <P>I have not received any specific requests from local authorities for funding to address issues in relation to incomplete estates where adequacy of bonds is of concern.</P>

	<P>During 2007, water services authorities were asked by my Department to review the operation of all water treatment plants (and associated infrastructure) and to ensure that the installation of continuous chlorine alarms and turbidity meters at appropriate locations at the treatment plant or in the distribution network (including at reservoirs) was progressed without delay. This request was restated in August 2008 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) who issued a circular to water services authorities recommending the installation of a chlorine monitor and alarm in each public water supply. I understand that the installation of this equipment on public water supplies is substantially completed.</P>
        <P>Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No.2) Regulations 2007, the EPA is responsible for the supervision of public water supplies.  The Regulations provide that the EPA can issue such directions to the water services authorities (the 34 county and city councils) as it considers necessary to achieve compliance with the standards provided for in the Regulations and that failure to comply with such a direction by the Agency is an offence.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As suggested in the Oireachtas Joint Committee&rsquo;s report, I have asked my Department to complete its own review of the severe weather events as soon as possible.  This report, which is close to finalisation, draws on information provided to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and addresses a wide range of issues emerging from the co-ordination of response to the two extreme weather events.</P>
        <P>It deals with issues that fall within my Department&rsquo;s areas of responsibility, including undertaking the role as the Lead Government Department for co-ordination of response to severe weather emergencies at National level.   It also looks, inter alia, at the linkages under the Framework for Emergency Management between the front-line response and coordination at central Government level, and seeks to provide necessary recommendations to improve national co-ordination and responses to such emergencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Oireachtas Joint Committee made recommendations on a range of issues, including some which fall outside my areas of responsibility, such as the role of the Office of Public Works in relation flood mitigation, and to the role of the ESB in hydro-electric power production.  The Joint Committee&rsquo;s report has placed relevant information on the public record, and it is not my role to establish an inquiry into these matters.   Necessary reviews were undertaken in relation to my area of responsibility, particularly on the lessons learned in relation to the emergency response, and appropriate actions have been taken. These include the development of an interim protocol between the relevant local authorities concerned with the River Lee and the ESB for sharing information and enhancing flood warnings, pending the development of flood forecasting and warning systems as part of the OPW&rsquo;s flood mitigation programmes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The majority of Exchequer investment in water services infrastructure is provided to local authorities under the water services investment programme which is a rolling multi-annual programme.   These programmes are developed, generally on a triennial basis, following an assessment of needs for water and waste water services conducted by each water services authority.  In preparing these assessments, water services authorities are required to take into consideration key environmental and economic criteria in prioritising contracts and schemes to be progressed in their areas.  The most recent assessment of need was conducted in 2009 and I published the &ldquo;Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012&rdquo; in April 2010.  The programme details, by location, just over 130 contracts and water conservation projects in progress at the time of publication at a value of some &euro;1 billion and a further 340 contracts to be progressed to construction over the period of the programme with a value of &euro;1.8 billion.    A copy of the Programme is available in the Oireachtas Library.   This programme succeeded the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009, under which some 125 major water services contracts/schemes were completed.  Details of these completions by location are set out in Appendix 1 of the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012.  </P>
        <P>The scope and format of the Programme for 2010 to 2012 is designed better to reflect ongoing environmental and economic priorities, to maximise the return on public funds being invested in the sector and to ensure that the Programme is realistic in its level of ambition.   The development of this Programme involved a comprehensive review of all schemes which had not substantially advanced under its predecessor to ensure that those progressing would meet the programme priorities for the period ahead.</P>
        <P>The contracts and schemes not included in the Programme  on this occasion were those which did not feature highly on public health grounds or other environmental compliance requirements (for example those relating to European Court of Justice proceedings, or those required in the context of the River Basin Management Plans, Shellfish Pollution Production Programmes, EPA reports etc) and projects that were proposed simply for capacity expansion (which was unrelated to the National Spatial Strategy/developing areas priorities), and which in the case of water supply can be deferred, in many cases, in favour of accelerated water conservation measures.   Around 135 contracts and 250 schemes were not included in the Programme for this reason, but in some instances these proposals related to further phases of contracts or schemes which are included in the Programme.</P>
        <P>Following inclusion in the Water Services Investment Programme, my Department&rsquo;s involvement at individual stages of schemes can vary from two to four occasions depending on the value of the scheme.  My Department approves the local authority&rsquo;s Design Brief and Preliminary Report for all schemes and in some instances it also approves the Contract Documents.  In the case of Public Private Partnership contracts the Department, additionally, approves the local authority&rsquo;s Tender Recommendation. In all cases, authorities are required to seek confirmation of Departmental funding before signing contracts. The involvement of my Department at key stages is necessary to comply with the Department of Finance&rsquo;s Capital Appraisal Guidelines and my Department&rsquo;s obligations relating to management and oversight of Exchequer expenditure.</P><Col N="301"/>
        <P>Funding for small public water and sewerage schemes and group water schemes is available to water services authorities under the Rural Water Programme.  Responsibility for the examination, approval and funding of proposals for group water and sewerage schemes and for small public water and sewerage schemes has been devolved to local authorities under the Rural Water Programme since 1997.    Allocations have also been made under the Rural Water Programme for small works to public water supplies which appear on the EPA&rsquo;s Remedial Action List because such works are necessary to address risks to the supply.  Information on the progression of schemes under the Rural Water Programme may be obtained from the local authorities.  Proposals for allocations under this Programme are submitted by authorities based on priorities set by my Department, in light of public health, environmental, and economic objectives and I have no plans to alter these devolved arrangements.</P>
        <P>The 2010 Estimates provision for water services infrastructure is &euro;508 million, of which &euro;415 million is available under the Water Services Investment Programme and &euro;93 million under the Rural Water Programme.  Estimates for 2011 will be announced in due course.</P>

        <Quest> the reason a proposal by a town council to implement a rates waiver scheme under section 2 of the Local Government Rates Act 1970 was rejected by him. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Question refers to the recent application from Carrick-on-Suir Town Council to introduce a rates waiver scheme for new businesses.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for the waiver by the authority of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property.  The making of such a scheme is subject to the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Any application received for a rate waiver scheme is carefully considered.  However, in considering any such application, it has to be borne in mind that a waiver of rates for one class of ratepayer could unfairly impact on existing businesses in the area by giving a competitive advantage to a certain group through a reduction in costs.  In addition, the introduction of a waiver scheme could further increase costs on the part of businesses who are not part of the scheme, as it is likely that they would be required to make up the cost of the waiver scheme through the payment of additional rates.  This could impose an additional burden in what are already difficult economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>I took these factors into consideration in making my decision not to consent to the proposed waiver scheme in this case.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the adopt-a-highway and adopt-a-road schemes which are in operation in other countries; similar schemes are also in place in certain local authority areas in this country.</P>
        <P>Under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009 it is the function of local authorities to provide the primary response to littering.  My Department&rsquo;s role is to provide the legislative framework for combating litter pollution, and to motivate and energise anti-litter responses as necessary.  It is the responsibility of each local authority to determine the most appropriate course of action to tackle litter pollution within the relevant legislation.</P>
        <P>The Anti-Litter Awareness Grant Scheme, which is administered by my Department, allows local authorities the opportunity to apply for grant funding for suitable projects such as adopt-a-road. It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the projects they wish to propose for funding.  This year I have allocated a total of &euro;1.6 million in grant assistance and a number of adopt-a-road projects proposed by local authorities are receiving support in that context.</P>

Where a child with special educational needs is in receipt of additional supports in a school and moves school, and no other child with special needs enrols in the school, then the resource &mdash; resource teaching hours and/or SNA support &mdash; is withdrawn from the first school and, if still warranted by the child&rsquo;s needs, will be sanctioned for the new school.</P>
        <P>In considering applications for teaching and SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the needs identified in the professional report and decide whether the circumstances come within the Department&rsquo;s criteria.  They then consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupil from its current level of resources.</P>
        <P>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</P>
        <P>I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the General Allocation Model (GAM) was introduced in primary schools in September 2005 to ensure that each school has learning support/resource teaching support available to meet the needs of children with high incidence special educational needs.  In general, where a school meets the criteria for developing school status as outlined in the staffing schedule for the appointment of teachers for the current school year (Department Circular 0021/2010), an appropriate adjustment will automatically be made to the school&rsquo;s allocation under the GAM.</P>
        <P>When the GAM commenced, a commitment was given to carry out a review after three years of operation.  This review commenced in 2008.  The process involved engaging with the Education Partners which includes parent, management and union interests in the context of securing their views on the model&rsquo;s operation.  The review is at an advanced stage and is currently being considered within my Department.</P>
        <P>Any decision in relation to the operation of the model will be taken in the context of the outcome of the review, the resources available and the competing demands for resources generally in the education system.</P>

	<P>The criteria for participating in the F&Aacute;S Community Employment Scheme (CE) are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments, and are as follows: Part-time <Col N="309"/>Integration Option (PTI) This is a one year version of CE for people aged 25 years and over who are receiving social welfare payments for 12 months or more. Part-time Job Option (PTJ) This is a three year version of CE, (based on annually renewable contracts) for people aged 35 years and over and who are receiving social welfare payments for 3 years or more.</P>
        <P>The social welfare payments referred to above are:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Jobseekers Benefit (JB);</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit (DWB);</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Farm Assist (FA).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Time spent in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance can also count towards the 12-month eligibility period (3 years for PTJ), but caring responsibilities must have ceased and the person must currently be in receipt of either JA, JB or OPFP.</P>
        <P>The following persons are also eligible for participation on CE:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />People aged 18 years or over (35 years or over for PTJ) and who are currently in receipt of any of Disability Allowance, Blind Pension, Invalidity Pension and Illness Benefit for six months or more;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Persons from the Travelling Community aged 18 years or over, who are unemployed and in receipt of Jobseekers Benefit, Jobseekers Allowance for any period (12 months for PTJ) or One Parent Family Payment for 1 year or longer.  In the case of those under 18 years of age, a minimum of 12 months spent in a Travellers Training Centre is enough for eligibility;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />All refugees aged 18 years or over, as authenticated by the Department of Justice and Law Reform, in receipt of payments from the Department of Social Protection;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Persons aged 18 years or over inhabiting the offshore islands;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Ex-offenders aged 18 years or over (35 years or over for PTJ) and referred by the Probation Service.  Also, Ex-offenders aged 18 and over (35 years or over for PTJ) and not referred by the Probation Service and in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance or Jobseekers Benefit for a period of one year or more (3 years for PTJ).  Time spent as a prisoner is regarded as reckonable when considering the duration unemployed;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Time spent on recognised training or employment programmes (such as a F&Aacute;S training course) can also be counted towards eligibility.  Eligibility to participate on CE for both PTI and PTJ is linked to those in receipt of an Irish social welfare payment.  Those persons not meeting the criteria under these options, or who are signing for credits, or receiving social welfare benefits from a different country, are not eligible to participate on CE.</P><Col N="310"/>

<P el="3"><Miles com="bull66" />individual needs assessment;</P>
<P el="3"><Miles com="bull66" />vocational profiling and career planning;</P>
<P el="3"><Miles com="bull66" />individual employment plan;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">Participants can avail of the programme for up to 18 months duration.  The programme is delivered on behalf of F&Aacute;S by 23 local supported employment organisations.</P>
        <P>The workplace element of the service provides a period of 5 to 7 weeks work experience.  The participants retain their normal social welfare status and entitlements and they engage in normal work during this time.  The participant receives a flat rate of &euro;31.80 per week towards travel and meal expenses.   This will be paid by the employer and reimbursed, in arrears, by F&Aacute;S.  F&Aacute;S is responsible for employer&rsquo;s liability insurance.</P>
        <P>In June 2010 there were 2,563 people participating in the Supported Employment Programme of which 202 were on work experience under the Workplace initiative and a further 812 in employment in the open labour market.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Community Employment</i></P>
        <P el="0">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful part-time work within their communities on a temporary, fixed-term basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills.  The average hours per week are 19.5hrs or 39 hours per fortnight.  There are currently 22,850 participants on the CE programme.  The criteria for participating in the F&Aacute;S Community Employment Scheme (CE) are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments, and are as follows:</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Part-time Integration Option (PTI)</i></P>
<P el="0">This is a one year version of CE for people aged 25 years and over who are receiving social welfare payments for 12 months or more.</P>
         <P el="10"><i>Part-time Job Option (PTJ)</i></P>
<P el="0">This is a three year version of CE, (based on annually renewable contracts) for people aged 35 years and over and who are receiving social welfare payments for 3 years or more.</P>
        <P>Eligibility to participate on CE for both PTI and PTJ is linked to those in receipt of an Irish social welfare payment.  Those persons not meeting the criteria under these options, or who are signing for credits, or receiving social welfare benefits from a different country, are not eligible to participate on CE.</P>
        <P>In assessing eligibility for CE, recipients of JA or JB are allowed a maximum of 30 worked days in the 12 months prior to commencing.</P>
        <P>From 3 April 2000, lifetime participation on CE by an individual will be limited to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />3 years (156 weeks) for persons under 55 years of age;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />6 years (312 weeks) for persons of 55 years of age up to and including 65 years of age;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Eligible persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-linked Social Welfare payment will be eligible for one additional year on CE over the standard maximum participation caps, i.e. 4 years maximum time on CE for those under 55 years of age (PTJ Option only), and 7 years maximum time for those between 55 and 65.</P><Col N="314"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Participation on CE prior to 3 April 2000 is not counted.  Offshore island residents are exempt from this participation cap, subject to the availability of places.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Job Initiative</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Job Initiative (JI) programme was launched in July 1996 and continues to provide full-time employment for people who are 35 years of age or over, who were unemployed for five years or more, and in receipt of social welfare payments over that qualifying period before entering the programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The main purpose of JI is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities.  F&Aacute;S operates the programme with a dedicated budget of &euro;34.5 million for 2010. There are currently 1,300 participants, with this number decreasing annually due to retirement and other reasons. Following changes introduced in 2004 by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, contracts for existing JI participants are renewed, allowing them the option to continue until they are 66 years of age.  There is no recruitment to the programme due to this change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">JI participants are involved in a wide range of useful community services, including after-school care, breakfast clubs, homework clubs, gardening and security services. In addition, JI projects provide jobs in the social economy in administration and maintenance.  The areas supported by these workers include community centres, cr&egrave;ches, enterprise centres and parish properties.</P>

	<P>The majority of Community Employment (CE) Schemes funded by F&Aacute;S are operated by companies limited by guarantee.  The companies, which are called sponsors, are formed by community groups &lsquo;incorporating&rsquo; to comply with F&Aacute;S contractual guidelines for operating CE schemes.  The remainder are generally made up of public bodies such as County Councils.  The sponsor is the employer and is responsible for the recruitment of both participants and supervisors. </P>
        <P>In addition to being advertised in local F&Aacute;S offices, all CE vacancies are notified to F&Aacute;S and appear centrally on the Jobs Ireland website.  F&Aacute;S can advise clients on the suitability of the CE programme in meeting their needs, and also confirm a client&rsquo;s eligibility and entitlements.  It is the sponsor who will interview potential participants and make the final decision on recruitment.  Generally, all schemes are run by separate organisations and legal entities.</P>
        <P>There is no entitlement to participate on CE.  Eligibility is determined by F&Aacute;S using the criteria set out in the guidelines, and suitability for the position, is determined by the prospective employer.  If a client is considered &ldquo;job-ready&rdquo;, they may be referred to other more suitable interventions rather than CE.</P><Col N="315"/>
        <P>F&Aacute;S welcomes proposals from local sponsors to carry out projects, and all proposals are considered within allocated budgets and participant numbers.  The provision of places is managed through a standardised application process between regional F&Aacute;S offices and local sponsor and community organisations, and any issues regarding the allocation of places are dealt with in this context.</P>
        <P>In delivering these places, F&Aacute;S operates flexibly in the management of this allocation in order to maximise progression to the labour market, while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Based on the expenditure information for the period to end October 2010, it is estimated that current expenditure for my Department for the year will be in accordance with the Voted Allocation. It is possible as the end of the year approaches that excesses of expenditure on a small number of subheads will require to be offset by savings on other subheads. There is currently in this regard a projected excess of &euro;43 million on expenditure on Student Supports (Subhead E1), due in large part to a signficant increase in numbers of grant-holders and of numbers in receipt of higher rates of grant. This projected excess will be offset by lower expenditure on Residential Institutions Redress (Subhead B12 &mdash; &euro;10 million), anticipated savings linked to the timescale for payments being made by the Commission on Child Abuse (Subhead B19 &mdash; &euro;12 million) and by various savings on staff costs and on FAS Programmes (&euro;21 million).</P>
        <P>In relation to Capital expenditure, there are indications of a potential under-spend of &euro;62 million on the Primary subhead F1.  Prominent factors in the potential under-spend include the continuing reduction in the value of tenders (40% lower than in the height of the construction boom) and financial difficulties within the sector which have delayed project delivery. It is proposed to reallocate this projected under-spend by increasing by &euro;20 million the allocation for Schools Information and Communication TechnologIes (Subhead B18) and by transferring &euro;42 million to the higher education capital programme (Subhead F3).</P>
        <P>In order to facilitate the above current and capital transfers I will be seeking a technical Supplementary Estimate for my Department.</P>

	<P>Overall there are a range of foreign languages available on the curriculum in schools -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Arabic. A post Primary Languages Initiative is in place since 2000 with the objective of diversifying language provision in schools, focusing particularly on Spanish, Italian, Japanese and Russian.</P>
        <P>Experience to date has been that while students appreciate the opportunity to learn new languages, and are making good progress, the overall take-up remains low, and it is extremely difficult to develop a capacity and cadre of teachers within the existing system who are capable of teaching the new languages. For example, Japanese continues to be provided through the provision of &ldquo;bought in&rdquo; additional services provided by Japanese language assistants. Although third level programmes offering degrees in Japanese are being provided, it has not resulted in qualified teachers of Japanese gaining employment in schools, or in schools prioritising Japanese as a subject within their approved quota of teaching resources.</P>
        <P>Post graduate and honours degree level programmes in Chinese are offered in University College Cork, and honours degree level programmes are provided in University College Dublin, Dublin City University and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The Institutes for <Col N="317"/>Chinese Studies in University College Dublin and in University College Cork both offer programmes in Chinese in partnership with the Confucius Institute. These colleges also offer tuition on an outreach basis to schools in their locality. The feedback from this initiative is very positive. My Department will continue to work closely with the colleges and the Confucius Institutes to support and progress this initiative, to the extent that the funding from the Confucius Institutes will allow.</P>
        <P>The Government is prioritising an agenda of curriculum reform in science and maths and improving innovation capacity in second level schools. The funds currently available in this difficult budgetary context do not allow for the inclusion of additional languages in the curriculum at present. However, I will keep the matter under review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The objective identified by the Forum is essentially about the need to ensure that the Irish school system is subjected to evaluation so that performance across disciplines can be assessed, learning outcomes are identified and that this information is available nationally and at school level to relevant stakeholders. </P>
        <P>This is important not just as an exercise in itself. It is about having quality assurance measures support an agenda of seeking continued improvement.</P>
        <P>In support of this objective the Department conducts its own external evaluation of schools that involves at school level whole school evaluation, inspection of particular disciplines (subject inspection) and incidental visits along with thematic inspections that involve a cross school or sectoral approach. As recently as this week a report based on an aggregation of data from incidental inspections over the past year has provided insightful information on literacy and numeracy in primary schools. This report has been  published.</P>
        <P>School self evaluation is also critical to supporting an agenda of improvement.  The Department&rsquo;s models for school self evaluation clearly identify the need for self evaluation to operate not just at a general level but at subject/discipline level. Again the central purpose at all times must be to inform what needs to be done to improve performance.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. The Registrar of Credit Unions is responsible for administering the system of regulation and supervision of credit unions provided under the Credit Union Act 1997, with a view to the protection by each credit union of the funds of its members and the maintenance of the financial stability of credit unions generally.   Following the Government&rsquo;s decision in September 2008 on the extension and increase in protection available under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme, all credit union savers can be reassured that their deposits and shares to the total maximum value of &euro;100,000 are safe and secure. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy will recognise, the current serious difficulties in the financial sector overall and the accompanying economic downturn is affecting all financial institutions, including credit unions.  There has also been an increase in bad and doubtful debts, as is the case across the whole of the financial sector. Credit union investment portfolios are also being impacted and losses are arising on certain credit union investments.  It is not surprising that this combination of trends has led to a situation where credit unions generally have reported a decline in surpluses in the last two years.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the Registrar of Credit Unions is dealing with specific difficulties in a number of credit unions.  The Registrar is continuing to work closely with the Boards of those credit unions that are encountering problems. Oversight, monitoring and controls over these credit unions by the Registrar of Credit Unions are intended to assist them in addressing current issues with a view to ensuring their financial stability.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that under section 139(6) of the Finance Act 1992 a vehicle in respect of which certain offences are committed is subject to forfeiture.  Those offences are prescribed in section 139(3) and section 139(5) of that Act.   Section 139(3) of that Act deems it to be an offence for a person, in respect of a vehicle in the State&mdash;</P>
        <P el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>to be in possession of the vehicle if it is unregistered, unless he or she is an authorised person or the vehicle is the subject of an exemption under section 135 of that Act for the time being in force and the vehicle is being used in accordance with any conditions, restrictions or limitations referred to in that section,</P>
       <P el="5">(b) <?oasys _ix ?>if the vehicle is the subject of an exemption under section 134 of that Act, to be in possession of the vehicle other than in accordance with any conditions, restrictions or limitations referred to in that section,</P>

         <P el="5">(d) <?oasys _ix ?>to fail to pay any vehicle registration tax due by him/her,</P>
         <P el="5">(e) <?oasys _ix ?>if the vehicle is an unregistered vehicle or a converted vehicle, to fail to account for it in accordance with section 137 of that Act,</P>
        <P el="5">(f) <?oasys _ix ?>to be in possession of the vehicle if it is a converted vehicle in relation to which particulars of the conversion have not been declared in accordance with section 131 of that Act, or a converted vehicle in relation to which particulars of the conversion have been so declared but vehicle registration tax has not been paid on the declaration, unless he is an authorised person, or</P>
       <P el="5">(g) <?oasys _ix ?>if the vehicle is an unregistered vehicle or a converted vehicle in relation to which particulars of the conversion have not been declared in accordance with section 131 of that Act, or a converted vehicle in relation to which particulars of the conversion have been so declared but vehicle registration tax has not been paid on the declaration, to deliver the vehicle to a person other than an authorised person.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Section 139(5) of the Finance Act 1992 provides that if any person is knowingly concerned in the evasion or the taking of steps for the purposes of the evasion, whether by himself/herself or by another, of vehicle registration tax, he or she shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable&mdash;</P>
       <P el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>on summary conviction, to a penalty under the law relating to excise of &euro;5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both, or</P>
     <P el="5">(b) <?oasys _ix ?>on conviction on indictment, to a penalty, under the law relating to excise, of three times the amount of the vehicle registration tax concerned or &euro;12,695, whichever is the greater, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both.</P><Col N="320"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Without knowing the specific details of any single vehicle that might have been liable to forfeiture, it is not possible to be specific as to which of the provisions under section 139(3) or (5) of the Finance Act 1992, the vehicle became liable to forfeiture. However, it should be noted that a vehicle that is legitimately registered outside the State may still be liable to forfeiture if it is the subject of one of the offences provided for under section 139 of that Act while in the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may wish to note that the supervision and oversight of liquidity requirements for credit institutions is a regulatory matter for the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Central Bank of Ireland is subject to strict confidentiality requirements under the EU Supervisory Directives and consequently does not share information on specific regulatory issues with my Department unless the issue gives rise, for example, to some broader financial stability issue in respect of which the Minister should be informed.  These circumstances did not arise in this instance.  However, in response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question my Department has been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that an overnight liquidity breach was reported by an institution at the time referred to in the reports enclosed with the Deputy&rsquo;s question. The Central Bank followed up on this liquidity breach with the institution, which rectified the position to the satisfaction of the Central Bank at the time.  The Central Bank also required an external review of liquidity reports submitted to it <Col N="321"/>and the related control environment. This review did not identify material issues relating to breaches of the required liquidity ratios, other than on the date highlighted by the institution.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank imposes liquidity risk management requirements on all credit institutions. These are set out in &lsquo;Requirements for the Management of Liquidity Risk,&rsquo; which are available to download from www.financialregulator.ie  . Compliance with these requirements is monitored by a combination of on-site and off-site review and inspections.  All credit institutions are required to complete an annual internal audit review and submit this report to the Central Bank on compliance with the Requirements. In addition, Section 47 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, provides that where a credit institution&rsquo;s external auditor has reason to believe there are material defects in the financial systems and controls or accounting records of an institution or has reason to believe that there are material inaccuracies in or omissions from any returns of a financial nature submitted to the Central Bank, they are required to notify the Central Bank without delay.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank of Ireland has confirmed that this matter has now been fully investigated and the Central Bank is satisfied that all liquidity risk management requirements have been complied with and appropriate steps necessary to prevent any recurrence of this issue have now been taken by the institution concerned.</P>

	<P Just="Left">All deposits in Irish banks, building societies and credit unions of up to &euro;100,000 per person are covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme which is a European standard. This is not subject to an end date and continues indefinitely.    In addition, under the Credit Institutions (Extended Liabilities Scheme) 2009 (ELG), demand deposits in excess of &euro;100,000 are covered until 30 June 2011. Amounts deposited for a fixed-term with a bank between when it signed up to the ELG (see table) and 30th June 2011 are covered until maturity up to a maximum of 5 years. The Government is seeking an extension of the ELG until end of December 2011.</P>
        <P>The Irish banking system retains the support, not only of the Central Bank of Ireland, but of the European institutions.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the external assistance by our European partners and the International Monetary Fund is to provide stability and confidence. Measures aimed at underpinning the stability of the banks provide the necessary assurance to depositors and investors that their funds are fully secure.</P>

A further &euro;0.775m arises because of additional receipts under the Bank Guarantee Scheme over and above those projected at the time of the Budget.

    <entry>The primary saving on Vote 10 in 2010 relates to Subhead H2 Flood Risk Management.  This was due to the delay in commencement of construction works on a number of flood relief schemes. In addition, a number of tender prices for major contracts were lower than anticipated.An application to carry forward &euro;5m savings to the 2011 Estimate under the Deferred Surrender Scheme has been provisionally approved by the Department of Finance.</entry>

	<P>The main aim of public procurement policy is to ensure that all public sector purchasing is carried out in a manner that is legal, transparent, and secures optimal value for money for the taxpayer.  Within this context, the policy approach allows for the promotion of wider Government objectives, where appropriate, such as facilitating small and medium-sized enterprises, or the promotion of social or environmental objectives.   I understand that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is at an advanced stage in the development of a National Action Plan on Green Procurement, which follows on from policy initiatives in this regard at EU level.  That Plan, which is being prepared in consultation with my Department and the National Procurement Service (NPS) within the Office of Public Works, will address the sustainability matters referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Freedom of Information Act in the UK requires public authorities to have an approved publication scheme in place which is a means of providing access to information which an authority proactively publishes.  This scheme covers amongst other things financial information relating to projected and actual income and expenditure, tendering, procurement and contracts.   In Ireland aggregate expenditure information for each Department is published each month, broken down by current and capital spending, to show the level of Exchequer funding actually drawn down, as against the profiled amount of expenditure for each month as published earlier in the year.</P>
        <P>As regards transparency and competition, my Department has set up a website www.etenders.gov.ie   on which contracts for supplies and services over 25,000 euro (recently reduced from 50,000 euro) and works contracts over 50,000 euro must be advertised in a public tendering process. For some years now, the site has been well established as the national reference point for public procurement opportunities. As well as ensuring transparency and competition, the site facilitates wide participation in the public procurement function, for example,  by issuing  email alerts directly to registered suppliers when contracts that might be of interest to them are advertised and making tender documentation available for direct downloading with advertised contracts.  This website demonstrates the Government strong commitment to ensuring transparency in procurement processes and securing best value for the Irish taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Furthermore as a matter of practice all state bodies are encouraged to and do place ever increasing amounts of information and data out into the public domain via web based and other communication technologies.</P>

As the Deputy will be aware lottery applications are generally awarded in two tranches, in July and in December. Any applications which are not successful in the first tranche are considered again in the context of the funds remaining for the second tranche. The total amount paid to organisations to date from this year&rsquo;s lottery allocation is &euro;2.637m leaving &euro;1.149m available for the remainder of the year. There are 238 applications currently in the process of being assessed.</P>

	<P>Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, a person may deduct certain items of expenditure, termed &ldquo;allowable deductions&rdquo;, from their income prior to calculating their assessable income and their contribution to care.  Allowable deductions include health expenses which qualify for tax relief (i.e. expenses to which section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 apply).  Accordingly, charges in respect of acute care within an acute hospital setting qualify as an allowable deduction.  However, such expenses are only allowed net of any tax relief which may be claimed by the person or their spouse or relative. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Treatment Purchase Fund arranges hospital-based treatment for patients who have been waiting longest on surgical, inpatient waiting lists.  The Fund also arranges, on a pilot basis, outpatient consultations for people who are waiting longest for first-time appointments with a consultant.  This year, the NTPF will provide first-time consultant appointments for over 9,000 of those waiting longest.  The scheme only applies in a number of hospitals and the specialties to which it applies vary from year to year, depending on the length of waiting lists.  In addition, a person may not self-refer for an outpatient appointment &mdash; applications are made by the hospitals concerned.</P>
        <P>The NTPF has confirmed that there have been over 2,000 ENT referrals from 12 public hospitals and these patients are currently being seen and treated.  The NTPF also advises that the Outpatient Department (OPD) initiative has completed referrals for 2010 at this stage.  In relation to OPD activity in 2011, this will be agreed in the context of the budgetary process.</P>
        <P>The scheduling of patients for hospital treatment is a matter for the consultant concerned in each case and is determined on the basis of clinical need.   Should the patient&rsquo;s general prac<Col N="332"/>titioner consider that the particular patient&rsquo;s condition has worsened and warrants an earlier appointment, the GP would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant involved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 1st October 2010,  medical card holders are required to pay a 50c charge for medicines and other prescription items supplied to them by community pharmacists. The charges are subject to a cap of  &euro;10 per month for each person or family. </P>
        <P>Should a person or family pay more than &euro;10, the HSE will issue refunds automatically on a quarterly basis based on the information received from the dispensing pharmacy.  However, if a person considers that they have not received the refund due to them there is a refund claim form available through the HSE and an online version of the form is available on www.medicalcard.ie or www.hse.ie.</P>
        <P>In some cases family members may not have the same medical card number, e.g. where more than one doctor is used by the family. It is important for all of the family members to be grouped together so that any prescription charge paid by them goes towards reaching the maximum total monthly charge payable. Patients can check online that all members of their family are grouped together or contact the HSE directly at 1800-252-919. If necessary, patients can set their family up as a family group on www.medicalcard.ie   and print off a certificate (family certificate) to give to their pharmacists. Patients can also contact their Local<?oasys _jy ?>Health Office or call 1890-252-919 to provide their family details and a certificate will be posted out.</P>

	<P>The Hayes Report makes detailed constructive recommendations about the operation of specific services in the hospital and all of these will be implemented. </P>
        <P>I met with Dr. Hayes on 8 November to discuss the implications of his report with him.  I met with the Chair of Tallaght Hospital on 9 November.  I have also had discussions with the CEO of the HSE about the report.  The main focus will be on what initiatives are needed both in the hospital and in the wider health system to provide sustained improvements in the services for patients.</P><Col N="333"/>
        <P>An additional 2 locum consultant radiologists were appointed to the hospital in January 2010 to assist in dealing with the backlog of X-rays.  The backlog has been cleared and currently there are 0.54 locums in post at the hospital.   On 7 September 2010 the HSE issued formal approval to Tallaght Hospital to appoint two new consultant radiologists. This is in line with the recommendations of the Hayes Report.  Interviews are expected to take place shortly  and the two successful candidates will take up duty be as soon as possible in 2011.</P>
        <P>The Hayes Report recommended that consultant radiologist staffing levels should be reviewed to ensure they are appropriate to the work load in each radiology department.  The HSE is committed to carrying out a review of consultant radiologist staffing levels in hospitals and to strengthening workforce planning across all radiology departments.  The review will be informed by the results of a survey of consultant radiologist staffing which is currently being undertaken by the Faculty of Radiology.  The aim is to complete this study by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Since 2005 there has been a 34% national increase in the numbers of consultant radiologists, from 183 to 245.  Ireland now has a ratio of 1 consultant radiologist per 17,959 population, which is similar to the UK at 1 per 18,040 per population.</P>
        <P>The HSE is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Hayes report as soon as possible.  I am confident that adopting this approach will help ensure the provision of a timely and quality radiology service in Tallaght Hospital.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January 2010, is implemented by my office.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Children are eligible for the ECCE scheme when they are aged between three years and three months and four years and six months on 1 September of the relevant  year.  As this is interpreted broadly, children were eligible in September 2010 if they were born on or between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 and children will be eligible in September 2011 if they were born on or between 2 February 2007 and 30 June 2008.  In January 2010, 53,000 children availed of the scheme.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that this figure increased to 63,000 children in September 2010, the first full year of the scheme.  This represents a participation rate of 94% of children in the year before primary school.</P>

	<P>The spend by subhead to the end of October on Vote 39 &mdash; the Department of Health and Children, Vote 40 &mdash; the Health Service Executive and Vote 41 &mdash; the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is set out in the tables below.</P>
        <P>Vote 39 is under profile on current spending by some &euro;40m at the end of October, and some &euro;10m on capital spending.  Some of this variance is as a result of timing issues, but some saving on the Vote spending is now anticipated.  Vote 40 is under profile on both capital and current in Gross terms, but significant shortfalls in Appropriations-in-Aid in relation to the Health Levy has resulted in the need to apply for a Supplementary Estimate.  In the case of Vote 41, current spending is under profile by &euro;36m and capital spending is under profile by just under &euro;8m.  As with Vote 39, some of this variance is caused by timing issues although it is anticipated that there will be some savings on this Vote also.</P>
        <P><?oasys _dc18- ?>In the case of both Vote 39 and Vote 41, any savings realised will be used as a contribution towards the Supplementary Estimate on Vote 40 to reduce the Exchequer liability in this regard.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>

	<P>As Minister for Transport I have overall responsibility for specified functions in the aviation, land transport and maritime sectors as determined by Government and the Oireachtas.  A number of my responsibilities have been delegated to bodies under the aegis of my Department through enactments by the Oireachtas.  The functions and accountabilities of these bodies are set out by statute in the Acts establishing those bodies and in any subsequent amending Acts.  Exchequer funding is provided through the Department of Transport Vote to a number of these bodies for the purposes of providing transport infrastructure and services and in some cases to cover administration expenses.  </P>
        <P>The matter of devolving more responsibilities to State bodies is kept under ongoing review with the most recent being the transfer of additional functions from my Department to the National Transport Authority.  In line with overall Government policy, a number of proposals for streamlining the delivery of State services by the merging of bodies or functions under my Department&rsquo;s remit are also under active consideration.</P>

	<P>My Department has now examined the report on Restorative Justice provided to me by the National Commission.  On foot of that examination, I am pleased to inform the Deputy and the House that the Probation Service will be introducing a scheme before the end of this year to test a range of restorative interventions for adult offenders based on the recommendations contained in the report.  This will enable my Department to evaluate what role such interventions as recommended in the report might play having regard to overall effectiveness, potential, and value for money considerations.</P>
        <P>My Department, through the Probation Service, already funds two restorative justice projects, one based in Nenagh and a second in Tallaght.  The scheme will involve an expansion of these two projects.  The Nenagh Community Reparation project will be extended to Limerick and Tipperary while the Tallaght based Restorative Justice Service will be extended to the Criminal Courts of Justice.  The objective of the scheme is to build the foundation for the implementation of a robust restorative justice model of practice providing an alternative to a prison sentence of less than 12 months duration.  This will test the model&rsquo;s ability to manage up to 100 adult offenders by Community Reparation and up to 300 by the Restorative Justice Service.  The model will involve the use of community and volunteer resources.</P>
        <P>The Probation Service will monitor, oversee, and evaluate the implementation of the scheme and will provide a report on the effectiveness and value for money of the model after a 12 month operational period.  The Deputy can be assured that my focus is to encourage the use, to the greatest extent possible, of the menu of non-custodial options available to the courts.  I believe the restorative justice concept has a place in that range of available options.</P>

	<P>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 requires convicted sex offenders to notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of their name and home address within seven days of becoming subject to the notification requirement.  Thereafter offenders must notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of any subsequent changes to their name or address, within seven days of the event.  Offenders who leave the State for an intended continuous period of seven days or more must inform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in advance of their leaving.  It is an offence <Col N="341"/>under the Act for a person convicted of an offence covered by the Act to fail to inform his/her employer of that conviction, where the work or service provided consists mainly of the person having unsupervised access to, or contact with, a child or children or a mentally impaired person or persons.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>These requirements also apply to any offenders convicted in another jurisdiction of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a system in place for the monitoring of all persons subject to these requirements.  The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit monitors and manages the notification provisions and maintains all information relating to persons who have obligations under the Act.  There is a nominated Garda Inspector in each Garda Division who has responsibility for the monitoring of persons subject to the requirements of the Act in their Division.  As soon as the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit is advised by a relevant authority, such as the Irish Prison Service, the Courts Service or a foreign law enforcement agency, of the impending release or movement of sex offenders into their area this information is immediately passed to the nominated Inspectors, who are advised of information relevant to their Divisions.</P>
        <P>Once a person becomes subject to the legislation he or she is informed by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of his or her obligations under the Act.  Should they arise, child protection issues are raised with the health authorities, as set out in the Children First Guidelines.  In cases where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aware that a person from outside the jurisdiction who is subject to the notification requirements is entering the jurisdiction, they make every effort to ensure they are aware of their obligations under the legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.  A member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not below the rank of Chief Superintendent, may apply to the Circuit Court for a civil order against a convicted sex offender whose behaviour in the community gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reasonable cause for concern that such an order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm.  The information supplied by the Deputy has been passed to the Garda authorities.</P>

	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal.  Before dealing with the substantive question, the background of the person&rsquo;s history in the State needs to be set out as the details supplied contain errors. The first formal presentation by this person to the immigration authorities was on the date of her asylum application on 26 August, 2008 (at age 19 years) but claims to have been in the State since January, 2005. The details supplied by the Deputy are unclear but also suggest that this person has been living in the State since the age of 5. This is not the case.</P>
        <P>This person refused RIA accommodation in 2008 and has only recently sought to avail of RIA accommodation. The RIA understands that this person was living with family members in the interim. In accordance with its accommodation policy, the RIA offered this person accommodation at Lisbrook accommodation centre in Galway city but this offer was refused.

	<P>Participants at the Global Irish Economic Forum, held at Farmleigh in September 2009, expressed strong support for the development of new structured opportunities abroad for Irish graduates. The Farmleigh Fellowship programme was one such initiative to emerge from the Forum.  It was developed by a number of participants based in Singapore and launched in May of this year.</P>
        <P>The new programme will provide 25 Irish graduates with the opportunity to work in Asia on placement with a broad range of international companies for four months and to participate in a joint MSc degree from University College Cork and the Nanyang Business School of the Nanyang Technical University in Singapore.  It is expected that participant orientation in companies will take place in Ireland over the coming weeks with academic work beginning in January in UCC. The Fellowship has developed a number of productive strategic partnerships in the course of bringing the programme to this stage, including with Enterprise Ireland and IBEC, and provides an innovative model through which the next generation of Irish businesspeople can take advantage of the enormous opportunities that exist in Asia.</P>
        <P>The Fellowship has been awarded &euro;135,000 under the Emigrant Support Programme administered by my Department and has raised significant additional funds through participating companies. There are a number of other Government sponsored graduate programmes in operation at present, including those offered by Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia. In recent weeks, the Government funded Irish Technology Leadership Group has announced its intention to establish a mentoring programme for graduates in the field of technology in partnership with the support of private sector sponsorship. My Department, in close consultation with members of the Global Irish Network, will continue to explore ways in which opportunities for Irish graduates abroad may be expanded.</P>

	<P>My Department is responsible for two Votes &mdash; Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs) and Vote 29 (International Cooperation). Under Vote <Col N="352"/>28, I expect there will be an overspend of approximately &euro;15.2 million on Subhead I (Contributions to International Organisations) in 2010.  This will be partly offset by savings of &euro;1.8 million on the Administrative Budget and &euro;1 million in Subhead C (Support for Irish Emigrant Services).  A Supplementary Estimate is required to cover the remaining shortfall of &euro;12.4 million and it is proposed that the necessary funds will be found by reducing expenditure under Vote 29.  The shortfall on Subhead I is mainly due to increased costs in Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to United Nations Peacekeeping Operations.  These payments are assessed on an ongoing basis by the United Nations and are mandatory in nature.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The level of contribution is difficult to forecast.  It is affected by changes to the overall budgets at the UN, currency fluctuations and adjustments to Ireland&rsquo;s contribution key.  I do not expect any significant underspend or overspend in other subheads under Vote 28.  In terms of receipts, the current trend suggests that Appropriations in Aid for the Department will exceed the estimated amount by approximately &euro;1m.  This arises largely from a higher than expected number of passport applications. Under Vote 29, expenditure patterns are in line with budget projections.  A full spend is forecast across all programme subheads.  A reduction in overall expenditure of &euro;12.4 million will be necessary in order to provide funding for the Supplementary Estimate being proposed for Vote 28.</P>

	<P>The &lsquo;Gateway Ireland&rsquo; website project was one of the specific initiatives to emerge from the Global Irish Economic Forum, held at Farmleigh in September 2009.  The proposal was made by Mr John McColgan at the Forum and has subsequently been taken forward by a private sector group led by him. It is designed to provide a comprehensive and multi-layered online facility, through which the relationship between Ireland and the global Irish can be further enhanced.  A public seminar aimed at raising awareness of the project and its potential was held at Dublin Castle in May of this year.</P>
        <P>I welcome the initiative and believe that it has the potential to provide an important new tool for connecting the Irish at home and abroad.  I have also been supportive of a number of other online projects developed recently with a similar purpose.   While Mr McColgan has briefed me on progress being achieved since the Forum, &lsquo;Gateway Ireland&rsquo; is a private sector-led initiative and, as such, my Department has no operational involvement or responsibility for its implementation.  Mr McColgan has confirmed to my officials in recent days that significant progress continues to be made towards making the project operational in 2011. I would like to acknowledge the considerable time and resources devoted to date by Mr McColgan to this project and I look forward to its successful implementation.</P>

	<P>The importance of Irish culture in promoting Ireland, including Irish business, abroad was a prominent theme at the Global Irish <Col N="353"/>Economic Forum held at Farmleigh House in September, 2009.  During the course of the Forum, Mr Dermot Desmond proposed that a &lsquo;world class&rsquo; centre or University for the performing arts and Irish culture be established in a landmark building in Ireland.  The goal would be to make Ireland a global centre for artistic and creative education, innovation and technology.</P>
        <P>The project, which is a private not a state initiative, is ongoing under the leadership of Mr Desmond. A seminar to examine the project took place in late June at which the major national third-level institutions were represented at a senior level.  I understand that a detailed proposal shall be shared with the relevant partners shortly.  Any issues relating to the third level sector will be a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.

	<P>The creation of the new Global Irish Network was one of the key recommendations arising from the Global Irish Economic Forum, held at Farmleigh in September 2009. I was delighted to formally announce the establishment of the Network in February this year at the Irish Embassy in London. Since then, regional meetings have also been held in France, Germany, China, Australia and, most recently, in New York, where US and Canadian members of the Network met on 11 November.</P>
        <P>The Network now includes over three hundred individuals, based in thirty three countries, and provides an important mechanism for building on the work begun at Farmleigh. It includes some of the most influential Irish and Irish-connected individuals abroad and provides Ireland with an invaluable resource of international expertise from which we can draw as we work towards economic recovery.  This direct access to key private-sector decision makers across the globe has the potential to be a considerable source of &lsquo;soft power&rsquo; for the country in the years to come. The Network also serves as an additional resource for the Government in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s economic, cultural and tourism messages in key markets and offers a formal forum through which members can exchange views and take forward practical initiatives.</P>
        <P>At the recent meeting in New York, participants made clear their determination to support and assist Ireland in addressing our current economic challenges.  They also reiterated their willingness to encourage the international media and business communities to focus, to a greater extent, on Ireland&rsquo;s continued economic strengths and opportunities.</P>

	<P>In order to qualify for domiciliary care allowance a child must have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age. This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living. The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</P>
        <P>Eligibility for domiciliary care allowance is not based primarily on the impairment or disease, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating a degree of extra care and attention required; as such it is not possible to say in advance if a child diagnosed with any specific condition will qualify for a payment under the scheme. Every application is assessed on its individual merits by one of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors and a medical opinion, based on the information submitted by the applicant in support of their claim, is offered in each case. The deciding officer then makes a decision having considered the medical opinion provided and all the other information available.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As the income to the Social Insurance Fund will be less than its expected expenditure in 2010, a subvention is required to fund expenditure on schemes such as State Pension Contributory, Widow(er)&rsquo;s Contributory Pension and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit.  The Exchequer Subvention in 2010 is expected to be almost &euro;1,969 million.  The estimates of Fund income and expenditure in 2011 is currently being finalised in the context of preparations for the forthcoming Budget and these will be announced on Budget Day, December 7 next.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 to 168, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>The Social Insurance Fund finances expenditure on insurance based welfare benefits.  It held cash equivalent reserves of &euro;890 million at the beginning of 2010. The amount by which income exceeded expenditure has fallen since 2006 and the Fund has run an annual deficit since 2008, using accumulated reserves to supplement the funding required for benefit payments.  These cash reserves were exhausted earlier this year. The shortfall between Fund income and expenditure is being met by way of subvention from the Department&rsquo;s Vote 38.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that traditionally, social insurance spending has been funded on a tripartite basis &mdash; with contributions coming from the exchequer, employers and employees. The exchequer is the residual financier of the Fund and exchequer contributions were the norm for over forty years &mdash; for example, in 1967, the state contribution was 38% of Fund expenditure and almost 29% in 1985.  However, no exchequer contribution was required between 1996 and 2009 as the Fund was in surplus on foot of contributions from employers and workers.</P>
        <P>An actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, undertaken in 2005, which covered the period from 2006 to 2061, highlighted that progressive action is required if future costs, including pensions, are to be met. This will involve finding an appropriate balance between the three strands of the tripartite funding system.</P>
        <P>The following table sets out the annual information required by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>To qualify for payment of rent supplement a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement. A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by the relevant local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.</P>
        <P>In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the local housing authority in the area where the claim is made (and the person intends to reside). Only when the <Col N="358"/>person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement. Rent supplement is not payable while a housing needs assessment is being undertaken.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that the rent supplement has been awarded from 16 November 2010 as the housing needs assessment provided by her local authority was dated 15 November 2010.</P>

	<P>One of the qualifying conditions for mortgage interest supplement is that the amount of mortgage interest payable by the claimant should not exceed such amount as the Health Service Executive (HSE) considers reasonable to meet his or her residential and other needs. However in exceptional circumstances, the HSE may award a supplement where the amount of mortgage interest payable by a person exceeds such amount as the HSE considers reasonable to meet his or her residential and other needs. Such a supplement is only payable for a maximum of 12 months from the date of the claim. </P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that the person concerned applied for mortgage interest supplement in August 2009 and was awarded a mortgage interest supplement as an exceptional measure for 12 months until 30 September 2010 as, in the opinion of the HSE, the mortgage interest payable exceeded such amount it considered reasonable to meet her residential and other needs. The HSE further advised that payment of mortgage interest supplement has now ceased and the person concerned has appealed the decision to the HSE Appeals Office.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Deputy is referring to the back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme. This is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held. </P>
        <P>With effect from 19th July 2010, changes have been made to the qualifying conditions of the back to education scheme to reflect the present economic situation. The qualifying period for jobseekers is three months for participation in a second level course.  The period for which a person is required to be on a qualifying social welfare payment before accessing a third level course was reduced from 12 months to 9 months (a 2 year qualifying period continues to apply to participants coming from Illness Benefit).  Since 2007, people who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
        <P>In addition since 19th July, a person can avail of BTEA to resume studies in a second or subsequent year of a third level course whereas prior to July, a person could only apply for BTEA if s/he was commencing year one of a course.  This also applies to people who are granted an exemption from a period of their third level course. A person who completed earlier year(s) of his/her third level course on a part-time basis but is now getting a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, may apply for BTEA to continue the course on a full-time basis.   The requirement to be in receipt of a social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme.  A waiting period is considered essential to confer entitlement to income support for an indefinite period and is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.</P>
        <P>BTEA is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate for the scheme from which the unemployed person transfers.  It is not means-tested and changes in a participant&rsquo;s personal or family financial circumstances do not affect entitlement.  In addition, an annual cost of education allowance of &euro;500 is payable. Participants may continue to receive any secondary benefits to which they would otherwise have an entitlement to provided they continue to satisfy a means test.</P>
        <P>The conditionality of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme. Any changes would have to be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget, having regard both to needs and to the resources available to meet those needs.  In an uncertain economic environment, the priority will be to ensure that the Government strategy to stabilise the financial position is advanced and to protect those most in need in a manner which is sustainable in the years ahead.</P>

	<P>The existing rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive rent supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules. Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement is not payable where a person or their spouse or partner is in full-time employment, i.e. for 30 hours or more a week. However, a person on rent supplement, who is accepted as eligible for accommodation under the rental accommodation scheme (RAS), may return to full-time work, subject to a means test, without losing entitlement to their rent supplement payment.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to provide the ceiling on gross earnings to retain entitlement to rent supplements due to the many variables in determining a person&rsquo;s entitlement. Some of factors which affect the amount of rent supplement payable include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />The accommodation cost,</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />The household composition,</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 180 together.</P>
        <P>Child Benefit is a universal payment that assists parents in the cost associated with raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. It is paid monthly in respect of all children up to the age 16 years and in respect of children over 16 years of age up to their 18th birthday who are in full time education or have a disability.  The standard rate of payment of Child Benefit is currently &euro;150 per child per month for the first and second child.  A higher rate of payment of &euro;187 per child per month is paid in respect of the third or later child in birth order.</P>
        <P>With regard to child dependant allowances, it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to child dependant additions, which are now known as Qualified Child Increases (QCIs). QCIs are paid as supplements to weekly social welfare benefits and allowances in recognition of the need for greater incomes among benefit-dependent households with dependent children.  A QCI is payable in respect of each qualified child who normally resides with the claimant.  If a dependant is aged between 18 and 22 years a QCI is payable if s/he attends a full-time day course of study, instruction or training at a recognised institute of education.</P>
        <P>Payment of the QCI can continue up to 22 years of age or up to the end of the academic year in which the child reaches 22 in the case of long-term payments as well as short-term payments that have been in payment for at least 156 days.</P>
        <P>A qualified child increase is also payable after the dependant reaches age 18:</P>
        <P el="9"><Miles com="bull66" />for 3 months immediately after leaving second-level education or finishing the Leaving Certificate Examination, whichever is later,</P>
        <P el="9"><Miles com="bull66" />until the following 30 June or until they complete their full-time second-level day course, whichever is the earlier, or</P>
        <P el="9"><Miles com="bull66" />for the summer holiday period up to the beginning of the next academic year for students in third level education.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="9">If the dependant reaches age 22 during an academic year while attending a full-time day course of education, they continue to be regarded as a qualified child up to the end of that academic year provided they continue to receive full-time education.</P>

	<P>Current legislation provides that where a person, aged 25 years or under, is living with a parent or step-parent in the family home, an assessment is made of the yearly value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed by that person by virtue of residing with a parent or step parent. The value of the benefit and privilege assessed is based on the level of the parents&rsquo; (and their partners) income.</P>
        <P>This rule does not apply where the person is living with other relatives e.g. a brother or sister or with non-relatives.</P>
        <P>There are two exceptions to this rule.  No assessment is made where a married/co-habiting son/daughter is living with his/her parents or where a person returns to the parental home having had an independent life-style elsewhere in Ireland or abroad for an appreciable length of time e.g. at least 3 years.  In the later case a nominal assessment of &euro;7.00 is applied.</P>
        <P>Any changes to the above would have to be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget, having regard both to needs and to the resources available to meet those needs.  In an uncertain economic environment, my priority will be to ensure that the Government strategy to stabilise the financial position is advanced and to protect those most in need in a manner which is sustainable in the years ahead.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance on 30 November 2009.  His application was disallowed on the grounds that he did not satisfy the habitual residency requirements. The reasons he did not satisfy the condition of being habitually resident in the State are as follows:</P>
        <P el="5">1. He has lived most of his life outside Ireland.</P>
        <P el="5">2. His centre of interest is not Ireland.</P><Col N="363"/>

One of the conditions laid down by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform in renewing this person&rsquo;s temporary permission to remain in the State is that he will engage in employment and not become a burden on the State.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The person concerned appealed the decision in relation to the habitual residency condition.   On 18 September 2010, the person concerned was advised by letter that the Appeals Officer had decided that the appellant was not habitually resident in the State for social welfare purposes and accordingly, the appeal was disallowed.</P>

        <P>The person concerned appealed this decision and was referred for another medical examination on 17th February 2010, which was carried out by a different medical assessor.

On the capital side, total expenditure at the end of October was &euro;68.2 million, an underspend of &euro;30.7 million or 31% compared to profiled expenditure.  As the capital programmes administered by my Department are primarily demand driven, it is difficult to profile expenditure accurately and the underspend on the capital programmes is mainly due to a slower than anticipated drawdown of funding.

	<P>I have no function in operational matters of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), as it is an independent statutory body established under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. However, dispute resolution statistics are published as part of the annual report of the PRTB and are available on their website at www.prtb.ie  </P>
        <P>In November 2009 I announced the preliminary outcomes of my review of the Residential Tenancies Act which regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private residential rented sector.  Among those outcomes is a commitment to introduce fixed fines where deposits are found to have been illegally retained and to consider the issue in more detail.</P>
        <P>The PRTB commissioned research on the viability of a separate deposit retention scheme in Ireland pursuant to its function, under section 151(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, to provide advice to the Minister concerning policy in relation to the private rented sector. On <Col N="366"/>foot of this research, the Board endorsed my proposal to introduce fixed fines as outlined above and also decided not to recommend the establishment of a deposit retention scheme.</P>
        <P>My Department has considered a number of critical issues in this area, and I have decided that it is prudent to proceed at present with the fixed penalty proposal but not with a wider deposit retention scheme. It is my belief that the fixed penalty model will act as a significant deterrent for landlords who might otherwise consider retaining a deposit without any legitimate grounds for so doing.  I believe that this initiative will, over time, greatly reduce the current problem of deposit retention.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to have the General Scheme of a Bill amending the Residential Tenancies Act before the Government very shortly.</P>

	<P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the local authorities are responsible for waste licensing and waste permitting, respectively, and enforce rigorously the conditions attached to licences and permits.  It is a matter for the EPA and/or the local authorities to decide on the appropriate enforcement actions in relation to any non-compliance matters.  Two Ministerial policy directions in relation to waste-related enforcement matters have issued under section 60 of the Waste Management Act 1996.  Circular letter WIR 04/05, which issued on 3 May 2005, and Circular letter WPRR 04/08, which issued on 25 July 2008, addressed a range of issues including the intensification of action against illegal waste activity and the appropriate use of sanctions and deterrents to secure the required environmental outcome.  Further information on these policy directions is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.environ.ie  . </P>
        <P>Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, however, I am precluded from exercising any power in relation to the performance, in particular circumstances, by a local authority or the EPA of a function conferred on it. I am satisfied that the powers available to the EPA and the local authorities for monitoring compliance with waste licences /permits and conditions are adequate, but will keep the matter under review and will take account of suggestions which bodies with enforcement responsibilities and other parties make from time to time in relation to aspects of the enforcement provisions of the Waste Management Acts.</P>
        <P>Under planning legislation, the decision as to whether to grant a planning application, with or without conditions, is a matter for the relevant planning authority in the first instance and for An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal.  Issues in relation to planning enforcement are raised with my Department from time to time but enforcement of planning control is a matter for the relevant planning authority, which can take action if a development does not have the required permission, or where the terms of a permission have not been met.  Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement matter, with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.</P>

        <P>However, it is the role of the Minister and Government to set the policy framework and I intend that Irish waste policy will focus on maximising what should be seen as a resource.   It is against that background that I have expressed concerns regarding the potential implications of the large scale Poolbeg waste facility for the more progressive approach to waste management I am determined to pursue.</P>

This set out the various elements being considered as part of the development of a new national waste management policy for the coming decade and beyond, with a focus on a resource management approach.  There will be clear implications for the provision of waste infrastructure, as waste is driven away from residual treatment and towards recycling and reuse.</P>
        <P>The consultation closed on 1 October 2010 and I am currently considering the submissions received with a view to bringing a final policy statement to Government for decision at the earliest opportunity.

It is, therefore, a matter for the EPA to ensure compliance with any waste licence issued, and to decide on the appropriate enforcement action in relation to any non-compliance matters.

	<P>The most recent three-year report on water quality, by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Water Quality in Ireland 2004-2006, identifies nutrient enrichment causing eutrophication as the main threat to water quality in Ireland. Municipal sources (mainly sewage discharges) and agricultural activities are identified as the main sources of nutrient enrichment.</P>
        <P>Of the 2,985 river and stream sites examined in the report, a total of 39 locations were assessed as seriously polluted.  Municipal sources were suspected to be the likely cause of pollution in 21 of these cases.  A further 386 sites were considered to be moderately polluted with municipal sources being the suspected cause in 166 of these cases.  The information requested in relation to land pollution is not available in my Department. The Department continues to invest substantially in the development of national water services capacity through the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 .

	<P>The monitoring, assessment and management of ambient air quality in Ireland is carried out according to the requirements of the EU Air Quality Framework Directive. This Directive was transposed into Irish law through the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations 1999. Under further regulations made in 2002, 2004 and 2009, specific ambient air quality standards have been prescribed for the following pollutants: </P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead  (2002);</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />carbon monoxide and benzene (2002);</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />ozone (2004); and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />polyaromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, nickel, cadmium and mercury (2009).</P><Col N="372"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P FLI="0" el="5">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility for monitoring Irish air quality. The EPA continually monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants via a network of air quality monitoring stations located around the country. The EPA reports the results of the air quality monitoring of the above pollutants on its website at:</P>
<P FLI="0" el="0">http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/monitoring/air/data  /. My Department keeps these data under ongoing review to identify any significant trends which might emerge and also meets periodically with the EPA on air quality issues.    The EPA also publishes a comprehensive annual report on air quality, the most recent being Air Quality in Ireland 2009 &mdash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality   (November 2010). This report, copies of which are available on the EPA&rsquo;s website, provides an overview of ambient air quality trends in Ireland in 2008 based on data from 30 monitoring stations and a further 18 stations operated by local authorities to measure black smoke. The report confirmed that air quality was generally good at monitoring stations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The report did find that levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter (PM10) remain a concern in larger cities owing to traffic levels. My Department has met with the EPA, Dublin City Council and the Health Service Executive to discuss elevated recordings of nitrogen dioxide at Winetavern Street in April 2009 and the four Dublin local authorities are now preparing a plan to address this. Provisional data indicate that levels of nitrogen dioxide in Dublin measured during the first 9 months of this year are below the statutory limit value.</P>
        <P>Domestic solid fuel use is the other main source of particulate matter in air in Ireland and particularly impacts air quality in areas where the sale of bituminous coal is permitted. As a result, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns are similar to, or worse than, those in cities.</P>
        <P>In order to improve air quality, the sulphur content of bituminous coal is currently limited to 0.7 % by a Voluntary Agreement with members of the Solid Fuel Trade Group (SFTG). This agreement has been in place since 2002 and has helped to protect air quality standards in areas where bituminous coal continues to be used.</P>
        <P>My Department, in consultation with representatives of the SFTG and other stakeholders, is now giving consideration to further strengthening measures to improve ambient air quality and the protection of human health and environmental quality from the pollutants caused by the burning of solid fuel. In this context, the establishment of a statutory basis for the 0.7% maximum sulphur content standard is under consideration. This work is being carried out in the context of the forthcoming application of the carbon tax to solid fuel in the domestic sector.</P>

	<P>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to continue to meet the accommodation needs of as many households as possible within the resources available.  The current oversupply of housing is a key factor in that regard, and there is potential to make economic necessity and the response to social need work in tandem by utilising unsold housing stock to accommodate families in need of social housing support.</P>
        <P>In the context of rising social housing need, the priority must be to maximise delivery of social housing to cater for the greatest level of need at good value. The restructuring of the social housing investment programme to allow for a greater role for the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing offer the most effective and efficient response to both market realities and housing need, taking account of the resources available, current market conditions, and the need for a broader range of more flexible delivery mechanisms based on the life-cycle approach as set out in the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, Delivering Homes: Sustaining Communities.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It is usual that there is significant expenditure from the Vote towards the end of the year and I expect that this will also be the case in 2010.  The position in relation to 2010 spending is being monitored closely by my Department, in consultation with local authorities.  While it is <Col N="378"/>likely that there will some savings in 2010, it is not possible at this stage to quantify the precise extent of any savings.  I do, however, expect that any such amount will be modest relative to the overall provisions.</P>

	<P>Investment priorities in water services are set out under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 which I published in April 2010 following a comprehensive assessment of needs by water services authorities and my Department. The scope and format of the Programme for 2010 to 2012 is designed better to reflect ongoing environmental and economic priorities, to maximise the return on public funds being invested in the sector, to ensure that the Programme is realistic in its level of ambition and that it clearly sets out investment priorities on a river basin basis.</P>
        <P>The provision of water services is a function of the 34 city and county councils which are designated as water services authorities by the Water Services Act 2007.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes recommended that, in line with the EU strategy of river basin planning, the administrative structure for water services should follow that approach and move away from a city/county basis. The Group also recommended that existing administrative structures should be reduced from 34 local authorities and replaced with one national authority with an ability to plan and manage on the basis of river basins.</P>
        <P>The Local Government Efficiency Review Group Report, published earlier this year, recommended the development of an enhanced regional office approach at river basin level for, <i>inter alia,</i> water services infrastructure delivery and implementation of the River Basin Management Plans.  Work has commenced in my Department on implementing this specific recommendation.</P>
        <P>Transferring responsibility for the provision of water services from 34 authorities to a single national authority would be a very substantial undertaking in terms of administrative restructuring and legislative reform. The priority at this stage is ensuring that the structures in place and those that will evolve on foot of the recommendations of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group Report can both deliver key water services infrastructure and support the implementation of river basin management planning.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, published yesterday includes a commitment to establish an independent water regulator for the sector as part of the introduction of domestic water metering.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 215 together. </P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter for private sector service providers operating in a liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  Service providers&rsquo; decisions to provide broadband services in areas are taken on the basis of commercial viability.  Such decisions are matters for the service providers concerned.</P>
        <P>ComReg&rsquo;s website www.callcosts.ie provides detailed information on the various private sector telecommunications products and services available on a county by county basis including counties Sligo and Leitrim.</P>
        <P>It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend, subject to Government approval, to launch a Rural Broadband Scheme by the end of the year.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) areas.</P>
        <P>There will be a competitive process to engage a service provider who will offer a broadband service to qualified applicants under the scheme.  While the exact details have yet to be finalised, I expect that the service offered under this scheme would at least match the service offered under the NBS.  This process will be technology neutral &mdash; it will be a matter for the bidders to decide which technical approach they propose in their bids.</P>
        <P>Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</P>

        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P FLI="0">A significant portion of 2010 spend is scheduled to take place between end October and year end due to a combination of timing issues and an initial slower than expected uptake on certain programmes.  While it is likely that there will be some under spend at year end, it is expected that it will be substantially lower than end October spend might suggest as timing issues resolve themselves and increased uptake on sustainable energy programmes translates into increased expenditure.</P>

	<P>As outlined in the replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 10960 of 7 April 2004 and 37130 of 19 October 2010, the person named lodged an application under the 1994 Scheme of Early Retirement from Farming on 10 December 1999. This application was rejected and the applicant was informed of the reasons. The Department was not aware at the time that the person named had ceased farming after 1996 and had rented her land and this was not one of the reasons for the rejection of the application. Had this point been considered, it would have been an additional reason <Col N="384"/>for rejecting the application as it is evident that the person named could not have fulfilled all of the conditions outlined in Section 1, Part II (Terms and Conditions), under the heading &lsquo;Person eligible to become a Transferor&rsquo;. This requirement states that:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="3">&ldquo;<i>In order to become a transferor, the applicant must on the date he/she ceases farming, i.e. the date on which all the transfer documents are signed or the land re-assigned to non-agricultural uses:</i></P>
        <P LI="2" el="3"><i><Miles com="mdash66" />be between his/her 55th and 66th</i>  <i> birthdays and</i></P>
        <P LI="2" el="3"><i><Miles com="mdash66" />be farming an area of not less than 5 hectares of utilisable agricultural area (UAA) and</i></P>
        <P LI="2" el="3"><i><Miles com="mdash66" />have practised farming as a main occupation for the preceding ten years.</i>&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="3">Under the terms of the scheme, lands had to be transferred by gift, lease or sale to eligible Transferees.  Leases had to be for a minimum of five years. Land let for shorter periods was not eligible.  A copy of the 1994 Scheme Terms and Conditions has been sent to the person named.</P>

	<P>On the basis of expenditure to date and that forecast to year-end, my Department anticipates savings on the Vote in 2010 across some subheads.  The anticipated savings will arise across various subheads on the Administrative Budget as well as across a range of other schemes and services.  Some reallocation between subheads may also occur.</P>
        <P>The difficulty in estimating the full-year savings arises as a result of the high proportion of scheme payments that are made in the final quarter of the year, for example approximately &euro;1 billion has been paid under the Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Area Scheme to date and I am confident that, by year-end, expenditure under both schemes will be well in excess of &euro;1.2 billion.  It is my intention that every effort will continue to be made to have all remaining payments issued as soon as possible.  In addition, there are high levels of payments made under REPS in the latter months of the year and those payments will also continue until year-end.  The end-November figures will provide a clearer estimate of the anticipated full-year expenditure and I will arrange to have a summary of the situation sent directly to the Deputy at that stage.</P>

	<P>My Department, in co-operation with Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs, held a seminar in the Philippines in September 2007 in order to demonstrate the safety standards applicable to Irish food products and the effectiveness of our BSE controls.  The veterinary authorities in the Philippines wrote to my Department in early 2008 requesting a list of approved meat plants, from which to make a selection for audit. This list was forwarded to the Philippines and in June 2008, they selected four pigmeat plants and six beef plants to complete a detailed pre-audit questionnaire.  In August 2008 the authorities officially lifted their ban on Irish beef, subject to an inspection visit. In April 2009 my Department responded to the Filipino authorities with completed questionnaires from nine of the selected plants, one plant having decided not to proceed.</P>
        <P>Plans were subsequently drawn up on two occasions to receive an inspection delegation from the Philippines.  The first arrangements for an inspection visit were made for September 2009, but had to be rescheduled at the behest of the delegation.  Unfortunately the rescheduled visit which was planned for November 2009, was also cancelled at short notice, as the Filipino veterinary team could not obtain clearance to travel from their own administration.  The matter <Col N="386"/>has been kept under review and it is hoped that we will be in a position to renew the invitation to the Filipino authorities to carry out an inspection visit in the near future.</P>

	<P>I assume the question relates specifically to amending the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; under the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  Access to the employment dispute settling bodies under the Industrial Relations Acts is governed by the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in Section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  Workers not included within this definition are normally covered by separate schemes of Conciliation and Arbitration.</P>
        <P>Section 23(1)(e) of the 1990 Act excludes, inter alia, &ldquo;an officer of a vocational education committee&rdquo; from this definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo;. Arising from an agreement between management and union sides to abolish the existing Conciliation and Arbitration machinery for vocational educational committee officers and to bring them within the scope of the Industrial Relations Acts, it is now proposed to amend the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; to include such officers, with the exception of teachers, within the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in the Act.  An amendment to this effect is included in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009, which is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The question of an amendment to the Industrial Relations Acts to provide for the inclusion of persons employed in the civil service in the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; may arise in future in the context of ongoing discussions between civil service management and unions in relation to possible changes in arrangements under the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme. These discussions would be a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise; Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Innovation Taskforce Report, published last March, made recommendations across a wide range of areas, including the need to transform our intellectual property arrangements. The intellectual property-related recommendations contained in the report are aimed at ensuring that industry and businesses will experience a predictable, consistent and speedy approach when engaging with research institutions to commercialise intellectual property.</P>
        <P>In response, I established an Intellectual Property Implementation Group last June to drive the implementation of these recommendations within a short time frame, in order to ensure that all enterprises, from small businesses to multinationals, get better access to Government-supported intellectual property and can then use it to create jobs and drive our economic <Col N="387"/>recovery. This group includes IP experts from business, the VC community, Technology Transfer Offices of universities, and is supported by an IP lawyer.</P>
        <P>A key task for the Group is to develop a more user-friendly system for industry to commercialise intellectual property.  The ambition is to give Ireland a competitive advantage over many other countries and the goal is to create smart and sustainable jobs.  In tandem with this work, my Department, in consultation with key research funding agencies is currently working on enhancing and updating existing intellectual property policies and supports. The development of a clear intellectual property policy will help Ireland maximise the return on public investment and support the commercialisation of Irish research and development.</P>
        <P>In order to promote Ireland as a centre of excellence for the registration of patents, we must ensure that our intellectual property legislative framework in this area meets both our national needs and our international obligations. The Patent (Amendment) Act, 2006 contains the necessary substantive legislation provisions to give effect to a number of international agreements. The Patent (Amendment) Rules, 2009 bring Irish rules more fully in line with European and worldwide standards and provide a straightforward patenting system making use of available technology for easier access to intellectual property protection for all users of the system.</P>
        <P>The Innovation Taskforce Report also made proposals relating to marketing Ireland as a location for research and commercialisation of Intellectual Property.  These proposals are under review by my Department and a number of initiatives are in train. For example, legislation in been prepared to enable Ireland to ratify the London Agreement, a review of the Patent (Amendment) Act, 2006 is under way and we continue to support the creation of the EU patent though negotiations in Brussels as a matter of urgency.  The Patent Office has embarked on a number of information seminars to industry and provides one to one support to innovators.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim in respect of the individual concerned on 15 June, 2010.  This claim awaits processing.</P>
        <P>In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements claims dating from April 2010 are currently being processed.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Almost doubling the number of staff   working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</P><Col N="388"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  In 2009, my Department processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on the previous year.  Furthermore, the level of new claims processed in the first ten months of 2010 was 63,484 &mdash; up over 66 % on the corresponding 10-month period in 2009 (38,149) and surpassing the total amount of claims processed for the full year 2009.  The backlog of claims is decreasing &mdash; reducing from its highest level in November 2009 of 43,608 to a current level of 28,300.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The additional &euro;8m for LEADER is required due to greater than expected take up under the Rural Development Programme 2007-13 (RDP) during 2010. Many groups are finding that project promoters are in a position to complete projects earlier than expected and, therefore, require additional funding in order to meet those demands. Accordingly, this Supplementary Estimate will allow worthwhile RDP projects to be completed, which will have a positive effect on the rural economy and the quality of life in rural areas.  For every euro spent, it will also lead to Appropriations-in-Aid into the Exchequer of up to 55% from the EU.  The Supplementary Estimate will also facilitate the payment of grants under the Gaeltacht Housing Scheme in respect of eligible applications that were on hand at the time of the suspension of the scheme.</P><Col N="390"/>

        <P FLI="0">Expenditure on the Defence Vote to date in 2010 is somewhat lower than profiled across pay and non-pay subheads. However, there are significant spending commitments for the remainder of the year. At this stage it is projected that the year-end position will show gross savings of approx &euro;21m, excesses of approx &euro;12.5m and surplus appropriations-in-aid of approx &euro;1m, resulting in overall net savings of &euro;9.5m.</P>

</table>
        <P FLI="0">Expenditure to date on the Army Pensions Vote is higher than profiled and a Supplementary Estimate in the sum of &euro;9.5m is required for 2010. This arises mainly from the higher than anticipated number of personnel leaving the Permanent Defence Force and qualifying for gratuity and pension.</P>
