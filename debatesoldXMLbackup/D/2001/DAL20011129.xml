      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter of grave urgency: to ensure the Minister for Foreign Affairs makes a statement and answers questions on such actions as Ireland, in its own right and as a member of the UN Security Council, proposes to take to ensure compliance with the Geneva Convention in relation to prisoners in Afghanistan, their taking and protection; if the Security Council proposes to investigate the recent mass killings and if he has raised these matters with the participants in the conflict and those who support them.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>I, too, seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate this crucial matter: the need for the Government to immediately withdraw its support for the military campaign led by the United States and Britain in Afghanistan in response to the wholesale slaughter of prisoners by their allies in Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz in total contravention of the Geneva Convention; the need for the Government to explain why military personnel of an EU member state, namely, Britain, were instrumental with US personnel in directing the bloody massacre and complete extermination of hundreds of trapped prisoners in the Mazar-i-Sharif compound and the need to state clearly that the Irish people do not support these atrocities.</P>

      <P>Having considered the matter fully, I do not consider it to be in accordance with Standing Order 31. On the second topic, I received notice from Deputies McManus, <Col N="578" /> Gay Mitchell, Neville, Ring and Sargent. I call on Deputy McManus to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter of public interest requiring urgent attention: the serious implications for those on low incomes of the announcement by the Minister for Health and Children that there will not be any increase in income eligibility for medical cards for the year 2002 and the urgent need for the Government to review this decision. In view of the importance of this matter, I hope the Ceann Comhairle will accede to this request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter of national importance: the fact that 250,000 people continue to face financial barriers at the first point of contact with the health services and the failure of the Minister for Health and Children and the Government to extend medical card eligibility to these people which highlights the failure to recognise the importance of primary care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter of national importance: the report by the Irish Medical Organisation that 250,000 people cannot afford medical treatment and the Government's decision not to extend eligibility to medical cards to the most vulnerable citizens in society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) Nos. 24 and 24a, and subject to the agreement of No. 24a, Nos. 24b [Vote 32] and 25, shall be decided without debate and any division demanded on Nos. 24a, 24b and 25, shall be taken forthwith; (2) the Second and Remaining Stages of No. 1 shall be taken today and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) Second Stage to conclude at 12.30 p.m. if not previously concluded; (ii) the Remaining Stages to conclude at 1 p.m. if not previously concluded and the proceedings thereon to be brought to a conclusion by one question in each case which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs; and (iii) No. 26 shall be taken immediately upon the conclusion of No. 1 and shall be decided without debate.</P>

      <P>There are three proposals to be put to the House. The first is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 24, 24<i>a</i> and 24<i>b</i>. These are motions for the approval of the terms of the Treaty between the Government of Ireland and the United States of America on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters and the introduction of Supplementary Estimates. Is that agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may put this question? It will decide whether we divide the House. I understand Report Stage is to be taken on Tuesday and Wednesday next. The debate on Report Stage can only be based on matters raised on Commitee Stage and it is unlikely that the Official Report of the Commitee Stage debate will be printed by Tuesday. Before we decide on the matter before the House, can the Tánaiste assure the House that the full transcript of Committee Stage will be available before Report Stage commences, and adequate time be available for consideration of these matters before Report Stage amendments are required to be tabled?</P>

      <P>In the past week the Tánaiste made a statement that the Government would be unable to exempt all those on the minimum income from income tax in next week's budget. Last night we learned that the Government, despite all the wealth earned in the past few years, will be unable to give people with little more than half the minimum income a medical card.

Why has the Government reneged on its commitment to provide medical cards for the weakest and most vulnerable group in society?

    <Title>European Communities and Swiss Confederation Bill, 2001  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The European Communities and Swiss Confederation Bill, 2001, is a short, technical Bill, the main purpose of which is to give the force of law in the State, once they are ratified, to seven sectoral agreements which have been signed between the European Union and Switzerland. The Bill was published on 15 November last. It was introduced in the Seanad by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 21 November 2001, and it passed all stages in the other House on the same day.</P>
      <P>The seven agreements deal with the following areas: free movement of persons; air transport; rail and road transport; trade in agricultural products; mutual recognition in relation to conformity assessment; government procurement and scientific and technological co-operation.</P>
      <P>These agreements were all signed in Luxembourg on 21 June 1999 and they will enter into force when they are formally ratified or approved by all the parties to them. Switzerland ratified the seven agreements on 16 October 2000, following their approval in May of that year by the Swiss people in a popular referendum. At this stage, my understanding is that all of the EU member states, with the exception of Ireland and Belgium, have completed ratification procedures. I trust that with the approval of this House, Ireland will be able to ratify in the coming days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the seven agreements are separate and distinct, they are linked together in the sense that <Col N="598" /> they can only come into force together and they will all come to an end if any one of them is terminated. This was at the insistence of the EU, which felt that the seven agreements satisfied the interests of both sides only when taken and considered together as a complete package.</P>
    <P>The Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons differs in a significant way from the other six agreements in that it requires ratification by the fifteen member states of the EU as well as by the European Community and Switzerland. The reason for this is that it deals with matters which fall within the competence of individual member states. The other six agreements require formal ratification only on behalf of the European Community and Switzerland. However, as these include references to various EU directives and regulations which need to be adapted to take account of their application to Switzerland, the European Communities and Swiss Confederation Bill, 2001, will, when enacted, ensure that all the necessary adaptations required to give effect to them are made. The Bill is modelled on the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1993, which provided for the ratification of the European Economic Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>Because of Switzerland's strategic location in Europe, surrounded as it is on all sides by member states of the European Union it is both appropriate and necessary that relations between the EU and Switzerland should be close and harmonious and conducted on a sound legal footing. Such is the express wish and intention of the European Union, its member states and Switzerland. Switzerland is also very close to the European Union in cultural and economic terms. A multilingual country, three of the European Union's official languages are spoken within its borders.</P>
    <P>In international relations, Switzerland is a strong supporter of the key role of multilateral organisations, in particular through its participation in the OSCE and the Council of Europe. Like Ireland, Switzerland attaches importance to deepening international co-operation for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and crisis management, and joined the Partnership for Peace even before Ireland did.</P>
    <P>Next spring the Swiss people will again vote in a referendum on joining the United Nations. As an active observer in the United Nations and contributor to UN peacekeeping, and indeed as the host to the UN Geneva offices, the Swiss have made a long and honourable contribution to its work. As we in Ireland have shown, small states which have remained outside military alliances have an important contribution to make at all levels of the UN's work. We wish the Swiss people well in their consideration of these issues.</P>
    <P>In terms of trade, Switzerland is second only to the US as a market for EU exports. Swiss direct investment in the EU is also both valuable and important, second only to the US, while Switzerland is a major recipient of EU direct investment. Given its geographic location, its economic <Col N="599" /> strength and its cultural affinity with the countries of the EU, I would say that this is only to be expected.</P>
    <P>Switzerland is the country in Europe with the highest number of non-national EU residents with a population of over one million and it receives 95% of EU cross-border workers with 150,000 EU citizens crossing the Swiss border to work every morning. Therefore, as the EU's most important European partner, there is an obvious and mutual interest in promoting closer and more formal relations between the EU and Switzerland, for example, through the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the history books that while Switzerland had participated in the negotiations on the European Economic Area Agreement, the Swiss people subsequently voted in a referendum &ndash; as was their right &ndash; against participation in that agreement. As a consequence, the European Economic Area, with the accession of Sweden, Finland and Austria to the European Union in 1995, now consists of the 15 member states of the Union, together with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Another consequence of the referendum in Switzerland rejecting the European Economic Area Agreement was that, in addition to Switzerland not being able to participate in the EEA, its request for accession to the EU, which had been advanced in May 1992, had to be frozen. It remains so to this day, although the Swiss Government retains future EU membership as &ldquo;a strategic objective&rdquo; of Government policy.</P>
    <P>Bilateral relations between the EU and Switzerland are for now based on a number of existing agreements, including the 1972 Free Trade Agreement, a framework agreement on scientific and technical co-operation and a transit agreement. However, as both the EU and Switzerland recognised the need for a closer formal relationship, in their mutual interests, they proceeded to negotiate the seven additional sectoral agreements signed on 21 June 1999.</P>
    <P>When these agreements were being signed, both the EU and Switzerland made joint declarations indicating an interest in negotiating agreements in a number other important areas. Negotiations are now under way on co-operation against fraud, on the environment, co-operation on statistics and on an agreement for the liberalisation of trade in processed agricultural products. Further negotiations in areas, such as trade in services, participation in Community programmes on training, youth and media, on savings taxation and on co-operation in the area of justice and home affairs and on Swiss participation in areas covered by the Schengen Agreement are currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal briefly with the seven agreements which are the subject of this Bill, starting with the Agreement on Free Movement of Persons. This agreement will provide broadly for the free movement of persons between the EU and Switzerland. It aims for the granting on a recipro<Col N="600" /> cal basis of the same living, employment and working conditions as those enjoyed by the respective citizens. It covers rights of entry, residence, access to employment, the right of establishment on a self-employed basis, access to education and the right to benefit from reciprocal social security arrangements. It provides for the mutual recognition of educational qualifications and the co-ordination of social security systems. All these rights are based on the principles of non-discrimination by nationality and equality of treatment. The agreement affords Switzerland a transition period to facilitate the liberalisation of its labour market. This agreement is being concluded initially for a period of seven years and will be renewed indefinitely unless it is repudiated by either party.</P>
    <P>As far as the social security aspects of this agreement are concerned, Ireland already has a bilateral Social Security Agreement with Switzerland which came into force on 1 July 1999, after the signature of the Free Movement Agreement. The majority of persons covered by the Free Movement Agreement are already covered by the bilateral agreement although the benefits of the EU agreement will be more beneficial as short-term benefits and family benefits are included. The provisions relating to old age benefits are also more beneficial. However, having regard to the level of migration between Ireland and Switzerland, it is considered that the additional costs arising from the social security provisions of the Free Movement Agreement will be minimal. Irish citizens resident in Switzerland will benefit from similar arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Agreement on Air Transport provides essentially for the reciprocal liberalisation of aviation, on the basis of previous Community agreements. It covers air traffic rights for journeys between any point in the Community and any point in Switzerland for carriers registered in either party. Two years after the entry into force of the agreement Swiss air carriers will be granted traffic rights between points in different Community countries. Monitoring of compliance with this agreement, especially as regards the implementation of competition law, will be under the responsibility of the Commission and the European Court of Justice. In return, Switzerland will have observer status in the committees assisting the Commission to define the evolution of European air transportation policy. This agreement therefore creates a unified legal regime for air transportation based on strict reciprocity between rights and obligations conferred within the EU and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>We welcome this further liberalisation of air transport within Europe with Irish carriers benefiting by being granted greater access to operate air services between Switzerland and the EU. Swiss carriers will be granted reciprocal rights two years later.</P>
    <P>While dealing with matters concerning air transport, I should like to take the opportunity of expressing to the Swiss Government and to the <Col N="601" /> Swiss people the deep sympathy of the House following the accident involving a Crossair plane which was just about to land at Zurich Airport, which involved a number of fatalities last Saturday night.</P>
    <P>The Agreement on the Carriage of Goods and Passengers by Rail and Road deals, in particular, with the maintenance of the freedom of transit for road vehicles across Switzerland, at reasonable charges. The 28 tonne limit for trucks circulating in Switzerland will be progressively raised to 40 tonnes, the European standard. It provides for the avoidance of traffic diversion from Switzerland into neighbouring countries, the reciprocal liberalisation of bilateral and transit road transport operations, the adoption by Switzerland of legislation equivalent to specified elements of the road and rail transport <i>aquis communitaire</i>, with a timetable for the progressive adoption of Community rules on vehicle weights and dimensions, and compliance by Switzerland with Community rules on state aids to road transport. Liberalisation of transport of both persons and goods, as provided for in this agreement between the European Union and Switzerland is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Agreement on Trade in Agricultural Products is expected to improve significantly access for agricultural products to the EU and Swiss markets, respectively, while abolishing tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade according to the principle of reciprocity. A large number of tariff concessions have been granted for plants and flowers, fresh or prepared fruit and vegetables, cheeses and milk products, meat products and wine. The agreement also seeks to facilitate trade through mutual recognition of legislation on plant protection, animal feedstuffs, seeds and organic farming. It includes veterinary rules designed to facilitate trade in live animals and animal products. In the case of live animals the two sides' legislation is deemed to be equivalent and for animal products trade will be based on Community legislation. The agreement also provides that Switzerland will apply the same rules as the Community to imports from third countries.</P>
    <P>The proposed agreement will provide increased export opportunities for Ireland over a range of products. The section on trade in wines and sprits which provides for mutual protection of protected names, will afford protection for Irish denominations such as Irish Cream and Irish Whiskey.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Agreement on the Mutual Recognition of Conformity Assessment is to establish mutual recognition of the results of tests of conformity to standards for most industrial products. Both parties will thus recognise reports, certificates, authorisations and labels of certification delivered according to their respective procedures. The effect is that products can be certified by recognised conformity assessment bodies in the European Union and placed on the Swiss market without having to undergo any further approval procedures, and <i>vice versa</i>. This will result in reduced costs and increased efficiency for obtaining product approvals and will facilitate <Col N="602" /> market access. The agreement lists the various sectors to be covered, including machinery, toys, medical devices, telecommunications terminal equipment and a range of others.</P>
    <P>The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, has been notified under EU procedures as a conformity assessment body, CAB, for many of the sectors mentioned in the agreement and NSAI supports agreements such as this which lead to better mutual recognition of certificates of conformity.</P>
    <P>The Agreement on Certain Aspects of Government Procurement aims at ensuring harmony between the public procurement regimes of the European Union and Switzerland and to provide for greater reciprocal access to the public procurement markets. The agreement focuses only on certain aspects of public procurement as account has been taken of the already existing agreements in the framework of the WTO government procurement agreement. Overall, an almost complete reciprocal opening of the respective public procurement markets will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The agreement on scientific and technological co-operation will associate Switzerland with the EU's Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technology and Development and the corresponding Fifth Framework Programme of EURATOM. Until now, research bodies established in Switzerland have only been able to participate in these research programmes on a project by project basis and without the possibility of launching a research project of their own. Under this agreement they will be allowed to take part on an equal footing with their EU partners. In addition, research bodies in the EU will in future be able to participate in research programmes and projects in Switzerland. The financial contribution by Switzerland to the budget of the research programme will be based on the ratio of Switzerland's GDP to that of the member states of the European Union. The agreement will allow scientists and researchers in Ireland increased opportunities to co-operate with their Swiss colleagues, opportunities which I sincerely hope they will avail of to the fullest extent. The number of EU research projects with Irish and Swiss involvement stands at about 60 projects.</P>
    <P>All seven agreements will be supervised by joint committees, at which decisions will be taken by unanimity. The joint committees will only have decision-making powers if this is expressly stated in a particular agreement. Each party is responsible for the application of the agreement in its own territory.</P>
    <P>I turn to the provisions of the Bill. Section 1(1) is a standard feature defining &ldquo;the Act of 1972&rdquo; as meaning the European Communities Act, 1972. It lists the formal titles of the seven agreements. Section 1(2) is also a standard provision which will enable the 1972 Act to be read as including any amendments that have been made to that Act between 1972 and 2001.</P>
    <P>Section 2 amends section 2 of the European Communities Act, 1972, by inserting a new sub<Col N="603" /> section, after section 2(2) of that Act. The new section provides that from the coming into force of the seven agreements between the EU and Switzerland, their provisions and the Acts to be adopted by any institution established by the agreements will be binding on the State and they will have the force of law in the State. The section of the Bill, when enacted, will enable the European Communities Act, 1972, to be used for the future development of the seven agreements and, depending on the precise terms of any development under the agreement on the free movement of persons, for the future development of that agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 3 will have the effect of converting all existing instruments, for instance, EU directives and regulations listed in the seven agreements, which currently only apply to EU member states, to apply to Switzerland. Section 4 is a standard feature which gives the short title to the Bill, the collective citation, and provides for a commencement order to be made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>When these agreements enter into force, they will constitute an important step in the development of formal relations between the EU and Switzerland and will form the basis for the future development of relations to the mutual benefit of both sides. I hope Ireland will use the provisions of the agreements to promote more bilateral contacts. The agreements will certainly provide opportunities to do so. I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to Deputies' contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My sole criticism of the Bill is that it has taken the Government so long to bring it before the House. I welcome the arrangements that have been made with Switzerland and I am delighted that we are honoured by the presence of the Swiss ambassador, who is keeping an eye on us to ensure we complete the ratification procedures. This debate should have taken place a long time ago given that all the agreements were signed in Luxembourg two and a half years ago. Why is Ireland at the end of the queue in terms of completing its ratification procedures? That sends the wrong signal to the EU and to our friends in Switzerland.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State admitted in his contribution that the only other laggards in the proceedings are the Belgians and it must be borne in mind that they have particular difficulties because of their parliamentary structure, which involves regional Parliaments, and the complicated ratification procedures they must undergo. We have no such complaints and we have not done our relationships with the EU or the Swiss any good by being at the end of the queue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How important is our relationship with Switzerland? As I undertook research in preparation for the debate I was surprised at how extensive is Ireland's relationship with Switzerland. Everybody is aware of the historic relationship between the two countries whereby Irish monks estab<Col N="604" /> lished monasteries in Switzerland long ago but in recent times this relationship has been more remunerative from Ireland's point of view. Ireland's trade with Switzerland is absolutely enormous. Switzerland is our 12th largest trading partner, tenth largest export market and fourth largest non-EU trading partner behind the US, Japan and Singapore. Our trade with Switzerland this year will amount to almost £2 billion, which is an enormous sum.</P>
    <P>We should have taken steps much sooner to complete the ratification of these agreements in the context of good relations with such a major trading nation. It must be borne in mind that a referendum was held on them in Switzerland and, subsequently, they were ratified, but this took place more than a year and a half ago. It is of no credit to us in terms of the significant trading relationship Ireland has with Switzerland that the Government has dallied for so long before bringing the legislation before the House. The balance of trade is 5:1 in our favour, which means that Switzerland is a large export market for us but it is not only in terms of trade that we should be more careful about our relationship with the Swiss.</P>
    <P>However, the Swiss will hope, as a result of these agreements, to further penetrate our markets, and more luck to them as they are entitled to do so. Almost 30 companies are based in Ireland employing approximately 2,500 people while almost 60,000 Swiss tourists visit Ireland every year. I offer a genuine, sincere céad míle fáilte on behalf of the Opposition to the Swiss Government and its people. I assure them that whatever about the delays on the part of Government, there will be no delay on the part of the Opposition in ensuring the Bill is passed speedily so that Ireland can join with the other EU member states in ratifying the agreements.</P>
    <P>As far as the Swiss are concerned the agreements are a step on the road to their strategic objective, which is membership of the EU. I very much look forward to the day the Swiss Confederation becomes a member of the EU. Enlargement of the EU, which involves the accession of 12 new states, will take place in the near future. The accession negotiations have been accelerated and will be agreed, subject to Ireland not holding them up, before the end of next year. At that stage, Switzerland will be completely surrounded by the EU.</P>
    <P>I am aware it takes an historic approach of individuality and neutrality dating back to the 16th century. However, the world moves on and there is a gathering lobby in Switzerland to bring the country into the European Union. I would like the message to go from the Dáil to the Swiss people that they will be encouraged in every way to aim towards membership of the European Union. I hope the Government will send a clear signal that Ireland is in favour of enlargement, both immediate enlargement and enlargement down the line to include Switzerland. I appreciate <Col N="605" /> there was a development recently in relation to a referendum on the issue in Switzerland. It was not supported by the main political parties at the time because it was considered to be premature. I hope there will be a referendum in the future which will allow Switzerland join the European Union.</P>
    <P>This raises the question as to whether Ireland will welcome that. We on the Opposition benches want to send a signal of welcome to the Swiss by building on these agreements which we are now ratifying. It will encourage the Swiss to develop their pro-European Union approach and help them in their strategic objective of joining the Union. The Government must ensure there is a clear signal from Ireland that we are in favour of enlargement of the European Union. I have no doubt the failure of the Government last June to get the Nice referendum through sent a directly contrary signal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have burnt up our political credit in Europe because of the failure of the Government to get the Nice referendum through. It will be extremely detrimental to our long-term standing in the European Union, particularly throughout Central and Eastern Europe, if we are responsible for delaying the enlargement process or making it more difficult. It now seems likely we will end up in a minority of one next year, being the only member state of the Union that has not ratified the Nice Treaty. That will put us in the most difficult and exposed position ever in the European <Col N="606" /> Union. We will be isolated, out in the margins and exposed. The reason for that is the continuing failure of the Government to do anything about the Nice Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke about participating. Participating in what? Does he mean participating in a circus in Dublin Castle which exists solely as a camouflage to cover the fact that the Government will do, and has done, nothing about its failure to put through the Treaty of Nice?</P>

      <P>I will deal with the issue on the basis of the view of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who unfortunately is not here today. As far as I am aware, he is shaking hands with the Pope today and, given the upcoming election, he will want his blessing. I wish he were here. He had to deal last week with the confusion of the circus in Dublin Castle by making a strong statement in the Seanad. He condemned the Nice Treaty confusion which emanated from the castle &ndash;<i>The Irish Times</i> of 22 November. He had to go on record in the Seanad to condemn what was happening in the castle in regard to the misinformation being disseminated. He focused in particular on the statement of the Danish MEP, Jens Peter Bonde, who was still seeking to imply that accession of the new members could take place under the Treaty of Amsterdam, that there was no need for the Treaty of Nice. It is ridiculous that a platform is being given to people who are so anti-European that they are prepared to spread misinformation in the circus created by the Government in Dublin Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saying to the Government, let us send out a proper signal in regard to enlargement. Let the Government be prepared to show leadership on this issue. Rather than referring it to a talk shop or sub-committee, I demanded from the Taoiseach yesterday &ndash; I had hoped to present it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs today, but the Minister of State will no doubt pass on my demand &ndash; the Government's plan or programme as to what it will do about the Treaty of Nice. The Taoiseach accepted in the Dáil yesterday that there is no question of the Treaty of Nice being renegotiated. He accepts there must be another referendum. I imagine he accepts, as does Fine Gael, that there cannot be just a replay of the same match. That presupposes that steps will have to be taken and measures put in place before the next referendum. We must bear in mind the timeframe. If these measures are not <Col N="607" /> taken now we will not be in a position to have the referendum on time, and the consequences will be dire. The worst case scenario is that we will be the only member state holding up enlargement. That is the grim scenario which confronts us because of the failure of leadership on the part of the Government and its failure to put forward any coherent set of proposals on this issue.</P>

      <P>As I wish to allow time for Deputy Durkan perhaps we will both have to stand aside.</P>
      <P>May I just complete the point I am making on this issue of enlargement because it is quite important? I want to get away from party politics. The Fine Gael Party has set out its proposals on its view of the future of Europe and what should be done following the failure of the Government to have the Nice treaty ratified. It is a 40 page document containing a six point programme of action for consultation purposes. I saw criticism of our plan which said it was too prescriptive. Of course we have set out what we think should be done. It may not be the last word but where is the Government's plan? I do not want the Minister of State to say that a forum has been set up. That is the typical example of a gang who do not know what to do and who will refer it to a sub-committee and do nothing. I plead with the Government to avail of the expertise available in the Department, the Institute of European Affairs and the universities &ndash; where some excellent papers have been written. They should put together a programme of action which we can debate and begin to implement so that we will be able to return to the people in good time with a new approach on the treaty. I make that plea in the national interest. Do not tell me that the circus in Dublin Castle will produce that. The only people who can produce a programme for the Government is the Government itself. I demand that it be produced without further delay. It has been six months since their failure on the Nice treaty.</P>
      <P>Switzerland is welcome as regards these agreements. I am glad we are ratifying them at long last. I hope to welcome Switzerland as a full member of the European Union in the not too distant future. I heartily endorse this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As with my colleague Deputy O'Keeffe, I welcome this legislation. I am glad to note the presence of our good friend, the Swiss Ambassador, who campaigned strongly to have the legislation brought to this point. I am sorry it took from June 1999 until now to bring this legislation forward. It is far too long for the institutions either within or associated with the EU to react. This being one of them does not bode well for the future.</P>
      <P>This is effectively a treaty of the Union with a country that is surrounded by the EU and where it is deemed by both sides to be impossible to exist without each other. There is a lesson for Ireland in that too. In recent years we have seen marches against the global economy all around the world. They suggested that smaller countries would be swamped by the global economy and could not exist. In reality the opposite is the case. The smaller the country in a tariff ridden market the more vulnerable it is. A small country with a small economy, surrounded by larger neighbours, cannot exist in a tariff protected market. It is the reverse of what has been suggested by those involved in the protest marches. I have never heard anyone propose a reasonable suggestion to the contrary. It always follows that if a country is dealing with a powerful neighbour which has access to and reliance on tariffs to protect their trade, they will win out. I cannot understand how this argument has been regurgitated in recent years. It is extremely important for all small countries with small economies to recognise that the existence of tariffs and barriers to free trade is the biggest obstacle that they face. It is lethal as far as small countries are concerned.</P>
      <P>I am glad we are having this kind of debate in the House. The Committee on European Affairs has done its best to generate debate on European issues and we meet on a weekly basis. Unfortunately this House does not involve itself sufficiently in debates that involve European trade, politics, cohesion or anything else. That has been remiss of us and we have paid the price for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's reservation about what Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has said, I do not know if it is fully understood the serious position Ireland finds itself in <i>vis-à-vis</i> Nice and our involvement with the EU. Switzerland is surrounded by the EU but Ireland is on the periphery and anything we do or say that causes further isolation is a serious matter and will have serious consequences for the country, its people and its economy. We can be as aloof as we like and stand apart from the European Union and criticise it but as long as we distance ourselves from it we are creating circumstances that could very well come back to haunt us. I hope the tiger economy we have experienced does not become the instrument whereby we become arrogant to the extent where we think we can exist without the Union. We cannot and we had better realise that. The European institutions need to realise one or two things as well. The Union comprises a group of nations with different traditions, backgrounds <Col N="609" /> and histories. The institutions must keep that it mind whenever negotiations of this nature take place. Failure to do so will result in a repeat of the debacle we had on the referendum on the Treaty of Nice. Any repeat of that will have serious long-term consequences for Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that work to date has done nothing to address the issues that were raised. I know the Minister will point to the forum and say that debate exists there. Several representatives of the applicant countries, and some from Union member states, have attended the forum and are deeply concerned at what they have seen and heard. The fundamental issues that should have been debated in the run up to the referendum are not taking place now. The issues are not being addressed. If we fudge the issues, avoid them or move away from them, we would be running away from our responsibilities. Responsibility rests in the first instance, not with the Opposition who are doing their best, but with the Government. Unfortunately that is the way it is.</P>
    <P>The nearer we get to the final date for ratification of the Treaty of Nice the more serious it becomes from Ireland's point of view. Time is fast running out. By the middle of next year a general election will have taken place and there will be no further progress on the debate on the treaty between now and then. The time for debate between then and the end of the year &ndash; which is the deadline for ratification &ndash; will be extremely limited. I do not think it can happen. We are now seen by other member states as holding up progress towards integration and that is a serious matter. We await the debate at Laeken but that will not resolve our problems because I do not think it will be sufficiently wide ranging to give some kind of assistance to pro Europeans.</P>
    <P>Where we have failed is in the institutions in this country. It is all very well saying that 90% of the political system was in favour of the Treaty of Nice and was pro-European. That is not enough. It gives them too much latitude and a <i>cause célèbre</i> with which to exploit the argument from the opposite side.</P>
    <P>One of the issues that has hamstrung the Irish position is the over-reliance on the issue of neutrality, which was the least important issue. The real critical issues were the three or four other main ones raised during the debate on the Treaty of Nice. These will have a much more significant impact on our way of life and the future evolution of Europe and Ireland's participation in it.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Government and everybody in this country recognises that participation in Europe is not an opt in or opt out situation. It is not a case of cherry-picking where we can pick the good parts and walk away from our responsibilities. It is something we all have a commitment to contribute to. If we do not do so as readily as expected, the institution will fall. I support the proposal and I welcome a similar response in relation to our addressing the issue of the Treaty of Nice.</P>

      <P>I join other Members in welcoming Ambassador Pfister to the House. He has been anxious that this legislation should go through the House, as was his predecessor, Ambassador Hold, who raised the issue with many of us during his term of office.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have contributed to this Second Stage debate on the European Communities and Swiss Confederation Bill, 2001. I am grateful for the support expressed from all sides, which reflects the desire on all our parts to take the steps necessary to ensure the further development of close and harmonious relationships between the European Union and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>It will remain a matter for the Swiss people to decide how they wish to conduct their future relations with the European Union. Because of its geographical location at the heart of the EU, its cultural affinity with the member states and its status as a highly developed market economy, we in the EU should take all steps necessary to ensure that at every level they progress both efficiently and effectively. The seven sectoral agreements covered by this Bill will significantly contribute to this aim when they come into force next year.</P>
      <P>Negotiations between the EU and Switzerland on future agreements in other sectors such as co-operation against fraud, on the environment, statistics, liberalisation of trade and on processed agricultural products are already under way. In addition, consideration has been given to negotiations in different areas such as trade and services, Swiss participation in Community programmes on training, issues concerning youth and media, savings and taxation and on the important area of justice and home affairs. I trust that negotiations in all areas will yield fruitful results, of benefit to both sides.</P>
      <P>Had Switzerland decided to participate in the European Economic Area together with the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, almost all the contents of the seven agreements discussed and the likely content of future agreements would have already applied to Switzerland. The democratic decision of the Swiss people was not to participate in the EEA. Therefore, rather than regretting what might have been, we should work together to achieve the best results for everyone in the EU and in Switzerland.</P>
      <P>The Government hopes that the new agreements will lead to further strengthening of bilateral relations between Ireland and Switzerland. Very few, if any, problems exist between us in any event. I see greater opportunities for trade &ndash; where Ireland already enjoys a favourable balance &ndash; for the development of tourism and for promoting contacts between universities and research institutes as a consequence of these agreements. I am confident that the Swiss Government and people share that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to the question about the delay in bringing this Bill forward, it was originally intended to bring forward the necessary legislat<Col N="611" /> ive provisions to enable Ireland to ratify the agreement on the free movement of persons in the context of the Immigration Carriers Liability Bill which has been proposed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The expectation was that this would be published in mid-2001 and that it would progress through the Oireachtas in good time to allow Ireland to ratify the agreement along with the other EU states before the end of this year. However, given the expected timetable for that legislation, it became clear that it was unlikely to be passed in time to allow Ireland meet the target date for ratification. We decided, in consultation with the Attorney General's office and other Government Departments, that the best course was to prepare a separate Bill modelled on the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1993, which provided for the ratification of the European Economic Area agreement ensuring that necessary adaptation required to give effect to the agreement would be made.</P>
    <P>We are not the last country to ratify this. The Netherlands and Germany have done so only in recent weeks and France and Belgium have yet to do so. We are still reflecting on the results of the Treaty of Nice referendum. The reasons for its defeat are many and varied. Most of them had little to do with the treaty itself but reflected wider concerns. Through the forum on Europe, we have launched a national debate on Europe.</P>
    <P>It was abundantly clear from the low turnout in the referendum and from the Commission survey that there is a need for a mature and wide-ranging debate. We welcome Fine Gael's proposals. I believe they are concrete and I believe the party is committed to the whole idea of Europe and its enlargement as well as the way we move forward, as is Fianna Fáil. I hope and believe it will emerge that it is in our national interest to be active and committed members of the EU. This is true for our economy, society and our interests as a small country in a globalising and uncertain world.</P>
    <P>It has already emerged in the forum that there is continuing support for enlargement which is in our economic and political interests and is the right thing to do. If enlargement is to proceed on schedule, the Treaty of Nice will have to be ratified by the end of 2002. We are determined to find a way forward that will make this possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will extend the meaning of the word &ldquo;interpretations&rdquo; to allow me interpret <Col N="612" /> a few of the comments made by the Minister of State in his closing address. I note that the delay in bringing the Bill forward was caused by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who has been in the wars this week. This was because of the original decision to allow the ratification procedures to be included in a Bill being brought forward by him and as usual there was a delay on his part in doing so. I am glad that the issue has been taken forward by the Department of Foreign Affairs and that we are not now delaying ratification any further.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could resolve a point for me. I understood until recently that the Belgians and the French were holding things up. The Minister has now mentioned other member states. When I spoke about Belgium earlier, I was referring to the Minister's speech in which he said:</P>
      <P>My understanding is that all of the EU member states with the exception of Ireland and Belgium have completed ratification procedures.</P>
      <P>I am not going to fall out over the issue as to whether a country has ratified in the last week or two. As a general principle, it is not in Ireland's interests to be tardy in dealing with EU matters. We have gained much from our membership.</P>
      <P>Because of the failure of the referendum on the Treaty of Nice, we have sent a very negative signal throughout Europe. We have burnt much of our credit and we should now be trying to undo the damage that has been done and redevelop that credit. It is in that context that I am concerned about the delay. I would have been appalled if we had been the ones holding up the ratification of the agreements with Switzerland. We should have been at the forefront rather than at the bottom. I would be utterly appalled if Ireland were the country holding up ratification of the agreements with Switzerland. We should have been among the first to do it rather than being at the bottom of the league. It is in that context that I spoke.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has had the good grace to acknowledge and welcome the Fine Gael proposal on the Treaty of Nice. I reply, hopefully with the same good grace, that I would welcome Government proposals on the issue &ndash; a programme of action. That is what I have been demanding. One of the reasons that, with advisers, I went to the trouble of producing this document was to encourage a response from the Government. Merely telling me that there is something happening in that circus at the Castle is not a response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government genuinely has a duty to provide leadership. It is a duty which has been ignored. It may be because there are divisions &ndash; I know that different strands exist but I will not go over that now. I ask that the message be passed on to the Government to put forward its proposals. We will give them a fair hearing. I doubt that, in the end, there will be a whole range of differences between my proposals and the Government's, but the sooner we get going the <Col N="613" /> better. I am happy with the interpretations that are in the Bill and I am prepared to agree section 1.</P>

      <P>This is effectively an EU treaty. It paves the way for eventual membership of the EU. It is also a recognition of the inability of a state to exist within the Union on its own. There is a salutary lesson there for us.</P>
      <P>This section sets out, in various stages, what the Bill is all about. It intends to unify the thinking within the EU and within Switzerland itself. I cannot understand why we did not do this a year ago. There was no reason for not ratifying it then. If it is necessary, it is necessary to do it quickly. There was nothing to stop us &ndash; it was not as though we needed a referendum. We could have had it over and done with in Parliament. If Parliament is not seen, outside, as recognising the urgency of complying with certain requirements or agreements of the EU, how in heaven's name can we expect the general public to react positively? This is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no problem with any part of section 1; we know what it amounts to and we accept and agree with it. We do have a problem with the length of time it took to get here, for no reason at all. It was not as though we were so badly pressed for time &ndash; we could have sat on a Friday if we had wanted to. In the context of this section, perhaps in the future we could accord debate of this nature its proper place in the parliamentary calendar. We should seriously consider having debates on Fridays in the normal course of <Col N="614" /> events. How else is the House of Parliament to keep in touch with its requirements as set out under this agreement and similar agreements, whether they be with member states on a bilateral basis or with the EU or treaties that are now contemplated?

We need to generate debate on that subject, bringing it to the attention of the people, including the people of Switzerland, on whose behalf this agreement has been reached.</P>
      <P>I hope that this agreement or similar agreements with other countries, either within or without the Union, is not seen by some as the answer to all our prayers. I hope we can have a loose arrangement with the EU that can be as flexible as it needs to be at any time and that we can move to the right or to the left or opt out altogether as befits the occasion, to meet political requirements at particular times with the member states. I hope that this agreement is not seen by some who are negatively disposed towards Europe as a way out for them.

Perhaps that is the proper step on the road to membership. The reason this Bill is before the House today is that the Union could not complete this agreement &ndash; one of the seven that was negotiated as mixed competence &ndash; without ratification by the individual member states. If there are further such agreements of mixed competence between the Union and the member states, will the Government of the day &ndash; hopefully led by Fine Gael &ndash; be able to ratify them without having to come back to Parliament for further legislation?</P>

      <P>This section is of importance. I presume that we, the Swiss authorities and the European Union will adhere to the spirit and the letter of the agreement. Currently, some member states ignore specific clauses in agreements of this nature when it suits them. I do not wish to go into the minutiae of that now as there are some cases before the European Courts but there is no sense in entering into an agreement unless both sides intend to keep to the letter of the law. I can think of one or two larger countries which have been party to similar agreements in the past and selectively decided to ignore them. That is completely in breach of the bilateral agreement and of European law. Yet by virtue of their alleged influence within the Union, some countries decided to ignore that. I fully expect that everyone who is party to this will keep to the letter and spirit of the agreement. Otherwise we tend to bring the agreement and the institutions involved into disrepute. I strongly emphasise that point from previous experience.</P>

In addition, the six sectoral agreements other than the agreement on free movement refer to other EU directives and regulations whose domestic implementation requires to be adapted to give effect to the agreements. To ensure that all the necessary adaptations required to give effect to the agreement are made in the State, the safest course is to provide for a general adaptation provision.

I hope he takes account of the point I made regarding the previous section and compliance among all states as that is how the loophole opened up in the first place. If a particular country decides that it is repugnant to some other Act or agreement and that the proper course of action is for them to do nothing, that is the worst of all possible options.

      <P>Last night I said that enforcement alone was clearly not enough to change behaviour on the roads. I also agreed with Deputy Brendan Smith that there appears to be a waste of Garda manpower and time in relation to traffic matters when more serious issues could be dealt with, such as violent crime and thuggery in built-up areas.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to assess the impact of the media on public attention regarding road safety. Despite very graphic television advertising the message does not seem to be getting across to a huge number of people. In such situations people often turn to the education system to deliver and teachers feel everything of this nature is dumped unfairly on schools.</P>
      <P>There is a substantial difficulty in getting the message across and ensuring that whatever advertising or enforcement is in place does not just have a short-term impact. It should have a long-term impact and appreciably improve the behaviour of drivers and other road users. Any visitor to the National Rehabilitation Hospital will be aware of the serious injuries inflicted on people.</P>
      <P>While statisticians and the media most frequently direct attention to road deaths, the injury rate from traffic accidents is another unfortunate aspect of this issue. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, referred to the matter in his introductory speech on Tuesday. Each year many people suffer long-term physical injuries, such as brain damage, which gives rise to huge health costs. An enormous level of dependence is created and many people are consigned to the role of carer.</P>
      <P>It may be difficult to attain the goal of a 20% reduction in the level of deaths and injuries during the five years of the national road safety strategy. The Minister pointed out, however, that there has been a 12% drop in deaths and a 25% fall in serious injuries since 1997, which proves that it is possible to reach the plan's targets. I welcome the fact that this Bill will help to meet the strategy's aims.</P>
      <P>Section 20 of the Bill provides for the use of cameras and appears to strengthen legal provisions to that end. It is a great pity that modern technology, including cameras, may lead to constitutional and legal problems relating to the role of the courts and the rights of individuals. Many technological developments could have an enormous impact on road safety. The use of speed cameras, for example, could lead to a reduction in the manpower required to enforce speed regulations. Progress was made by requiring that lorries have tachographs. We have to provide such technology and enable it to impact more appreciably in the years to come if we are serious about reducing the number of road deaths and injuries. We have to face up to the challenge thrown down by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in relation to random breath testing. If we are reluctant to accept the challenge, it will prove that we are reluctant to grapple with the difficulties in relation to road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the long overdue national driver file <Col N="618" /> which will facilitate the recording of penalty points, disqualifications and other such matters. Similarly, I am glad that the maximum fine has been substantially increased from £150 to 800. Deputies are aware, however, that there have been difficulties in relation to the collection of fines. The provision in the Bill of a 50% increase in a fine if it is not paid by the due date will help to allay concerns regarding fines. We will have to be much more proactive in addressing such concerns.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill facilitates the ratification of the European Convention on Driving Disqualification. A disproportionate number of the driving errors I encounter while driving to the west are made by drivers of cars with foreign number plates, usually from the United Kingdom. It is difficult to follow up such cases. I welcome the Bill's provision of an increased role for local authorities, although we need to go further in that regard.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 of the Bill place onerous responsibilities on the registered owners of vehicles and I am not sure if these provisions will stand the tests of constitutionality and natural justice. As I understand it, in the absence of a named driver, the registered owner of a vehicle will be responsible for offences said to have been committed by the driver of the vehicle. While there are good reasons for introducing this measure, I anticipate difficulties. I welcome the structures of quality control for driving instructors, as introduced in this Bill, and the written test which commenced recently. Such measures should have a positive impact on driving standards. I welcome the Road Traffic Bill, 2001.</P>

      <P>One of the great freedoms given to Irish people is to be allowed to drive on public roads, to travel from point to point. The freedom is accompanied by a responsibility, however, which has been challenged on thousands of occasions. The Road Traffic Bill, 2001, attempts to manage traffic and uphold the rights of citizens to drive vehicles and travel throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I have been involved in three car crashes, two of which were related to speed. The third accident occurred when I had to aim for a wall to avoid a child. Nobody other than myself was injured in these incidents. I have often reflected on the truly terrifying moment before my vehicle went through the stone wall. There was a great deal of noise and a terrible fear of impending serious injury and possible death. It was truly a frightening experience. A crash can be a salutary lesson for those unfortunate enough to be party to a serious accident, either on their own or involving others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When driving between Mayo and Dublin each week in the course of my duties as a public representative, I observe the difference between fast driving, dangerous driving and reckless driving. I can understand why so many tragedies occur and why an increasing number of people die or are <Col N="619" /> seriously injured each year. I welcome the introduction of this Bill as an attempt to educate drivers. I support the Minister's endeavours to help motorists understand that the Bill serves their interests. I have a number of thoughts that warrant further comment.</P>
    <P>While this is a fine Bill, I must point out that the standard of road engineering in Ireland contributes to the number of serious accidents. There is a huge variety of roads in this country, including motorways, dual carriageways, wide two lane roads, narrow two lane roads and what one might call ordinary roads. There are many right hand turns on recently built two lane roads. It may be that an island has been placed on the road to guide drivers turning right or that white lines have been marked. I have often indicated that my car is about to turn right and waited in the centre of the road, but was unable to move because of oncoming traffic. I have experienced the sensation of cars passing on my left hand side at between 60 and 100 m.p.h. Inadequate engineering contributes to accidents that take place in such circumstances. Motorists in the line of traffic behind me are unable to see that my car is stopped in the middle of the road and is waiting to turn right. If a motorist attempts to pass out a car, a serious accident can result. I do not understand why the responsibility of the National Roads Authority in terms of engineering standards to be met when building roads is not clearly defined. Statistics show that many minor and more serious accidents occur because of the problem of right-hand turns from new roads. This is an engineering problem which this Bill cannot address.</P>
    <P>A penalty points system should have been introduced long ago and I support the Bill's measures in this regard. The Bill includes a long list of offences for which one can accrue a penalty point. However, the use of mobile telephones while driving is not included as should be the case. This practice may be included under negligent driving or whatever, but tens of thousands of people break this legislation every hour. One sometimes sees a driver looking under the dashboard trying to dial a telephone number or to talk while driving. Such drivers are in a different world and this careless behaviour should be a stated offence for which one receives a penalty point. I have seen drivers of cars, lorries and buses speaking on telephones or dialling numbers while indicating to turn right or left or passing out other vehicles. A fatal accident occurred in England while a truck driver was sending a text message on a mobile telephone. This kind of behaviour is very common.</P>
    <P>I support the provisions in the Bill regarding drink driving, the breathalysing of those involved in accidents and random breathalysing by the Garda. However, driving while under the influence of drugs should be an equally serious offence. There is an insidious network whereby <Col N="620" /> drugs are freely available in every town, parish and village. Anyone looking for drugs does not have to travel too far. In some cases up to 90% of young people at parties may be using cannabis or whatever. I do not know much about the drugs business, but I am sure that if drug use is that prevalent, many people must be driving while under the influence of drugs. This should be regarded as being as serious an offence as drink driving.</P>
    <P>The efforts made by the Garda and successive Governments are paying dividends in that it is becoming a social sin to sit behind the wheel of a vehicle while drunk. That is as it should be, and this campaign must not be lessened as new drivers are constantly coming on stream.</P>
    <P>One of the nicest things about driving is that when one is stopped by a garda and one is fully compliant with all aspects of the law, this justifies all one has done in terms of insurance, tax, road worthiness of the vehicle and looking after one's physical and mental well-being while behind the wheel. However, I am sure it is a sobering thought, to use a pun, for those who are apprehended to find the long arm of the law taking them to task for being in breach of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that most serious accidents occur within the first six to eight weeks after a driver passes the driving test. This fact may be due to over-confidence on the part of the driver as a result of passing the test whereby he or she feels free to drive in whatever way he or she sees fit. There is a need for a continuing reminder that passing the driving test is only the start of a career in driving and that one should adhere to this principle for the duration of one's driving life.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that the driving test is not what it should be. I welcome the introduction of the theory test. However, the driving test which involves a 20 or 30 minute drive around the town and which the applicant will have gone over many times with his or her driving instructor does not provide any experience of driving. Poor driving conditions and the onset of dark evenings mean it is a very different experience to drive at 5 p.m. than at 10 a.m. This is particularly the case if weather conditions are bad.</P>
    <P>An eye sight test should be a compulsory part of the driving test which should also include some night driving. Almost all those who sit the test will have to drive at night at some point. It is a different story once drivers gain experience, but in addition to the theory test and the other questions one is asked, an eye sight test and an element of night driving should form part of a comprehensive driving test.</P>
    <P>The changes which have taken place in the past ten years pose significant difficulties for elderly people who have been driving for many years. The changes in roads structures, the introduction of roundabouts and the increased volume of traffic can make elderly people very nervous. While they may have been, and probably are, careful drivers, the traffic gives rise to pressure and concerns on their part.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> The Minister, Deputy Molloy, will agree that if I left unlit concrete blocks on the road outside my house overnight, I could be convicted in a court as an accessory to manslaughter if someone died after crashing into them. The traffic calming measures introduced by the National Roads Authority are breath-taking. I will give the House an example. These measures are signalled by road signs outside towns and villages at the entrance to which traffic islands are installed. These islands usually consist of bricks surrounded by concrete barges which are supposed to include a lit arrow indicating that one should drive on the left. However, in many cases these islands are unlit and the grey concrete is impossible to see on a dark night. In every town and village these bollards have been demolished on more than one occasion by traffic crashing into them.</P>
    <P>When I drive to Castlebar from Dublin the first of these traffic islands I come across is in Enfield where the bollard has been demolished on more than one occasion. The two bollards are gone in Ballinalack and the same is the case in Rathowen and Charlestown. The traffic island in Ballyvary outside Castlebar comprises 27 traffic cones and sandbags surrounded by unlit cones. This has been the case since last March. I wrote to the NRA three times about this situation, yet I did not even receive the courtesy of a reply.</P>
    <P>This kind of engineering standard is lethal and contributes to serious accidents. I do not say this lightly as I wish to offer the Minister of State an alternative. The warning signs are fine but the traffic islands should be completely removed. This should be done on a pilot basis. There should be a warning that one is entering what might be called a red sector or a red speed zone whereby the first 100 metres of road leading into a town are sprayed red, such as in the case of pedestrian crossings. A red line should be put down the centre of the road until the exit point where there should again be 100 metres of red tar spray. Cameras could be erected and any driver who breaks the speed limit in the red sector should suffer a severe penalty, gaining four or five penalty points.</P>
    <P>Concrete bollards in the centre of main roads when they are not lit and cannot be seen, even during the day, contribute to serious road accidents. I make this proposal as a serious alternative. These traffic islands are often found 500 or 600 yards outside towns or villages and drivers entering the town tend to speed up when they leave these chicanes and drive even faster than when they entered them.</P>
    <P>Thousands of drivers do not adhere to speed limits on ring roads around towns. I have been guilty of breaking the speed limit and I have been fined for doing so. However, there is a difference between travelling at 70 miles per hour on a dual carriageway and doing so on a country road. Every tin box with four wheels is now capable of travelling at 100 miles per hour and in some social circles it is common to speak about cars which can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in <Col N="622" /> five seconds or can travel at 130 miles per hour. This happens despite our many speed limits.</P>
    <P>How many different speed limits does one encounter on the road from Dublin to Cork? The limits vary between 20, 30, 50, 60 and 70 miles per hour. Even experienced drivers often do not know the speed limit as they drive on a particular stretch of road because they are not certain whether they are driving on a wide two-lane road, a two-lane road, a dual carriageway, a motorway or a bypass. Speed limit signage is very unclear.</P>
    <P>There should be a dedicated highway patrol, principally of gardaí on motorcycles. Invariably one finds a driver travelling in the middle of the road at 45 miles per hour and holding up 40 or 50 vehicles. In such a situation a driver may decide to take a chance, overtake the slow driver and be caught out. A highway patrol officer could instruct the slow driver that if he wants to drive slowly he is entitled to do so but that other road users should be enabled to travel a little faster, while remaining within the speed limit. Most truck drivers pull over to allow a faster vehicle to pass and the practice of flashing lights as a thank-you sign appears to have caught on.</P>
    <P>The practice of leaving parking lights on while driving during daylight is a good one because it helps visibility. A dedicated highway or main road patrol to assist the freer movement of traffic and driver education is an idea worth considering. One often finds a Garda patrol car driving just under the speed limit with no driver prepared to overtake it. One might drive behind such a patrol car from Ballaghaderreen to Mullingar but no driver will overtake it for fear of being pulled in.</P>
    <P>I welcome the transfer of responsibility for designated taxi ranks to local authorities. In my home town of Castlebar the urban district council approved a licence regime for taxis and the place is lit up every weekend by taxi signs. However, there are still no designated taxi parking areas and a great deal of tension exists between the gardaí and the taxi drivers because gardaí are obliged to move taxi drivers who park in places not designated for taxi purposes. This question has been on a merry-go-round between the urban district council, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the offices of the Commissioner of the Garda and the Attorney General for the past 12 months. It is now in the commissioner's office on its way back to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and I would be grateful if the Minister of State would hurry this matter along. It would be a source of great consolation to everyone if Castlebar Urban District Council could resolve this matter for Christmas.</P>

      <P>The public is agreed that this is essential legislation. When enacted, the Bill will have profound bearing on the future personal safety of all vehicle drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. The carnage which happens every day and night on our roads is an indictment of all citizens but it is a particular indictment of politicians <Col N="623" /> of all parties and successive Administrations that we have not done more to prevent the horrific injuries and loss of life.</P>
      <P>Of the 64,000 students who sat the leaving certificate this year, approximately 1,000 will not live to see their 25th birthday if current road fatality trends continue. Like Deputy Kenny, I have personal experience of a serious road accident. While no one was killed, it took three ambulances to remove the injured, including myself, to hospital. The crash was the most frightening experience of my life. I was a back seat passenger and our driver was stopped on the correct side of the road when we were hit by a vehicle travelling at about 70 miles per hour, whose driver was trying to overtake on a narrow road. The experience changed my approach to driving and will affect me for the rest of my life. It was a most horrific experience which I would not wish on anyone. We should take greater action in trying to prevent such accidents happening.</P>
      <P>It was good to hear Deputy Kenny speaking so positively about the Bill and putting forward suggestions for it. Political point-scoring never helped to resolve this issue and will not do so now. It may be that political sniping over the years helped to ensure the continuation of some of the bad practices involved. Last night I listened to an Opposition Deputy criticising the Government for taking so long to introduce the Bill and then going on to explain the constitutional difficulties attached to it. We have all indulged in that kind of nonsense over the years. Every Member has something to offer in solving this problem and we all have a responsibility to do our best to improve the situation on our roads. We owe it to the public to ensure that our criticisms are geared towards improving matters and not towards scoring political or personal points.</P>
      <P>A Minister who takes an initiative for change is seldom supported. Everyone lauds the introduction of the driving theory test but the knee-jerk reaction of some people at the time was to complain. In that case the measure was criticised because not all learner drivers on the waiting list were to be included under the regulations. The Minister was faced with two options. He could have satisfied the latter request and blocked up the whole system or he could have proceeded, at least with one positive requirement for the future. The Minister of State proceeded, thank God.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Co-operation is needed from all sources. Comparisons are often made between the number of people killed in the Northern troubles and those killed on our roads. The major difference between attitudes to the two situations is that people demanded and were willing to work at taking action on the North but the same will did not exist with regard to our traffic problems. We could tie ourselves in knots trying to explain the reasons for inaction over the years and we would have no shortage of excuses. Lack of finance is obviously the main one. It is now time to discuss, analyse fully and implement the many measures <Col N="624" /> required to improve the situation. Traffic calming is essential but I am mystified as to why dark curbing islands are placed in often unsuitable locations without proper steps to ensure effectiveness. Such steps are simple and include fluorescent painting or reflective embedded studs.</P>
    <P>Many other issues need to be addressed, including excessive speed. I compliment the Garda for imposing fines totalling £0.25 million. While it is acceptable to allow 70 mile per hour speed limits on motorways, it is unacceptable when it means that juggernauts lane hop, regardless of their tacographs There should be different limits for different types of vehicles.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing problem with drink driving and drug taking while driving is becoming increasingly prevalent. Other problems include irresponsible and reckless driving, uninsured drivers and the length of time it takes to engineer better conditions at black spots. There is a need for a full analysis and re-evaluation of the existing speed limit schedules, the prohibition of sales which give control of cheap cars to groups of young people, the menace of joy riders and the provision of proper training facilities for new drivers. These and other issues are contributory factors to the daily slaughter on the roads. They must be addressed individually and whatever steps are necessary to reduce the carnage must be put in place. There are breaches of the laws covering these issues every day and in some instances very little is done to seek redress.</P>
    <P>The overriding failure has been the tendency to treat the awful happenings on the roads in a generalised fashion rather than addressing each incident as a specific occurrence to be analysed and addressed in a positive and preventative manner. There is a shocking difference in the approach to deaths, maiming and serious injuries on the roads from the treatment of deaths occurring in industry, construction sites or farms. The only interest in road deaths appears to be the numbers involved and whether they have increased or decreased over previous years. While it is necessary to measure the number of fatalities and accidents to quantify the impact of preventative measures, it is a disgrace to refer simply to the numbers of fatalities and accidents as nothing more than statistics. Where accidents occur in industry, construction sites or farms an analysis is almost always undertaken and in many instances specific recommendations on safety or changes in work practice are recommended by the Health and Safety Authority or other industrial safety organisations.</P>
    <P>However, in the case of road accidents we have become case hardened. It seems that because there are so many accidents there is a feeling of helplessness in terms of taking action to control them. When horrific accidents occur there is a Garda investigation into the law related aspects and concern is expressed, yet everything appears to carry on as if nothing happened. Perhaps a considerable time later &ndash; six or 12 months &ndash; a coroner may comment on a general accident <Col N="625" /> black spot but recommendations for change are seldom made and even less often acted on. It means that the killing and maiming continues.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking a keen interest in this aspect. Our approach must change. It should be a statutory requirement to examine the cause or causes of every serious accident, regardless of whether fatalities are involved, to see how we can prevent a recurrence. At present there is no body to act in this way. I am sometimes advised the Office of Public Works, NRA or other bodies may have an interest but nobody is making an honest attempt to analyse and address the contributing factors. We must ask why this carnage is happening and insist on answers. There will be many reasons but if we are serious we must identify them, accept them as failings and address them in an honest and forthright manner. It took years, almost a generation, to deal with the drink driving culture. We had a béal bocht for everyone who was caught and, if we do not act, in ten years the same approach will be taken to those using drugs while driving.</P>
    <P>We must examine the reasons we are lazy, sloppy and careless in our approach to the repair and maintenance of the infrastructure. Earlier this year, on a journey from Cork to Dublin, I counted no less than 45 badly damaged road signs. Some of them were relatively small direction signs in towns and villages, others were the forward warning signs which, according to the NRA and the road engineers, are so important. Local authorities are aware of how costly they are. I see these signs month after month, yet nothing is being done about them. I raised the issue at a PSE meeting with the NRA but they are still in the same condition. For the last six months outside one town a sign has been broken in halves, with one half thrown in a ditch. Others are crumpled.</P>
    <P>This is a manifestation of the fact that the designers and location experts are incapable of locating these relatively new signs where they would not be physically damaged. What hope is there of saving pedestrians, cyclists and others if the engineering work cannot be properly executed? A simple formula can be set down for safe procedure but it is not being done. I invite anybody to drive any other route in the country and examine how many road signs are damaged. Massive improvements have been made to the design features and standard of forward warning signs but it is worrying that, given the finance available, problems surrounding their location cannot be addressed. If we are unable to undertake such a straightforward engineering task what hope have we of designing and maintaining a safe major road network? In many instances signs indicating road works are still on display months after the work has been completed. Similarly, the debris of construction material, such as gravel stones or piles of tarmacadam, is left behind.</P>
    <P>I highlight these points to illustrate our sloppy approach to this issue. It is indicative of the kind of approach we as a nation take to certain issues. <Col N="626" /> It should not be tolerated. It is damaging and adds in a big way to the problems we face. If each individual happening is analysed it would emerge that there are often contributory factors that can be addressed.</P>
    <P>Regardless of where one drives, be it in a rural or urban area, one is almost guaranteed to find the road sign obscured by a hedge or a tree. I invite Members driving home to their constituencies to note this. It is a lethal situation and it is beyond me that it is tolerated by any local or national authority.</P>
    <P>A number of provisions in the Bill will significantly improve national road safety. The provision on penalty points is crucial. Most people welcome it. There have been complaints about the delay in introducing it but there were problems. Deputy Kenny pointed out that individual road traffic offences may not merit disqualification. However, a collective group of offences would indicate a dangerous pattern of behaviour and such drivers should face the consequences of their action. The system is tough but not unduly onerous. We should conduct a vigorous public information campaign to make people aware of the introduction of this legislation. The system must, ultimately, be seen to be transparent and fair.</P>
    <P>The provision whereby a person will be afforded the opportunity to pay a fixed charge which will result in the endorsement of a lower number of penalty points than would apply on court conviction must not be allowed to operate in a manner which allows better-off people to avoid the consequences of their actions. It must, instead, be seen as a sensible provision which allows for registering a penalty against people engaged in unsafe motoring without clogging up an already burdened court service. We must keep an eye on the latter aspect of that provision.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a pilot scheme under way in the south east which provides the general public with a hotline to which they can report any dangerous motoring activity. Notwithstanding the obvious concerns one would have about making hoax or malicious claims, I would be obliged if the Minister would, at a future date, report to the House on the operation of this scheme. If it is deemed a success, it should be extended on a nation-wide basis in conjunction with the implementation of the penalty points system. It is a good initiative; I hope there will be a good response to it.</P>
    <P>During my contribution last week on the new extradition arrangements between EU member states, I commented on how increasing co-operation between member states of the EU would lead to benefits for all. It is somewhat obvious, but a bad or dangerous driver in one country will pose similar dangers to the public in another member state. It is, therefore, to be welcomed that this Bill gives effect to the EU sponsored European Convention on Driving Disqualification which permits the imposition by one country of driving disqualification for offences com<Col N="627" /> mitted in another member state. It is a quality-of-life type of initiative through which the benefits of membership of a community can best be demonstrated to its citizens.</P>
    <P>A constituent recently informed me that on a single journey from Cork to Dublin he was overtaken on at least five occasions by people driving Great Britain or Northern Ireland registered cars at reckless speeds.</P>

      <P>I doubt Northern drivers or their British counterparts are systematically worse drivers but I am concerned that the view exists among motorists that they are immune to the law while driving outside their own jurisdictions. I am very interested in hearing if our colleagues in the Northern Assembly have had any such observation regarding motorists from the Republic related to them. I am unsure if road safety is being addressed by the implementation bodies. Perhaps they could take a look at it in the context of the EU directive and the obvious common interest.</P>
      <P>One of the major difficulties we have faced over the years has been the ingenuity used by legal experts to get their clients off on various traffic offences, usually drink related. For that reason and because of our written Constitution, we face a far more complex task in putting together legislation to deal with the ongoing carnage on our roads than most other countries. The approach of the legal profession was mentioned in another context but I saw an advertisement this morning stating that not alone are cases being taken on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; basis but one need not even pay for the phone call. The advertisement shows a line-up of people so that one can see exactly who they are dealing with. That, for me, smacks of irresponsibility. While we try to cope with this task, more of our people are killed or maimed. We, as politicians, must try to work together to ensure the technicalities repeatedly called upon in such circumstances are eliminated. We, as legislators, should work together on this issue &ndash; I know there will always be somebody out there trying to double-think us. It must become more socially acceptable to do the right thing by society than to get off on a technicality. It took us a long time to get that message. We must now make it socially unacceptable to get away with a major offence on a technicality.</P>
      <P>I welcome breath-testing. I, too, appeal to the Minister to deal with the use of cannabis and drugs. We were not helped by our colleagues in the UK who last week reduced the seriousness of the cannabis use offence. Driving while under the influence of drugs must be our next target. I tabled a question to the Minister requesting any information he has regarding the frequency with which taking illegal drugs is a factor in road accidents. I am fearful such incidents are increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill must not be seen in isolation. The <Col N="628" /> improvement in the quality of the road network is a key part of the necessary strategy to reduce fatalities.</P>
    <P>The Minister notified me last week, in the context of the NRA plans, that 55 lives could be saved by the introduction of a proper road structure. I commend the Bill and compliment the Minister on its introduction.</P>

      <P>As I leave the Dáil after almost 20 years, I believe the two major problems facing Irish society, the adoration and glorification of alcohol, will not ever be meaningfully addressed in this House. I am fairly confident on this. If I was a gambling man I would have a punt on it but I am not, as Members know. It is a national illness, an illness to which Irish people are particularly prone. Those problems will not ever be properly addressed. Nonetheless, I welcome these initiatives which will help to minimise the carnage on our roads.</P>
      <P>Up to 400 people are killed on our roads each year. The media does not give these fragmented events the attention they deserve. Families are left to grieve alone. If 400 people were killed in an explosion in this country the media would not leave it alone for two years. Carnage on Irish roads is directly linked to the abuse of alcohol to which Irish people are particularly prone. More people per head of population are killed on Irish roads than in any other country in Europe, but we do not address this problem in a meaningful way. One of the reasons for that is the influence which the vintners association has on Irish society and on the political world, my party included. Most rural Deputies hold their clinics in public houses and often receive a useful subscription from the owner during election time. We have all been invited by the Vintners Association to a drinks reception in Buswells Hotel. I hope to see the day when an Irish Government will come to terms with the tragedy which alcohol wreaks on the Irish nation and on young people in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More people are killed in County Louth each year than in any other county. We recently had four deaths in one week, two of which were linked directly to drink. The whole country grieved at the news of the death of the two young people who were about to begin a new life in Australia. I am not saying drink was a factor in <Col N="629" /> that case, I do not have any evidence to suggest that. The involvement of two huge trucks testifies to the dangers of driving from Dundalk to Dublin. Deputy Johnny Brady will be aware that two people were killed in the Louth-Meath region bringing the total number of people killed in that region in one week to seven. That is unacceptable by any standards. I ask the Minister why are cars capable of speeds up to 150 miles per hour &ndash; murder vehicles &ndash; allowed to drive on Irish roads on which the speed limit is 60 miles per hour? That is a nonsense &ndash; nonsense that we in Ireland are particularly good at. Cars are being driven at 150 miles per hour by adolescent boys who believe nothing can happen to them, only to somebody else. To allow that is like telling a child he can play with a gun but not to fire it because inevitably he will fire it out of curiosity. That nonsense could be stopped fairly easily. If we value human life, we should put governors on car engines, or is the motor lobby too strong to allow that to be done? </P>
    <P>Why are people allowed to use mobile phones while driving cars? It is a daily occurrence to see somebody driving with one hand while deeply engrossed in conversation on a phone held in the other hand. What happens if such a conversation leads to an emotional dispute or a domestic row? Loss of concentration for even a split second can result in somebody paying with his or her life. One does not have to be an intellectual to realise that that practice is wrong. People need to concentrate totally on their driving. I do not represent myself as holier than thou &ndash; I have driven too fast on occasions &ndash; but I firmly believe the use of telephones while driving cars should be totally banned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dennehy referred to drivers from Northern Ireland, on whom I can offer a first hand opinion. Why are Northern drivers not prosecuted in the Irish courts for driving offences in this jurisdiction? I live within three miles of the Border, just off the Newry road at Ravensdale &ndash; a killer road. I have witnessed lunatic driving by a section of our own people but, more particularly, by Northern drivers who seem to believe that, once they cross the Border into the Republic, they are free to drive at any speed they like. There is a heavy volume of lorry traffic which travels at very high speeds and is frequently involved in tragic accidents. I ask the Minister to address that question. A very high proportion of Northern drivers have been involved in fatalities in the County Louth area over the last ten years and many of them have got off scot free.</P>
    <P>We should consider the Swedish system of open prisons. Whether the offender is a politician, a clergyman, a businessman or an unemployed person, there is a mandatory prison sentence for people convicted of drink driving. In this country, there have been 137,000 prosecutions for drink driving since 1997. That is an average of 1,000 per month, and they are just the ones who were detected as distinct from the thou<Col N="630" /> sands who get away undetected. Even one drink driving incident in a person's lifetime can have fatal consequences for that person or for someone else. Those alarming figures are an indictment of our inability to come to terms with the problem and to address the danger of alcoholic drink to Irish society in general and to motorists in particular.</P>
    <P>The Newry road, from Dundalk to the Border, is the worst killer road in this country, with particular reference to the turn-off at the waterworks for Ravensdale. It is a major death trap with a tragedy waiting to happen. I indict the National Roads Authority and the Louth County Council for their failure to effect traffic calming and alleviating measures at this dangerous place, of which I have first hand knowledge. Plans for a western by-pass were developed back in 1984 but, while the county council acknowledge the danger to which I have referred, it is not willing to spend money until the new road is built, with traffic measures at the Ravensdale junction to be incorporated. Why wait? Why should people's lives be expendable for the sake of saving a few pounds? I am loath to criticise Louth County Council, of which I was a member for many years, but I feel it is remiss in not addressing this problem. I hope my comments may encourage the county council to implement remedial measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill for which people have been calling for quite some time. The huge volume of traffic on our roads and the associated safety issues are a matter of concern to all of us. I have become much more conscious of those issues as a result of commuting to Dublin and travelling within my constituency of South Tipperary. The number of accidents which are occurring and the number of near misses which one frequently sees must heighten our concern in relation to road safety.</P>
      <P>I wish to touch on a few aspects of this huge problem. Although it may not be part of this Bill, training of drivers is an important issue. It is something we are not doing as well as we should and we need to pay more attention to it. There is no reason that a section of the transition year course in schools should not deal with training the students for driving. At that age they are not legally handling cars but they are familiar with them and watch motor racing on television. The dangers on the roads should be part of the school curriculum.</P>
      <P>Ongoing training for drivers has been neglected. There are good and bad drivers on the roads. Some are excellent and probably do not require training but there is a huge number of other drivers who need ongoing training. With changing road conditions and increased volumes of traffic, ongoing training of drivers requires attention. If motorists were better trained there would be fewer accidents and, as a result, the cost of insurance would decrease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traffic calming measures were mentioned pre<Col N="631" /> viously. That is an issue we have not properly addressed. When Members drive around their constituencies, they tend to check which villages require traffic calming measures. Clerihan, a village between Clonmel and Cashel, requires such measures but there is no money available. The local people have been lobbying for traffic calming measures for some time. The village has expanded greatly in recent years and last week I visited it with the roads engineer. He informed me that it needed to be done but there was not enough money because other villages throughout the county had to be dealt with beforehand. Given the increasing volume of traffic throughout the country, we need to examine what is required for such villages and put traffic calming measures in place.</P>
    <P>We can do more. I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister about locating warning flashing lights outside schools but I received a most unsatisfactory answer. No school should be without such lights when young children are entering and leaving, particularly when there is so much traffic on the roads. The lights would warn motorists of the dangers ahead. A young child is liable to do anything, including run under a car. They forget the rules quite easily so drivers must be particularly careful when approaching schools.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have referred to people who drive when under the influence of drugs. This is a huge problem and we have not yet tackled it. I agree wholeheartedly with the previous speaker that we confronted the drink driving issue. It was a major problem some years ago but it has been confronted. As a matter of urgency, however, we must address the problem of motorists driving under the influence of drugs. In the course of a general conversation with a garda recently, he told me he had stopped a few young drivers whom he knew to be under the influence of drugs. They had not been drinking. He tested them for drink but he knew they had taken some other substance. This is a serious matter. That is probably the reason one will see young drivers racing cars late at night on certain stretches of the road. We have not addressed this issue yet and we must do so. I would like to discuss other issues but I do not have sufficient time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister and his officials on the introduction of this Bill and on the preparation of a comprehensive set of measures designed to update the law and contribute to the improved safety of the travelling public. There are a number of aspects of the Bill on which I wish to comment and I will also mention a number of topical issues which are related to road traffic and road safety. The main items I wish to comment on are the road safety measures in the <Col N="632" /> Bill, proper enforcement of these measures, Garda organisation, resources and accountability, road development under the national development plan, road safety in the haulage industry and motor insurance for young drivers.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a further building block in the Government's national road safety strategy. Even its harshest critics must acknowledge that the Government was the first to formulate, introduce and successfully implement such a strategy. The strategy specified demanding and quantified targets in relation to road safety and the Government and various road safety agencies made themselves accountable for performance under the plan. The interim targets set under the strategy were met by the end of 2000. These were to reduce the rate of road fatalities per million inhabitants to a figure not exceeding 116 and to complete specific accident reduction measures at 240 locations on the national road network. By the end of 1999, the road fatality rate had been reduced to 112 per million and 300 accident reduction schemes had been put in place. Credit must be given where it is due and there have been further improvements since then.</P>
      <P>The centrepiece of the Bill is the introduction of the long-awaited penalty points system for driving offences. This is specifically designed to improve road safety by clearly setting out the punitive consequences of reckless, careless and dangerous driving. By introducing a national computer-based system with national driver files, it will also give a measure of transparency and consistency to the application and enforcement of the laws in relation to road safety and road traffic offences nationwide. This is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>I am also glad that in addition to the penalty points system, which has proved its worth in other jurisdictions, the monetary penalties for road traffic offences are being updated and increased. It is common knowledge that appeals for common sense in matters of compliance with the law generally and with road safety in particular are relatively ineffective by themselves in bringing about positive changes in human behaviour. It has been further well demonstrated that what really works is a balanced approach using the carrot and the stick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The classic example of this was the ineffectiveness of various measures to combat illegal parking in Dublin, which impeded traffic flows as well as creating safety hazards over the years. The behaviour of vehicle owners did not seriously change until the introduction of clamping. This worked wonders in a short space of time. To be effective, the penalty points system must encompass a comprehensive education programme for drivers which clearly highlights not only the short-term consequences of losing one's licence for a period of time but the longer-term effects in terms of employment and insurance coverage. This has been done successfully in the USA. I urge the Minister and his officials not to <Col N="633" /> neglect the requirement for a hard-hitting public information campaign.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the use of camera evidence. I reject the attempts by the Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Mitchell, to dilute the Bill's provisions in this regard. There is, on the basis of the carrot and stick approach I mentioned earlier, good reason to make owners responsible for the behaviour of those to whom they lend their vehicles.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, said earlier this year when he was launching this Bill that increased road safety was all about increasing driver responsibility. Cars in the wrong hands can be lethal weapons. Increased flexibility in relation to breath testing for drink driving is also to be welcomed as it is now clear beyond contradiction that a high proportion of accidents, including fatal accidents, are alcohol related. I agree with Deputy McGahon about speeding and the use of mobile phones by people driving lorries, buses, jeeps and cars. Nobody can manage a truck and at the same time be conducting business on a mobile phone.</P>
    <P>However, enacting newer and tougher measures is of little consequence unless these measures are enforced. Some speakers have already mentioned that the existing system of on-the-spot fines has been brought into ridicule by high levels of non-enforcement with some uncivic minded people boasting about it as if it were a badge of honour. I urge the Minister to consult with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner to ensure that these new measures are fully and properly enforced. There is little point in one arm of the State conducting expensive public education programmes if another has a laid back attitude to enforcement.</P>
    <P>Proper enforcement leads inevitably to the issue of Garda resources for traffic management and road safety. Some of my colleagues have felt for some time that there is a strong argument for the establishment of a dedicated Garda traffic corps. I have considerable sympathy with that view.</P>
    <P>Traffic congestion and road safety are serious issues not only in Dublin but in every town and village in Ireland. Rapidly rising prosperity has led to an explosion in car numbers and haulage vehicles in recent years. It sometimes seems that management of these issues by the Garda takes a back seat to its focus on crime and security issues. A dedicated traffic corps with adequate resources and a management of its own would bring a clear focus to these issues. Tens of millions of pounds are being lost annually through traffic congestion and road accidents. Accountability for these issues is too diffuse under the present arrangement for them to be in any way effective. The example of other administrations with dedicated traffic police could be fruitfully studied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> The current national development plan has a multi-billion pound road development programme. This is a vital component of the infrastructural development necessary to underpin our continued economic growth and to address regional and spatial imbalances by providing better links between the hinterlands of the Border, midland and western region in particular, and the major cities. These roads and motorways are being built to the highest international safety standards and we need matching road traffic laws that fully reflect modern circumstances and traffic systems.</P>
    <P>It is of great importance that this road development programme be allowed to proceed unhindered and I am particularly pleased, coming from a farming constituency, that according to last night's announcement a satisfactory draft settlement has been reached between the Government, the IFA and the National Roads Authority on the contentious issue of compensation for farmland compulsorily acquired for road construction. I compliment my ministerial colleague, Deputy Dempsey, and the President of the IFA, Tom Parlon. I hope that any outstanding issues with the ICMSA can also be speedily settled. The road building programme can now proceed apace and farmers can be assured of getting equitable compensation for land they must surrender in the overall national interest.</P>
    <P>While speaking on road safety and Garda resources I would also like to say a few words on the haulage industry. This industry has expanded enormously with the rapid growth in the economy and it is a sector which many observers as well as established legitimate operators feel is not well regulated. Many law abiding hauliers complain that they are being undercut by rogue operators who have scant regard for Transport Acts and regulations or issues of employee and general road safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is timely that we are discussing this legislation as we approach the Christmas season. The historical evidence is that there will be increased numbers of accidents on the roads at this time. This Bill must be examined against the backdrop of the increased number of deaths on our roads. Last year there were 415 deaths and this year to date there have been in the region of 365.</P>
      <P>The number of cars on our roads has increased dramatically. Given the economic development in the country the number of heavy goods vehicles has increased. There has been a huge change in people's behaviour in terms of their driving ability and their behaviour towards other road users. The road rage phenomenon is now recognised worldwide. We have had experiences in this country that tell us that it is new to our roads and a phenomenon which should be considered when dealing with these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will go some way towards dealing with the problems on Irish roads. There is also a need for an increase in Garda activity in this area. I <Col N="635" /> compliment the gardaí on their excellent work over the years in their efforts to minimise traffic accidents, speed and other offences on Irish roads. Whatever is required in terms of Garda manpower, technology, speed traps, vehicles and any other necessary equipment, should be made available. The input of the Garda is vital. The public representatives are in favour of this process but we need to put meat on the bones &ndash; we need to invest in the system and we need to support the gardaí and grant their operational requests.</P>
    <P>An educational process must be undertaken in the schools to teach the children, the future drivers, how to behave on our roads. There is every possibility that quite a number of them will be killed or injured on our roads in the future. County enterprise boards could also play a part. We could single out the driving schools which have constructed driving tracks. Many people use industrial estates for driving practice because they can learn how to manoeuvre vehicles in safety there. There are specially constructed tracks available for this purpose in England and on the continent. People can safely engage in the learning process before they use the roads system. That is a project that could be supported financially by county enterprise boards or indeed any other agency or organisation in each county.</P>
    <P>Traffic calming measures have been mentioned by many speakers. In each constituency there are plenty of examples of villages and towns along the road that require lighting and proper traffic management. The need for speed control and pedestrian priority in these locations must be acknowledged and funded. I also want to draw the Minister's attention to the working of the NRA regarding road design. On many occasions in this House I have asked the Minister to single out one particular road bypass, the PiltownFiddown bypass in my constituency, to see if there is anything we can learn from the road construction programme undertaken there by the NRA in conjunction with the local council. I believe that the drink-driving advertisement that appears on television could have been based on one particular house in the constituency.</P>
    <P>This brings up the question of safety issues. In 11 kilometres of road there are 13 right-hand junctions. Some of the accidents that happened recently in other counties were due to poorly marked out right-hand junctions. Such is the fear of the local community with regard to road safety that they have prevailed upon the local county council to introduce ghost islands with lights on each of those junctions. That was unanimously endorsed by the members of Kilkenny County Council. The council was then told that this must be approved, first, by the NRA and funded by it if necessary. This is a safety issue and a matter of grave concern for road users and the people who live in that area.</P>
    <P>I formally repeat my request to the Minister to reconsider and appoint a Department official to <Col N="636" /> examine the Norris case and the PiltownFiddown bypass from the point of view of road safety and the safety of the Norris family. Road design is critical in this area.</P>
    <P>Whenever discussion takes place on road accidents the question of young drivers always comes up. I am a member of the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and we spoke to the insurance industry representatives about this matter. It is an outrage that insurance companies are allowed to increase insurance premia again this year. This puts insurance beyond the reach of young drivers. Not every young driver is irresponsible and, indeed, it is not the sole preserve of the young. There are many drivers of all ages who travel on the roads without insurance. My greatest fear is that because of the prohibitive rates of insurance, it is out of the reach of those who require a car for the purposes of work or other reasons. This issue is in urgent need of review.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Enterprise and Small Business has been trying to deal with this matter but has not had success. This year the insurance industry appears to be looking for increases of up to 60%. While the events of 11 September are to be regretted, they are being blamed for every increase that takes place. I fear this may be simply an excuse by some insurance companies to hike up the cost of insurance beyond reason and those who will suffer most from this are young drivers.</P>
    <P>In this economy the people who travel most, for work and other reasons, are young married couples. Many young people travel from my constituency in Kilkenny to Dublin on a daily basis for work. We need to do something urgently about the insurance industry. Will the Minister, in the context of this Bill, revisit this area? Perhaps it will not be addressed under this Bill, but it needs to be considered. I urge the Minister to engage with the insurance industry to see if we can find some solution to the issue of over-priced insurance.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the haulage industry and speed. I come from a haulage industry background and know that every truck is now fitted with a speed control unit. I believe there is a further need to engage with this industry, and indeed with car manufacturers, to ensure that the safety measures that we discuss in this House and that should be implemented, are complied with by car and truck manufacturers. It is absolutely necessary that speed controls on these vehicles are implemented as it is easy to bypass them, but this can be stopped at source by the manufacturers.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged by this Bill and hope it will be implemented as quickly as possible and that all the resources necessary to ensure its success will be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. The statistics for fatalities and injuries caused by road accidents are horrific when one considers that on average at least one person per day will die on our roads. That is a staggering statistic for a small country. The amount of traffic on our roads has increased enormously over recent years. As has been said previously by some of my colleagues, a car is an essential part of everyday life, especially in rural areas. Young people need cars to get to work as there is no alternative means of transport. We can bring in all the legislation we like in this House but if the law is not imposed it will not be effective. I believe we need a national traffic corps in the Garda just as there are special corps in other areas.</P>
      <P>I am sure even Members of this House are guilty of some irresponsibility while driving. One misdemeanour of which I am very conscious is that when a car stops outside a house to let somebody out, they do not turn off their headlights. A stationary car with its headlights on is absolutely lethal. There may be some chance for an oncoming car when meeting a car with full headlights but a stationary car's lights are totally blinding. In my experience flashing one's lights or hooting the horn at such a driver elicits no response, which leads me to the belief that this is considered normal practice. Incredibly those people do not have their warning lights on at the back of the car, instead they leave their headlights on. If an accident occurs they plead that they had their lights on and could not be responsible. I hope the Minister will make recommendations at the Cabinet table to his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that a separate unit of the Garda be set up to deal with traffic.</P>
      <P>Some of my colleagues referred to daytime lights. Accidents during daylight are mostly related to cars overtaking that meet other cars head-on. At this time of the year, especially toward dusk, people take chances when overtaking. Ten years ago it was possible to take this risk but today's levels of traffic do not permit it. The odds are that there will be oncoming traffic. I do not want to focus on young drivers, but because cars are very powerful nowadays, people are tempted to overtake. People frequently drive at 50 and 60 miles per hour, even on minor roads. Then, one spots a car in one's rear view mirror which is suddenly on top of one's rear bumper with the driver beeping the horn as he attempts to pass. Many accidents are caused when account is not taken of oncoming traffic. The lighting of roads, which was introduced as a pilot scheme in the past, could help in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of mobile telephones in cars has been mentioned but anything that causes one to take one's eye off the road is dangerous. One is bound to lose concentration if one is in a telephone conversation while driving, no matter to whom one is talking, although it might depend on that nature of the conversation. If one is in conversation <Col N="638" /> with one's bank manager, one will lose concentration very quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>A traffic corps could be set up to monitor such activity on a full-time basis. Much of this carelessness could be eliminated as motorists would have to be more wary on the roads.</P>
      <P>The NRA is a great mystery. It is like something up in the sky which one cannot reach. County councils throughout the State send deputations to the NRA. Officials of the authority meet the local authority officials, look them up and down, are very nice to them and that is the end of the process. The Minister and his Department will say roads are the responsibility of the NRA. The authority is the answer to everything but it has solved nothing.</P>
      <P>The transfer of traffic management powers from local authorities to the NRA demonstrates how out of touch is the Department. The NRA, by all means, should oversee road building but it does not want to know about traffic calming and other measures. Local authorities cannot implement such measures on national primary routes because it is the responsibility of the authority. I appeal to the Minister to restore some powers to local authorities. County councillors and county engineers understand local problems. I hope the Minister will examine this issue.</P>
      <P>Local authorities will be provided with more responsibility for taxi licensing and so on, which is welcome. The Longford by-pass on the N5 is essential. I hope the Minister will use his influence to progress that project because it is badly needed. People from the west are held up day in, day out, as they attempt to drive through Longford town. Heavy traffic passes through the town and it is not good enough that such traffic should have to try to negotiate its way through a county town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of cars and other vehicles on our roads has more than doubled in recent years. No matter what the time, there is always traffic on the roads. Naturally this has led to drivers taking more chances and has increased the likelihood of accidents. I welcome the provisions in the legislation to deter motorists from taking chances. There is traffic chaos in our towns and cities because of the increased number of vehicles on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the enactment of the legislation will also have far-reaching consequences for drivers. It will not affect those who obey the rules of the road and drive correctly, but continual offenders may be deterred from doing so again. The penalty points system is quite severe but an intensive publicity campaign will be needed to alert drivers because many do not realise what are the penalties. I do not mean a full page advertisement in the weekend newspapers with a colour photograph of the Minister telling people what they <Col N="639" /> should do as has been the practice in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The Minister was looking out at me from every newspaper last Sunday and Monday.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the correct way to inform the public. It is only a publicity stunt on behalf of the Minister. Every licence holder should be informed by post what are the penalties for breaching the rules of the road when the Bill is enacted because that is the best form of the publicity.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister support the recent decision of the Minister for Public Enterprise to permit 50% of freight carried on the rail network to be transferred to our roads? Are there not enough heavy goods vehicles on the roads already without adding 50% of rail freight? HGVs are responsible for accidents such as the high profile accident in Louth recently. Two lorries were involved with one hitting a car that was turning right from behind and shunting it into the path of another. Tragically, two young people in their 20s who had planned to emigrate to Australia were killed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny referred to the hazard caused by traffic turning right on national primary and secondary roads. As a line of traffic approaches a right hand junction at which a car is turning right, the first driver in the line can see the car is turning but the driver in the fourth or fifth car will often attempt to pass out cars immediately in front of him or her and crash into the car turning right. The design of such junctions should be improved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny also mentioned the pilot scheme under which traffic islands were built outside towns on national, primary and secondary routes. What were the results of the scheme? I do not know how many times the islands were damaged by cars but there is nothing to stop a car from crashing into an island. There must be a better way. The traffic islands were only installed on a trial basis. I would like the Minister to inform the House about the findings of that scheme. They have reduced speed but has the number of accidents been reduced? The design of traffic islands could be improved or they could be removed altogether and other measures taken, including the use of security cameras and more severe penalties for motorists who break speed limits in built up areas. Traffic islands have failed; indeed they have been a contributory factor in many accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of speakers dealt with young drivers. I realise the difficulties with young drivers because I had four in my house &ndash; they were in my house, they are in different houses now &ndash; and there are many young people in the public gallery. Insurance for young drivers is increasing because an examination of the statistics indicate <Col N="640" /> that the majority of people killed on the roads are young drivers, particularly young male drivers between the ages of 17 and 25 years. It is on these facts that insurance companies base their premiums. The majority of these people are not killed on their way to work. The majority of accidents occur between Thursday night and early on Monday morning.</P>
    <P>Parents have a great responsibility in this regard. If a parent gives his or her powerful car to a 20 year old son for the weekend, a grave responsibility rests on that parent to ensure that young person drives in a correct and safe manner. A bigger responsibility rests with the parent to ensure he or she does not give the young person a car which can reach a speed of 110 or 115 miles per hour, despite the fact that the speed limit is 60 or 65 miles per hour. If there are three or four young family members who reach driving age, it would be advisable to only allow them to drive these powerful cars when accompanied by one of the parents. I would lay down such a rule up to a certain age. If they must have their own car to go to work, to a match or any other social event or weekend activity, it should be a low powered car. There is nothing wrong with driving a Ford Fiesta which cannot travel comfortably at more than 50 miles per hour.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we will hear of accidents next weekend, the following weekend and so on because the statistics indicate that eight people on average are killed on the roads every week. Unfortunately, eight people will be killed again next week and if only seven are killed, nine people will be killed the following week. When one hears about a tragedy where a young family's car hit a tree, the car went off the road or it was involved in a head-on collision with a heavier vehicle, speed and lack of experience in controlling a high powered car is the cause of such accidents. That did not affect our generation because we did not get the opportunity to drive high powered cars. Parents have a considerable role to play in this regard and they must endeavour to save lives by talking to their young families about the dangers involved. Young people do not realise &ndash; I have seen how my children drive &ndash; how easily speed can pick up in a high powered car.</P>
    <P>In the time I have left I would like to ask the Minister a few questions on the Bill. The explanatory memorandum states that the Bill transfers responsibility for control of taxi stands and bus stops from the Garda Commissioner to local authorities. Will local authorities be compensated or provided with the necessary staff to carry out this function? Many functions have recently been hived off to the local authorities. These include the control of pollution and planning functions, but adequate staffing is not being made available to local authorities to deal with this extra work. As this will be extra work for local authorities, will the Minister provide them with extra staff to fulfil the functions assigned by the Bill?</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the endorsement of the <Col N="641" /> penalty points system. The explanatory memorandum states that in the case of most penalty point offences, a person will be afforded the opportunity to pay a fixed charge, as set out in section 11, which will result in the endorsement of a lower number of penalty points than would apply on court conviction. I would like clarification on that point because it seems like a buy-out whereby if a person is fined he or she will have a lesser number of penalty fines for the same offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Traffic Act, 1961, is probably one of the most significant Acts on the Statute Book. It introduced a series of initiatives such as disqualification orders, the offences of dangerous and careless driving and the requirement for a driving test. It seems incredible today that at one time there was no offence of dangerous and careless driving and that there was no requirement for a driving test.</P>
      <P>Since 1961 there has been a comprehensive code relating to drink driving, speed limit controls and the change in the role of local authorities in regard to traffic control. This Bill goes much further. It is aimed at improving road safety in tandem with the Government's five year national strategy, with a target of a 20% reduction in deaths and injuries within the lifetime of the strategy. The Government is the first ever to have adopted a national road safety strategy. As part of that strategy the Government has made itself more accountable than before for progress on road safety activities.</P>
      <P>Although it is not immediately evident from the horrific accidents which are reported every week in the media, there has been a significant improvement in road safety measures. As the Minister outlined, between 1997 and 2000 the level of road deaths fell by 12.1% and the number of serious injuries decreased by almost 25%. The indications are that these trends have been maintained in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obvious and visible progress has been made in the area of law enforcement. In 2000, 224,000 on-the-spot fine notices were issued for speeding. Some 59,000 notices were issued for the non-wearing of seat belts and 10,400 detections for drink driving. The Bill aims to support further the Government's road safety strategy in an effort to reduce the unacceptably high numbers of road deaths and injuries through the introduction of new deterrents and financial penalties for traffic offences. When the Bill becomes law it will result in the introduction of the much debated penalty points system. It will also result in fines being increased significantly for road traffic offences. It <Col N="642" /> will introduce a revised system of fixed charges to replace the current on-the-spot fines system. It will extend the use of cameras and permit preliminary breath testing of drivers when involved in a road accident or a breach of road traffic law. It will allow an EU state to disqualify a driver for offences committed in another EU state and it will allow the Minister to buy in services under the Road Traffic Acts. It will also transfer responsibility for taxi stands and bus stops from the Garda to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Probably one of the most radical elements of the Bill is the introduction of the long-awaited penalty points system, similar to that in operation in four other EU countries and which it is acknowledged has been successful in reducing road casualties. The Minister indicated in his speech that there are legal and constitutional difficulties which have to be considered before the introduction of the penalty points system. However, on passing the Bill it will become law, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>There are currently a number of very serious offences in respect of which a conviction will lead automatically to the loss of a driving licence. In many cases disqualification only applies on conviction for a second or subsequent offence. The new penalty points system will extend to those offences that have a direct impact on road safety, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>The penalty points system allows drivers in the majority of cases, when they have received notice of an offence, to pay the fixed charge and incur a low level of points or to decide to go to court.Unlike penalty point systems which apply in other jurisdictions, there is certainty for the driver of the level of penalty points which will apply, where a fixed charge is paid or where a conviction is given. If the court convicts a person the level of penalty points is increased significantly. The option of paying a fixed charge is not being made available for certain offences and that is right and proper. These include careless driving, using a vehicle without insurance and driving a dangerously defective vehicle.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has considered accepting payment of fines by way of instalments. It is unacceptable that people should be jailed for not paying fines if they are not in a position to pay the entire amount in one instalment. Where payment for a fine is not received within 28 days there will be a 50% increase on the fine payable. I ask the Minister to accept the payment of fines by instalment. We want to see the removal of motoring offences from the courts but we certainly do not want to see an increase in the number of people jailed for not paying fines. Will the Minister, with his colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; who I assume is responsible for this area &ndash; consider accepting fines by way of instalment?</P>
    <P>Where a motorist receives 12 penalty points over a three year period an automatic six months disqualification from driving will follow. This is the first time anyone will be disqualified from <Col N="643" /> driving without the involvement of the courts and I welcome that. It will release more time in court schedules for matters other than those covered by the Road Traffic Acts. There will not be a change in the current circumstances where disqualification follows conviction for a single serious offence. I welcome the necessary IT support infrastructure which is vital to the success of this system. There is no point in putting a system in place unless it can be implemented.</P>
    <P>Unless there are real and tangible penalties some drivers will refuse to alter the way they drive. The possible loss of their driving licences, in addition to heavy fines, will, I hope, force those drivers to drive with more care, attention and consideration for other drivers and pedestrians. Fear is a much stronger motivation than a sense of responsibility. Section 9 allows for co-operation with other EU member states in applying driving disqualification for a number of serious road traffic offences committed in another member state. This is based on the European Convention on Driving Disqualification which I understand was signed by Ireland in 1998. This will ensure that a person who commits a serious traffic offence in one EU country cannot continue to drive in another member state. Deputy McGahon's contribution referred to some instances of that. Most traffic enforcement will no longer have to be dealt with by the courts. There will be a radical review of fines for traffic offences, the introduction of fixed charges and extension of the use of cameras in detecting offences. This is also to be welcomed for a number of reasons. Motorists will know the consequences of their actions and it will free up court time.</P>
    <P>When the laws on drink-driving were changed in 1994 a commitment was given that there would be a review of the requirement for a garda to form the opinion that a person had been drinking before a breathalyser could be used. This Bill makes good that commitment and extends the power of the Garda regarding the use of breathalysers. Section 10 allows a garda to request a breath specimen where a driver is involved in a road accident or where an offence is considered to have been committed. This has not been the position before and when presenting a case in court a garda had to support the use of a breathalyser by saying he believed a driver to have in his system, more than the permitted alcohol limit. This is in addition to the powers of the Garda to conduct a breath test where there is a suspicion that a driver has been drinking. These powers have been extended because research shows that alcohol is a factor in up to 33% of fatal accidents in Ireland. The Bill does not currently allow for random breath testing but the Minister has indicated that he looks forward to Committee Stage and that may indicate he is amenable to revisiting this area.</P>
    <P>Section 30 is innovative and is to be welcomed. Heavy lorries travel through residential areas in parts of my constituency at all hours of day and <Col N="644" /> night. Industries, in some cases most inappropriate industries such as cement manufacturers, preceded housing in those areas. I would appreciate if the Minister would indicate if it is necessary for the local authority to request that the Minister make regulations under this section in specific areas. Maybe he could identify how this will work in specific areas.</P>
    <P>The extension of the role of local authorities in implementing traffic controls, provided for under the Road Traffic Act, 1994, is very evident and has been reasonably successful in the Dublin area. That is despite much criticism from both the public and local authority members. The dreaded clampers in the Dublin local authority area have succeeded in bringing about a major change in parking violations and the abuse of bus lanes by motorists. Once motorists realise there is a penalty and the law will be enforced their behaviour changes dramatically. There was a time, since I became a Member of the Oireachtas, where there was no chance of getting a parking space in the environs of St. Stephen's Green. Metered parking spaces, bus lanes and the prohibition of a left turn at the end of Dawson Street are all obeyed by motorists because they know they will be clamped, or a garda will be waiting at the end of the bus lane and a fine will result.</P>
    <P>There is no point in having laws in place unless they are enforced. The statistics which the Minister gave in his Second Stage speech show that enforcement and implementation is high in a number of areas. Fines are being applied and clamping is being used to free parking spaces. That ensures that people can come to the city and use the parking facilities. They are no longer used by people who park for the day, feed the meter for one hour and then disappear for another seven. The extension of the role of the local authorities in implementing traffic laws has worked in Dublin and I presume has worked outside the city also.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives power to local authorities to determine the location of stands for taxis. There was a great deal of debate when the taxi industry was deregulated as to whether there would be enough taxi stands and who would provide additional ones. It also extends the powers of local authorities to decide where bus stops can be located. That seems an obvious proposal. Perhaps the gardaí and the local authorities decide where bus stops are positioned. In my experience there are many bus stops beside continuous white lines. I have brought that to the attention of the local authority but nothing was done; perhaps those authorities are above the law. I do not know why bus stops are placed parallel to continuous white lines because they are serious traffic hazards and increase the possibility of accidents. The involvement of local authority members should mean safer positioning of bus stops.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister of State confirm that enforcement of weight limits will still be carried out by the gardaí? It is the only criticism I have of Garda enforcement because in my constituency there <Col N="645" /> are significant three tonne weight limits in Ballyfermot, Inchicore, Crumlin and Drimnagh but they are not being enforced by the gardaí. I know they have a lot to do but there is no point in having such restrictions if they are not enforced. Admittedly, they are difficult to enforce because if a lorry is stopped on the Inchicore Road, for example, the driver will say he is heading to the industrial estate and must use the Inchicore Road. Maybe the gardaí have given up on this. Will the Minister confirm the gardaí are still responsible for enforcing those limits? I presume they are the only ones who can do it. They should be encouraged to enforce the limits as they are not being enforced in a meaningful way at present.</P>
    <P>There have been repeated calls by reputable driving schools to the Minister to approve driving schools but nothing was done before the publication of this Bill. I welcome section 18 which deals specifically with the matter as it gives the Minister power to approve bodies for the purpose of quality control among driving instructors. That is only right as people go to driving instructors and hand over the money in the belief that those instructors are reputable and qualified. However, that is not the case at present as presumably anyone with a driving licence can set up a driving school and give instruction. That is totally unsatisfactory and I welcome section 18 which introduces controls for driving schools.</P>
    <P>The use of cameras for the enforcement of traffic laws is also very welcome. At present cameras can only be used to establish the speed of a vehicle and they are very effective in that context. However, I understand the Bill allows cameras to be used to enforce traffic laws generally.</P>
    <P>I support previous speakers who referred to drivers using mobile phones. This is not covered in the Bill but it is a safety matter which cries out for urgent attention. The Minister must ensure that anyone using a mobile phone in a car is using a hands free set. Last week I saw a lady driving around a roundabout with a cigarette in one hand and a mobile phone in the other. She must have been steering with her knees because there was no other way she could have been driving the car. The use of side or dipped lights in winter should also be looked at. Previous speakers referred to the traffic islands outside small towns which have been built as a traffic calming measure and are very successful . Such speed controls have had an effect on my driving.</P>
    <P>When my father taught me to drive I was 17 and he told me to go on the road believing everyone else was an idiot, to assume they would make mistakes or cause accidents and to anticipate that. That was probably good advice that applies equally today. This Bill is not a panacea but is part of the Government strategy. The other matter the Minister should address is a gender issue. Young boys drive differently from girls and I speak as a mother of two girls and a boy. Boys' cars have souped-up engines and the boy racer syndrome means they do not like to be seen as <Col N="646" /> learner drivers, so they do not use learner plates. Advertising campaigns must be addressed at young men who do not like to be seen as unable to drive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Ring.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this Bill because we do not have sufficient opportunities to speak on road safety, traffic management and the other issues which affect safe travel on our roads. I agree with many of the previous speakers about distractions but I am not so sure about the mobile phone as it is an easy victim. Long ago when one was learning to fly a plane, one was supposed to be able to land or take off while using the intercom at the same time. If one could not do so one did not pass one's test. One should be trained to use something and respect it, whether it is a mobile phone, the car heater or radio otherwise we will have people pulling in to change gears. These are all distractions which remove one's focus. However, mobile phones should be placed high on the dashboard so the driver does not have to look down and take their eyes off the road to take a call.</P>
      <P>When people suggest every car should pull in, they should remember it is illegal to pull in on a motorway. That cannot be done, so there are contradictions we should recognise. I welcome the Bill generally but I am concerned by the mandatory penalties. Given the decisions of the courts in relation to other matters recently, I have considerable doubts as to how some of these regulations would fare in the courts later.</P>
      <P>What are the real causes of accidents on the roads? The first is the way we learn to drive. Years ago I proposed off-the-road, simulated instruction for all drivers. It would have been hugely beneficial but it has never been taken up. There was never any move to further the proposal. Insurance is another issue. A driver who is named on a parent's insurance can drive for ten years but most insurance companies give him or her no benefit when he or she opt to insure themselves. That is ridiculous as it is obvious that if the driver were clocking up credits while driving on a parent's insurance it would focus him or her on driving since it would be to his or her benefit to keep a clean record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest single contributing factor to road accidents is bad roads. It is not a reflection on the Minister of State as I have said to his face many times in the past. There are countless places in the country where up to 25 fatal accidents have taken place. In one area in my constituency the tally is about 23 in the last 18 or 19 years. Why is that? Is this because people are using mobile telephones, switching on the radio, turning up the car heater, changing gear or allowing themselves to be distracted by something passing by? It is a coincidence that each of these factors should lead to accidents at the same location. There has to be another contributory factor, and I believe it is the <Col N="647" /> safety of the road itself. Signs indicating accident black spots have been erected in hundreds of locations where many people have tragically died. Why do we not learn? Why have we not done something about it? Instead of posting a warning, accusing the Garda of not doing enough or saying people are driving too fast, we should consider improving the safety of the roads. It is the simplest way to address the problem.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the matter a little more carefully. Serious accidents take place at junctions serving minor roads. Such junctions are often inadequately illuminated, poorly surfaced and served by substandard signage. One can check the scene of any accident to confirm that these matters are major contributory factors. Another cause of accidents is the parking of vehicles on the margins of motorways. When we speak of solving this appalling problem, we need to look at all issues rather than dealing with one or two of them.</P>
    <P>Poor driving is another factor that contributes to the high incidence of road accidents. Those who have developed bad motoring habits and who drive dangerously may escape for a while, but not indefinitely. All Deputies have observed motorists who pull out in front of traffic, only looking in one direction. This has led to countless accidents, but those responsible complain that the oncoming motorist did not see them. Motorists are not always to blame, however, as they are often plagued by zig-zag cyclists, including couriers dressed in camouflage. Such cyclists often move with great alacrity from one side of the road to the other, without regard for the rules of the road or their personal safety. More accidents are waiting to happen due to the fact that heavy goods vehicles drive up the centre of the main thoroughfare of every village, town and city in Ireland. Local authorities have narrowed many junctions and put in place unsuitable regulations, but they blame someone else when accidents happen. The concentration of heavy goods vehicles in urban areas will continue to create serious problems.</P>
    <P>At dusk in our cities, it can be difficult to determine where cycle lanes begin and end and to distinguish between the lanes for buses, cars and bicycles. One needs a map, or perhaps to get out of one's car to look at the road markings, to understand what is going on. This is another contributory factor. There will always be accidents, but we should do our best to eliminate as many of them as possible. One naturally assumes our actions will contribute to a reduction in the number of accidents.</P>
    <P>I have covered almost all the matters that annoy me from time to time, including mobile phones, radios, lighting cigarettes and smoking, but I wish to outline two other bugbears of mine. The first of these is people who gaze at passers by. How often does one see people driving in one direction, but looking in another? It is a recipe for disaster, along the lines of a lady I observed steering her car with her knees. Another matter <Col N="648" /> that frustrates me has been mentioned by Deputies during this debate. Increased traffic has caused great difficulty in determining where one should turn right, especially at staggered junctions. Oncoming traffic tends to blind motorists at night and junctions and road markings can become blurred. As the volume of traffic increases, this problem will cause a greater number of accidents. The National Roads Authority has addressed the problem to an extent, but not as much as it should have.</P>
    <P>The final matter I wish to discuss has been raised by Deputy Belton, who complained about the pilgrimage public representatives have to make to the offices of the NRA, which was set up by an order of this House as an appendage to a Department. It is an unfortunate sign of the times that elected public representatives have to make representations to an unelected public body that is accountable to nobody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to start by asking a question, which should be answered when the debate is being concluded. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, outline the rules and regulations as regards lighting, especially spotlights on lorries? One thinks one is about to encounter a circus when one sees lorries that are extravagantly illuminated, but it is a dangerous and serious matter. The Minister of State should contact the Garda Commissioner so the House can be informed of the relevant regulations. Given that one will now be banned from driving if one does not dim one's headlights, why are people allowed to drive with high powered spotlights? Something needs to be done, as the law is not being implemented. It is a disgrace that different lighting is used for cars and lorries. Instead of taking the soft option of collecting £50 from those caught speeding by a camera, the Garda Síochána should deal with this more serious law breaking. When one leaves Dublin on a Friday evening, it might take five minutes to travel three miles or it might take an hour to travel ten miles. If one travels at 35 miles per hour in an area where the speed limit is 30 miles per hour, one runs the risk of getting a ticket.</P>
      <P>The second point I wish to make is that I am totally against the new penalty points system which will not focus on those who should be targeted. The system will be another case of aiming for a simple target to bring in more money for the Government without dealing with the real problem. If I cannot swim, but I jump into a swimming pool, I will drown. Similarly, we allow 17 year olds to drive cars even though they have not been taught how to drive. There is no place for them to go to learn how to operate the most dangerous machinery in the world and many of them kill or are killed as a result. We are once more starting with the simplest plan in the world, to fine people and put them off the road. It is all about money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should establish centres where young people can learn how to drive. One <Col N="649" /> cannot get married without having attended a pre-marriage course so one should not be allowed on the road in a car, potentially to murder other motorists, if one does not know how to drive. A car is a weapon if it is not used properly. Driving schools should be set up in every corner of the country to instruct young people and to encourage good habits from the beginning. If this does not happen, one will get used to speeding and will not desist from this behaviour unless caught by the Garda. People are trained incorrectly from the beginning and pick up bad habits which are difficult to get rid of.</P>
    <P>There is a soft attitude towards drink driving in this country and judges can sometimes be too lenient. There is great sympathy for the drunkard. The attitude is, &ldquo;The poor fella, isn't it very sad that he has a drink problem&rdquo;. However, nothing is said when he gets into a car drunk and kills a young boy or girl. The reaction to such cases is that it is very sad as the individual has always had a problem with alcohol. Sympathy towards drunkards is the cause of many of our problems.</P>
    <P>We introduced legislation which made it easier for people to get drunk and stay out all night. The Minister of State received much criticism for his measures regarding taxis, but I compliment him as he was right. There were not enough taxis and he was right to deregulate the industry and to take action when the taxi industry was not prepared to do so. In the past people took chances with drink driving because they could not get taxis at night. The Minister of State's measures were necessary.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the NRA's practice over the past five or six years whereby yellow lines which mark the hard shoulder on good roads have been moved further out. The result of this practice is that two-lane roads have been reduced to a single lane. The Garda is very good at dealing with speeding offences, but I have never seen a garda take action against someone driving at 30 mph in a 60 mph zone. Such cars hold up other traffic, drivers become frustrated and try to overtake leading to accidents. What was the reason for the NRA's decision to move the yellow lines? This practice has meant that drivers move to the centre of the road and will not pull over to allow other traffic to overtake. The legislation should stipulate that slow drivers should be allowed to pull onto the hard shoulder to allow other traffic to overtake. This problem leads to frustration on the roads.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Government and every political party in this House are encouraging people to come to this country. They want people to come to this country and use our roads, yet the most common complaint made to Bord Fáilte over the past 20 years has concerned signage. Why are we against signage?</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for 20 years. An Taisce does not favour increased levels of signage but what is wrong with giving people clear directions? If one drives in England, <Col N="650" /> continental Europe, the US and elsewhere one notices that the roads signs are very simple. The Government, Bord Fáilte and everyone else is guilty of failing to erect proper signage. Accidents are caused by drivers getting lost, reversing and going down the wrong roads because of the lack of proper signage. It is time something was done about this problem.</P>
    <P>Members on all sides blame young drivers but I do not agree. I blame this and previous Governments for introducing legislation such as this without putting in place a mechanism to teach young people how to drive. My daughter wished to learn to drive. I advised her to go to a driving instructor but how is she to learn to drive without using the road? Training centres located in Castlebar, Galway, Westport or wherever would make it easy for young people to learn to drive properly.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question recently, and I will do so again, regarding the number of prosecutions. People are critical of drivers and they are right in some cases. However, one never hears criticism of pedestrians. One often has the experience of waiting at traffic lights and when one gets the green light three or four pedestrians walk across the road. If a driver hits a pedestrian, the driver is blamed even though he or she had a green light. There are few prosecutions of pedestrians who have a responsibility to observe red and green lights. However, one never sees them doing so. The attitude of pedestrians is that they can walk across the road if they so wish and that the law is on their side. I experienced such an incident on O'Connell Bridge recently when a pedestrian walked across the road in front of cars which had just been given the green light.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of the use of cameras. I recently tabled a question on these cameras which have taken in a record amount of revenue for the Government by way of fines. We should start at the beginning by putting the infrastructure in place, such as roads and training centres. Only then should penalties be put in place. However, it is an Irish solution to an Irish problem to start at the other end by crucifying the punter. That is what we are doing.</P>

    <P>The number of accidents seems to increase every week, particularly those involving young people. The Minister of State referred to the 12% reduction between 1997 and 2000, yet media reports seem to indicate that the accidents are <Col N="651" /> getting worse and more young people are dying. I have been through this trauma as my daughter was killed in a road accident three years ago. The sadness, trauma and sense of loss stay with a family forever and legislation which minimises the number of accidents and reduces the number of people killed on the roads has to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>One can never get the perfect system, but the two main problems seem to involve young drivers and drink driving. Deputy Ring suggested that we are being too lenient in dealing with drink driving offences. Despite the publicans' lobby it may be time to introduce a system whereby one does not drive at all if one drinks. We may be coming to this point as the majority of accidents, particularly those involving young people, can be traced to the weekends, discos and drink driving. We have to get tough on this issue and, as politicians, perhaps we have to make tougher decisions.</P>
    <P>Today young people have more money than in the past. When I was growing up it was rare for young people to have a car. The first car to which one aspired may have been an Austin A40, a Morris Minor or some banger which was not capable of travelling too fast. However, the majority of cars driven by young people have 2000 or 2001 registrations and are Fiat Puntos, Peugeots and other cars which are capable of high speeds.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahan suggested that a speed limiter could be installed in cars driven by young people to control their speed. There is no doubt that fast cars are dangerous weapons which cause the majority of accidents. Most young people are not experienced drivers. In my area many young people do not take driving lessons. In the past the high cost of insurance kept many young people off the road. However, they are now earning good money and can afford the insurance. They complain to politicians about the high cost of insurance and I agree, but it is not preventing an increasing number of young people from buying new cars. It is essential that young people have cars but they must also undergo proper training and testing. Before any person can get a provisional licence he should have to produce a certificate from a reputable school of motoring to say he has received at least ten or 12 driving lessons. One must produce a provisional licence in order to insure a car. One should also have to produce a certificate to show that one has clocked up a certain number of hours learning to drive before one can get a provisional licence. The Minister of State should examine this suggestion.</P>
    <P>The question of road accidents and manners on the road have become such serious problems that the subject should be introduced at second and third level education. The Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Education and Science should come together and initiate pilot schemes in an effort to encourage people to know the rules of the road and to improve the standard of driving on our roads.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority is penny-pinching on safety at major junctions. The authority <Col N="652" /> has refused to allocate money for public lighting at many accident-prone junctions. For many years there were frequent accidents at Scarawalsh in Enniscorthy. We argued with the National Roads Authority for a long time and eventually public lighting was installed at the junction. Since then the accident rate has dropped significantly. Public lighting at major junctions decreases the number of accidents and I ask the Minister of State to encourage the National Roads Authority to spend more money on this area.</P>

        <b>: </b>I did. I raised a few bob, and other things. The speed limit in Tucson is 60 miles per hour during the day and 45 miles per hour after nightfall. In large urban centres we could examine the possibility of dropping the night-time speed limit to a safer rate. The majority of accidents happen at night and there is a need to examine this idea.</P>
      <P>We all use mobile phones nowadays and many of us have become very careless in their use. They are used by bus drivers, lorry drivers and car drivers. Politicians use them at least as much as anyone else but we do not always use a hands-free system when driving. It is essential that the Minister of State look at the possibility of introducing an amendment to the Bill to allow only hands-free mobile phones to be used when driving. We may as well introduce such a measure this year as later. The use of mobile phones while driving is a cause of accidents and a major concern to the public. One sees bus and lorry drivers speaking on mobile phones while driving at 60 or 70 miles per hour, and the same is true of car drivers.</P>
      <P>We spend millions of pounds building new roads and then we spend further millions on traffic calming measures, traffic lights on roundabouts and other measures to make them safe. I often wonder about the sense of it all. The work of some engineers leaves a lot to be desired. Some traffic calming measures are no more than monstrosities and blights on the landscape. It is a waste of funds to build expensive road systems and within a short time to have to introduce traffic calming measures. This problem should be examined.</P>
      <P>I welcome the national car test, which is proving very successful. The new driving theory test is also a good idea. I ask the Minister of State to consider the introduction of a requirement that all applicants for a provisional driving licence produce a certificate from a reputable school of motoring to show that they have spent a number of hours learning to drive. This would ensure that safer people are driving on our roads.</P>

      <P>This Bill is long overdue. I am glad it has reached Second Stage and I hope it will have a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is not an exaggeration to say <Col N="653" /> that this Bill is a matter of life and death but I appreciate that constitutional issues, including the issue of the jurisdiction of the courts, had to be clarified, having regard to the provisions of the Bill and that this delayed things.  </P>
      <P>The level of deaths and injuries on our roads as a result of traffic accidents is shocking. The impact of tragic accidents on the families of victims if often enormous and unbearable. Every so often television pictures convey vividly to us the scale of the carnage in these accidents. Such pictures frighten us to the core, yet after we pause and reflect for a short time on the horrors of such accidents we gradually forget about them and get on with our lives and our business as usual. Given the way we act and behave, it is apparent that society accepts a certain level of death on our roads. Government must act on this and that is what this Bill is all about.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication and implementation of the Government's national road safety strategy, The Road to Safety &ndash; Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, and I acknowledge the progress made under this strategy. Between 1997 and 2000 the level of road deaths has fallen by 12.1% and the number of serious injuries has decreased by almost 25% during the same period. However, we cannot be complacent. Statistics of fatalities represent real people who were going about their normal everyday business when suddenly their lives were brought to a tragic end.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger has had a major impact on road safety. More cars on the road, more trucks, traffic jams, increased stress and faster and more powerful cars have resulted in bad driving, road rage and poor road manners. Drivers' behaviour has deteriorated in recent years and I am convinced the penalty points system will help to redress this major problem.</P>
      <P>The policy of the director of traffic for Dublin deliberately to reduce road space to facilitate non-existing public transport has not helped and has resulted in more road rage and aggressive driving. His policy is flawed and I believe that the motorist and public transport can both be facilitated at the same time in partnership.</P>
      <P>Sadly, the Irish experience is that drivers will not change their behaviour unless they are compelled to do so by tough laws and effective law enforcement. We will not change our behaviour voluntarily. The wearing of seat belts had to be made compulsory before people finally belted up; drink driving was only effectively tackled recently at Christmas time by intense Garda activity during the festive season; illegal parking in cities was stopped only when effective clamping was introduced and speed cameras were introduced to prevent speeding on our roads once and for all. The list goes on. The penalty points system is needed, therefore, to change behaviour further. In this regard, the experience of other countries is good. It has resulted in the improvement of driver behaviour and in a decrease in road deaths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation is to be complimented on the production of its road safety plan. It is effec<Col N="654" /> tive in many ways. As part of the plan, area-wide traffic calming schemes are under way. The corporation has also introduced the safer route to school programme, it implements the policies of the Dublin Road Safety Council and the traffic education school in Clontarf and the city warden service have been provided. All these are good things, but there are some flaws in the policy of Dublin Corporation. I question the safety design of some of the quality bus corridors and cycle routes which are being constructed in Dublin city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Commission's proposal to replace the existing variable ewe premium with a fixed premium of 21 per head was rejected by the Council at the meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers last week. The final Presidency compromise provided for the basic premium of 21 to be supplemented by the equivalent of 1 per head in the form of a national envelope. This compromise was rejected by some member states, including Ireland, as being insufficient and by other member states because it was too generous and too costly. A number of other member states also indicated that they would vote against any further increase in the sheepmeat budget, which would have been fixed at approximately 1.9 billion per annum if the Presidency compromise had been adopted.</P>
      <P>The six member states which voted against the Commission's proposal constitute 27 votes. A blocking minority is 26 votes. Therefore, it takes only one member state to change its vote for the present proposal to go through. This demonstrates the difficulties facing us in securing any improvement at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments proposed by the European Parliament included a premium of 30 for all eligible animals, an increase in the supplementary premium, additional payments through a national <Col N="657" /> envelope system and the exclusion of the first 15 livestock units of ewes for the purposes of the calculation of the extensification premium. These proposals, if adopted, would result in a substantial increase in expenditure on the sheepmeat regime and are unacceptable to the majority of member states, many of which are extremely concerned about the budgetary situation. They are also unacceptable to Commissioner Fischler.</P>
    <P>The negotiations on the reform are taking place in a context of serious budgetary concerns and a market situation in which sheep prices this year in Ireland are currently on average 40% higher than last year. The ewe premium this year is now likely to be below 10 per head. While I fully appreciate that the present price levels are the product of a particular situation, namely, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and the inability of British sheep to access the French market, they are, nevertheless, a factor in the current negotiations.</P>
    <P>During the year I used every possible argument to convince Commissioner Fischler and in bilateral meetings with my colleagues in the Council of the validity of Ireland's case for a higher premium. I will continue to press this case strongly but the outcome will be determined by a vote in the Council. However, the voting position in the Council is precarious and any improvement on the current proposal will be extremely difficult to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite the Minister to read the question. I did not ask him what happened at the Council of Ministers &ndash; we know that &ndash; I asked him what he is doing to ensure an improved proposal from the Commission on the next occasion and where we might get close to what the House, through the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, asked the Minister to bring back. Does the Minster agree that on the question of expenditure of the total agricultural budget, there is more than enough leeway left to cover the extra cost of the proposals, as agreed in the committee? Does he also accept that Commissioner Fischler indicated to the European Parliament that there might be a move, at least on the issue of the exclusion of the sheep equivalent of 15 livestock units from extensification? Is he taking any steps in direct discussion with his other colleagues on the Council of Ministers to secure an improvement in the situation next month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the sheep regime, first, there is adequate space in the budget to provide a significant increase in the ewe premium. Second, there is a deficit in sheepmeat in the European Union and, third, sheep production is generally in disadvantaged and less favoured areas of the Union. The Union favours multi-functional agriculture, so from all points of view and especially the socio-economic one, there is a good case for a substantial increase in the ewe premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In mixed herds of sheep and cattle there is a <Col N="658" /> very strong case for an extensification premium because if sheep are counted and no extensification premium is paid people will divert to cattle. There is a surplus of beef in the Community. For all of these reasons I engaged in bilateral talks and am continuing to do so. The French are closest to the Irish position but the difficulty is that the French Minister did not even wait for the conclusion of the meeting and did not participate. The French, the Portuguese and a range of other countries now want to support the 22 per head proposal. That is the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I see this proposed reform as giving us an opportunity to address some of the acute problems in the sheep regime, namely, an adequate premium, an extensificiation premium and support for a farming regime which is generally carried out in disadvantaged areas. It is clear that a majority of member states do not concur with that point of view. They view the current proposal as an adequate level of premium. The Commission tried to have this matter transferred from the Agriculture Council to the Fisheries Council this week. If that had happened, it would have gone through. Unanimity was required. I was the only Minister who objected to this proposal and it was not, therefore, taken at the Fisheries Council this week. It is up for consideration at the December Council of Agriculture Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>We had more than five million sheep in 1992, we are now down to 4.3 million sheep. That is a significant drop. Is it not the position that the European Union is only 75% self-sufficient? We had 52,000 sheep farmers in 1992 and are now down to 38,000, a drop of 14,000. The Minister is aware of the importance of the sheep industry as an integral part of dry-stock farming. Would he agree we are now on our own. Do we have any friends left in Europe? Is it the position that only Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Austria were on the same side and that the Swedes and Danes voted against the proposals because they thought it was too high? Does the Minister realise that the Danish Minister will row in with the Commission proposal so that the blocking minority will effectively be gone? Do we have anyone to support in this? Has the Minister spoken to the French Minister, Mr. Glavany? What contacts has the Minister had with the French? In a reply given to a colleague in this House on 13 November the Minister said he had only spoken with the Swedes, the Belgians, the <Col N="660" /> UK and Spain. What happened to the other ten members? </P>
      <P>If we do not bring our European colleagues on board we will not get anywhere. Is it the case that the Commission's proposal, if it goes to a meeting, will be rammed through unless we can get effective change prior to 19 December? </P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the position is as stated by Deputy Penrose. There is a deficit in sheepmeat production in the EU. There is adequate scope in the budget for the sheep regime to get an increase on what is already on the table. On a number of occasions I met the French Minister, Mr. Glavany who supported an increase in what was on the table. There was 20 on the table. When the Commission compromise was introduced, it was only increased by one to 21. In the course of the negotiations, a further 1 was put on the table by way of a package. At that stage, the French felt an adequate increase had been given and did not support the case for a further increase. That is still my case for all the reasons I have outlined. I continue with that position.</P>

Should we not get going at international and European Union level with the leaders to try to secure an improved deal? We are dancing at the last chance saloon for farmers.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The sheep regime is due for substantial reform. It was omitted from the Agenda 2000 negotiations. We have made a tremendously strong case in Europe for sheep farmers. We succeeded in getting the sheepmeat regime studied, the result of which was that the variable premium should be a fixed one. That principle was accepted. The difficulty then was to reach agreement on a fixed premium at a reasonable level. A reasonable level was generally regarded as about 30. What was put on the table <Col N="661" /> initially was 20 which has now been increased to 22. The Deputy is correct in saying that Portugal and Denmark no longer support an increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is essentially a public health issue and our approach to it must be governed by an acceptance of that principle while ensuring the availability of veterinary medicines.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board has recommended that intramammary antibiotic medicines should be brought under veterinary prescription control in light of current concerns about the development of antibiotic resistance in humans and animals. Pronouncements by major international bodies such as WHO on this issue include a specific recommendation that all antimicrobials used for disease control in food animals should be available only on prescription. Similarly, it is the stated EU policy that all antimicrobials should only be available on veterinary prescription. With one other exception, Ireland is the only member state where intramammary antibiotics are currently not subject to prescription control. In terms of cost and animal welfare concerns, it should be noted that the Irish Medicines Board has recognised the difficulties of applying the current prescription rules in Irish legislation to intramammaries. Accordingly, my Department is now engaged in considering what changes to existing legislation will be necessary in order to have an effective and workable prescription regime applying to intramammaries and has sought the views and suggestions of stakeholders on the optimum arrangements which might apply. Some stakeholders have already responded and I expect this process to be completed shortly. In formulating its proposals, the Department will not alone have regard to the views expressed by stakeholders, but will also have due regard to arrangements in operation in other member states of the EU where prescription regimes currently apply to intramammaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the second element of the question, I take it the Deputy is referring to proposals from the European Commission that all medicines for food producing animals should be subject to prescription control. This proposal, which is one part of a package of proposals from the Commission for reform of medicines legislation, has not yet been discussed in detail. In the absence of important detail, such as the principles which would govern prescribing activity and supply of medicines by veterinarians, the dispensing of prescriptions and also the specific range of products <Col N="662" /> which would come within the scope of the prescription requirement, it would not be appropriate for me to take an absolute position on the Commission's proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Irish Medicines Board, when asked last year if it could identify any human health problem or any animal health problem that would justify the kind of proposals it is making, replied &ldquo;No&rdquo;? Is the Minister aware that the only reason given by the Irish Medicines Board last year for what it was proposing was that it would be more convenient if everything were treated the same way? Is the Minister further aware that the other proposals to replace the intramammary route, now favoured by Irish farmers, involve intramuscular treatment which gives rise to greater concentrations of residues in the product? Does the Minister agree, therefore, that the standards we apply here, which have shown their benefit in terms of all forms of residue testing, somatic cell counts and so on, are perfectly adequate? If there is a need for harmonisation at European level, it should be on the basis of the system that we now have in operation in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's comments. The difficulty is that the Irish Medicines Board has made this recommendation and it could insist that intramammaries be put on prescription only. I consider this proposal by the Irish Medicines Board unworkable. It would involve a requirement for a veterinary surgeon to visit a farm and go into the milking parlour to ensure that a simple antibiotic, such as a mastitis control tube, was used. That is an absolute nonsense and I want to have a sensible arrangement which will address the concerns of &ndash; whatever about the Irish Medicines Board &ndash; a number of medical bodies and the World Health Organisation who have been alarmed at the extent of antibiotic resistance, especially among the human population. Some cognisance needs to be taken of that. I will ensure that whatever changes are brought about will be workable and will not interfere with the normal farming practice and, in particular, that the co-op structure and its branches will continue to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the general perception among farmers and the trade is that the Minister has already sold out in this matter by not objecting to the Irish Medicines Board's proposal last year? Is he aware that it would not be enough to have a vet at the end of a phone but that the owner of any decent sized herd would need to have a vet in the milking parlour? Is he aware that the IMB, the European Commission, the World Health Organisation and all other organisations which have made these proposals have been completely unable to point to any specific risk to human or animal health under the system we have in operation? If that is <Col N="663" /> the case, is it not nonsensical to proceed with any of these proposals? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the Agenda 2000 agreement, I secured an additional 32 million gallons of milk quota for Ireland. In determining criteria for the allocation of this quota, my main objective was to ensure that the quota was granted to small and medium sized producers as well as younger dairy farmers. In order to ensure that the additional quota allocations were fully utilised to the maximum effect, it was also a requirement for <Col N="664" /> eligibility that producers had shown their commitment to milk production by utilising their existing quota and by acquiring additional quota. Of the 32 million gallons, an initial amount of 20.5 million gallons was available for allocation with effect from April 2000. From this, 15 million gallons was allocated to over 21,000 small and medium sized producers. A further 5 million gallons was made available to younger small scale dairy farmers. In excess of 3,100 such farmers benefited.</P>
      <P>Of the 11.5 million gallons granted with effect from April 2001, I introduced a scheme for an additional allocation to the younger dairy farmers who had benefited from the 5 million gallon scheme and to certain other younger farmers who had commenced milk production at a later date. Approximately 3,500 younger dairy farmers benefited from this allocation. In view of the number of producers who were encountering quota difficulties because of the animal movement restrictions arising from the foot and mouth disease crisis, I decided to make the remaining 7.1 million gallons available on a temporary basis during the current quota year to alleviate the difficulty of such producers. This remaining 7.1 million gallons will be allocated on a permanent basis, with effect from April 2002, while the recipients or their successors remain in milk production. In allocating this quota I decided to make specific provision for milk producers whose initial quota allocations were low as a result of certain circumstances. In that regard, I decided that producers who had been following dairying development plans under the farm modernisation scheme and reduced interest subsidy scheme for farmers in financial difficulty and producers whose milk deliveries during 1983, the quota base year, were adversely affected by an outbreak of animal disease in their herd in the period 1978 to 1980, inclusive, would benefit under this scheme. In setting down the criteria for eligibility in the allocation of this 7.1 million gallons, I adhered to the objective of providing additional quota to active producers in the small and medium sized category who had demonstrated their commitment to milk production. These are the broad criteria which I have used in allocating all of the additional quota available to Ireland under Agenda 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should concentrate on answering the questions I asked rather than what was not asked. Most of his answer relates to questions which were not put to him. I asked specifically why the 7 million gallons, to which he referred in the end, are being allocated only to active milk producers. Is the Minister not aware that the claim by the milk quota rights group was either for milk quota or for compensation in lieu of milk quota, for which there are precedents? Does the Minister agree that a number of the people who made that application had been in milk production prior to 1983 but have since been forced out of it, either due to financial difficulties at that time or, since then, because of the cost of acquir<Col N="665" /> ing extra quota? Will he agree to review those cases and make some adequate equivalent form of compensation to those people who have suffered exactly the same problem as those who will benefit from the allocation of this seven million gallons? </P>

Why at the same time does he require that the milk producers who will benefit from it must have increased their quota at some time in the past three years either by buying or leasing extra quota? Why were those limits set and why did the Minister make this requirement for an increase in quota in one of the past three years?</P>

I am consistent in doing that in this case. That is the reason I have included that limit, which is the limit for the medium-sized producer. In the restructuring scheme approximately 80 million gallons of milk quota have been allocated in the past two years, which is as much as was allocated in the previous ten years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheehan is trying to address two different issues. One is a regulation in relation to the allocation of sheep quota that arose out of the overgrazing difficulty that the EU perceived in the commonages. The second is the division of commonage. The division of commonage is not necessarily the answer to the first problem because many commonages are not suitable for division. Where there are 30 farmers with commonage of 300 acres of hill, for example, and where the sheep need to range over the hill, dividing the commonage into simple mathematical ten acre plots does not solve the problem. Deputy Sheehan knows that hill sheep need a range to graze so division of commonage is not the solution to the first problem in many cases.</P>
      <P>The second issue the Deputy raises is the non-allocation of quota. If he puts down a parliamentary question on that issue, I will be happy to answer it.</P>

      <P>Neither he nor the other Ministers in the Department has done anything towards alleviating this problem. The farmers are crying out for the division of commonages and they are right. The farmers must stipulate on their area aid forms that they own a certain percentage of the commonage. Surely it is not beyond the capabilities of the Department to streamline this process and to abolish the commonage problem by returning the land to the respective farmers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheehan is usually a fair-minded man. I thought he would accept my comment today that if it became apparent that there was a demand for the division of a large number of commonages and that it would be gen<Col N="668" /> erally beneficial, I would be willing to look again at the issue. However, I must also stress, as the former manager of a sheep farmers' co-op, I am aware of the problems in hill sheep farming. It must also be stressed that division is not the solution to many commonage problems and every hill sheep farmer will agree with that.</P>
      <P>There are commonages that would suit division but there are many where division is not a practical solution to the problem. The sheep must have a large range of land to graze and where there are a large number of shareholders the division would result in parcels that were too small. Think of the hills that are common in the Deputy's part of the country and mine. If the land were to be divided into little blocks, the person with the little block on the top of the hill would not be able to carry on farming.</P>

      <P>I was born on a small mountain farm with 25 acres of commonage, which is still a commonage, so I know the commonage problem too well. If the area aid scheme insists that the farmers must show that they have a legal right to a certain percentage of commonage when they submit their area aid applications and where there is demand for subdivision of that commonage, the Minister should stop dilly-dallying and divide the land among the farmers concerned.</P>

What I said today is that where there is a demand, where there is agreement amongst the shareholders in the commonage and where it will be seen to be generally beneficial, I will look at the division of the commonage.

      <P>No BSE related restrictions on Irish beef or beef products have been imposed by the EU Commission or by any individual member state of the EU and I am satisfied, therefore, that beef exports have ready access to all EU markets. Nonetheless, reduced beef consumption in mainland Europe following the BSE crisis there late last year has had an adverse affect on Irish beef exports to those countries. While exports to continental markets have fallen substantially over the past year, I am happy to say that decline has been offset by increased beef exports to the UK. Exports to this market are running at about double last year's levels and the indications are that this level of trade will continue for the foreseeable future. Beef consumption in the EU as a whole is steadily recovering from the serious collapse in late 2000. This is due to a restoration of confidence in the product as a result of measures taken at EU level. Also, the schemes put in place to deal with the overhang of product on the market have had a useful effect in helping to restore balance. All of this will help Ireland's efforts to regain our former levels of sales to the markets in question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy launched by the Government earlier this week. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Among the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to the recent extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. The estimated cost of giving medical cards to all is about £800 million.</P>
      <P>Our first priority is the reduction of waiting lists, services for people with disabilities and for older people and also to ensure that those who had eligibility can actually gain access to the services to which they are entitled. In the broader context, the strategy emphasises fairness and the objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. A whole series of initiatives are outlined to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services. Shorter waiting times for public patients is prioritised as a fundamental issue of equity. There will be expansion of bed numbers and the introduction of a treatment purchase fund. In addition there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups including continued investment in services for people with disabilities and older people. There will be initiatives to improve the health of Travellers, homeless people, drug mis-users, asylum seekers, refugees and prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of the national anti-poverty <Col N="672" /> targets relating to health have been agreed with the working party and are contained in the health strategy. Access to primary care services is of crucial concern to the Government as is shown in the new primary care model that was so well received yesterday. There are many services that are now not as available as we would like and this model seeks to address the problem by putting in place co-ordinated, integrated one-stop-shops for services that will be of particular benefit to older people and medical card holders.</P>
    <P>The first step will be the further development of 24 hour, seven day GP co-operatives. This will be supported by the immediate establishment of a primary care task force to help drive the roll-out of the new model. The emphasis will be on putting together primary care teams which can effectively meet the needs of patients and clients. Patients will have the option of enrolling with these teams and with an individual general practitioner, if they so wish. They will also be able to self-refer to any member of the team. I believe this model offers the way forward in terms of primary care and it will change utterly the way in which we deliver primary care services and will also be hugely important in helping to streamline the delivery of patients and clients to more specialised services both within and beyond the community setting.</P>
    <P>The Government's record on improving services to older people in particular is second to none. This morning reference was made to the issue of social inclusion and social equity. Last July the medical card was extended to everybody over the age of 70. This extension is wholly consistent with the Government's policy towards improving the position of the elderly generally in society. It is a logical consequence of the three year phased doubling of income limits initiated in March 1999. In addition to that, the Government has stood over unprecedented increases in rates of payment for people relying on social welfare. This is much greater than anything the parties opposite ever even attempted.</P>
    <P>At £850 million, the package of social welfare improvements for 2001 is the biggest ever, and more than double the previous year's welfare package. The significant social welfare improvements which we have made amount to over £1.8 billion since the Government came to office. The value of the child benefit scheme, for example, is an effective mechanism for the provision of child income support and that is reflected in the substantial investment which the Government has made in the scheme. Before we came to office expenditure on child care was £397 million annually. Our first three budgets increased this to £575 million, an increase of more than 40%. Last year's increase of £25 and £30 per month in respect of child benefit rates represents a further full year investment in the scheme of approximately £330 million. Some 530,000 families with more than one million children will have benefited directly from the increases.</P>
    <P>In 2002 the Government's priorities for <Col N="673" /> improving the health system will be the provision of 650 additional acute hospital beds, addressing waiting lists through a new treatment purchase fund in addition to existing funding in the Estimates. We will also commence implementation of the new model of primary care, ongoing services for people with a disability and services for older people.</P>
    <P>The Government's record in relation to people on low income is excellent and I am proud to be part of it. The national anti-poverty strategy is the Government's major vehicle for addressing the needs of people in poverty who are experiencing social exclusion. Although health and health targets were not included in the original anti-poverty strategy published in 1997, my Department has been involved in setting and reviewing annual work plans for the national anti-poverty strategy. Recently the Government gave a commitment in the PPF to review the strategy across all Departments and to develop NAPS targets in the health area within an associated monitoring and implementation framework. In late 2000 the Department established a working group on NAPS and health which included the social partners and the Combat Poverty Agency and sought the assistance of the Institute of Public Health with the research and consultation aspects of the exercise.</P>

Will the Minister tell the House why, in his announced figure of £10 billion to be spent on the health service over <Col N="674" /> the next ten years, he could not find some money to increase the income limit for medical cards for the poorest? Is the Minister aware that in the ESRI research for males aged 55 and over, the death rate among poorer people is three times higher than it is for those who are better off because they cannot afford to go to the doctor?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that individuals with an income of over £5,200 must continue to pay every time they visit their GP and that a couple with two children must pay if their income exceeds £9,386? Is the Minister aware that in a recent survey of male patients in their 50s conducted by Professor Tom O'Dowd of TCD, 25% of patients reported that either they or a member of their family put off going to the doctor because of cost?

I have also prioritised issues pertaining to disabilities. The Opposition's record on disabilities in real terms of action and resources is shameful and dis<Col N="675" /> graceful. They have some neck to come into the House and lecture me or anybody on this side of the House about disabilities or anything else.</P>

      <P>Last week I was presented with the case of a family of six children where the father earned £300 per week. Two children needed to visit the doctor at a cost of £30 each and there was a cost for prescriptions on top of that. Does the Minister think it right that this family does not qualify for a medical card? Is the Minister living in the real world? I told these people I would try to appeal the case next year when the new guidelines came in and now I find out that the guidelines will not be changed.</P>
      <P>Last year the Minister provided that the over 70s would receive medical cards and I welcome that, but now families are being targeted and they cannot get medical cards. This is an outrageous state of affairs and it is time the Minister stopped the PR in his Department. All we heard for the past week was PR on the radio and television and the media was taken in by it. The people are waiting for the Government to do something about this matter. I challenge the Minister to allow people to answer him in terms of his strategy. The answer will result in the Minister sitting elsewhere rather than where he is now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it is an indictment of the Minister and the health services that this is the case. Does he agree that people are seeking care in hospitals as a result of not being able to gain access to primary care because their condition deteriorates to a level where they have no choice but to do so? That these people need and receive care in hospitals rather than at primary level has created <Col N="676" /> some of the difficulties behind the crisis in our hospitals.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister understand the angst suffered by many individuals and families in this State over the low threshold required for medical card qualification? Many people on marginal incomes and with great medical needs do not qualify. Is the Government's act of putting increased eligibility on the long finger a sign of things to come for the Minister's new health programme?</P>
      <P>There are many people who hoped, despite past disappointments, that the programme might mean a brighter future for them with better and more comprehensive health care for which more people would be eligible. Are they justified in thinking that, on the very first test within two days of the announcement of the programme, they are seeing chinks in the armour of this scheme? Are they right in thinking that the rowing back on this much needed reform points to the fact that the Minister's new health programme will suffer the same fate and that, far from being achieved in the next five to ten years, it will become a pipe dream. I will leave it there. I need a bit of a medical care myself at the moment.</P>

They are present in every area, none more so than in mental health which has been one of the great scandals of the past 30 years and over which Members of the <Col N="677" /> Opposition presided for many years.

      <P>In relation to Deputy Joe Higgins's remarks, I am fully aware of the difficulties people face. There are strong provisions, even in the case that Deputy Ring raised. Discretionary powers are available to chief executive officers to whom people must have recourse. There is a significant number of discretionary medical cards given out every year acknowledging that there are people with chronic medical conditions who require on-going medication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has described the Government's prioritisation measures as &ldquo;obscene&rdquo;. Would he not accept that the most extreme inequity in the health service is where poor families cannot afford to see their family doctor? Does he accept that his approach means that money will go into medical practices and the development of primary care, as a matter of his choice, rather than ensuring the working poor have a chance of getting a medical card? He must be aware that the medical card system is largely restricted to people on social welfare and that people on low incomes cannot afford to bring their children to the doctor without it having a major impact on their weekly household budget. <Col N="678" /> For example, a working man earning £324 gross per week would need to have ten children before he would qualify for a medical card.</P>

      <P>The Minister has levelled a charge of political opportunism at the Opposition. Would he make the same charge about the Irish Medical Organisation and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and is he aware of what they have said about his proposal? The IMO has accused him of bringing in an unacceptable measure that will undermine the health strategy's guiding principles of equity, access and fairness. It estimates that 250,000 people cannot afford treatment. Does he agree with that assessment or are they guilty of political opportunism too?</P>
      <P>Similarly, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul said they were &ldquo;shocked and incredulous at this obscene decision&rdquo;. It gives examples of people who will be bypassed. Would the Minister agree that, having launched the strategy with such razzmatazz, it has fallen at the first hurdle? He has failed to provide the equity and fairness that everyone in this House, at least on this side, wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that I raised a matter on the Adjournment about a situation where a young boy with a hole in his heart required an operation. At that time his family were being refused a medical card and did not subsequently get one. They had to travel to England to have the operation carried out. Is he aware that I wrote a letter, to which he replied, which raised the matter of a family where both spouses had long-term illnesses? The husband has a tumour and the wife a serious heart problem. They are married with two children, both working to pay their way &ndash; ordinary people, paying their mortgages &ndash; and they were advised by the health board that one of them should stop work so that they would qualify for a medical card. Those people have to drive to Dublin continuously for treatment and yet they are being refused a medical card.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied in his letter that they should re-apply. They did so a number of times but still got no card. I can see no reason people who are seriously ill are refused medical cards because of their incomes. When they are seriously ill they should be entitled to a medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister further aware that a person, living alone, who is under 66 has an income limit of £100 and that a single person under 66 living with his or her family is entitled to £89 per week? We are all aware that on £89 per week all one can do is keep body and soul together. Surely the level of eligibility should be widened. I ask the Minister whether he has lost touch with reality and the people because the people I meet are unable to pay their doctor. People are unable to pay the doctor the necessary fee in order to send them to hospital. The Minister should look at this. We are not making this a political issue. I would raise it regardless of what side of the House I was on <Col N="679" /> because to deprive people on low incomes of medical cards is a national outrage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the disparity in access to health care given that under the current arrangements the public sector is substantially subsiding the private sector to the disadvantage of those who do not have health insurance? It is unfair that the private sector contributes less than 10%, yet there is preferential access to health care for 40% of the population with health insurance. People who are paying are getting very little.</P>

It relates to the number of vulnerable people on very low incomes by any standard, who cannot get a medical card and who were led to believe by the Minister's proposals in recent days that they would be included. Is it not condemning his own proposals to the level of aspiration when it comes to the tangibles that real live families on low incomes, who badly need access to their family doctor, are deprived of even being able to consult their family doctor because they cannot afford the fees? Is that not the kind of tangible that matters rather than glossy presentations on aspirations for what might happen in three, five, seven or ten years' time?</P>

I would say to those who presided here prior to 1997 that nothing was done in terms of any substantial provision of additional places for people with disabilities.</P>

This has resulted in an unprecedented provision of places and prioritisation for people with disabilities. I continued the process last year and this year and it will be continued in 2002. That is tangible <Col N="680" /> under the health strategy. I would like to do a lot more but there are limits to what can be achieved in 2002. There are limits across the board.</P>

      <P>The House devolved the authority to the health boards who have the discretion to make medical cards available. Given the circumstances the Deputy outlined, I have no doubt that there should be utilisation of the discretionary clause. There was an agreement last year with the IMO to provide extra funding because of the numbers of discretionary cards in the system. The IMO complained bitterly about the numbers saying they needed recompense, which we provided for last year.</P>
      <P>The drugs payment scheme facilitates those who are chronically ill or are on a lot of medication and who do not qualify for a medical card. When the 1999 drugs payment scheme was introduced, it replaced the old drug expenditure recoupment by patients from health boards. No individual family need pay more than £42 per month for approved prescribed drugs. The take-up of the scheme has progressed dramatically as was pointed out yesterday because this Government has marketed the scheme more than its predecessors.</P>

      <P>In the year ending May 2001, the following increases took place. The number of people registered under the drug payment scheme increased by 250,000 to a total of 950,000. That is an increase per month of 43% and a total cost increase of 35%. Because of the new methodology in regard to forms, the chemist and so on, people who never applied in the past are now registering under the scheme. All those entitled have not yet registered. The numbers of people on different levels of income who are being assisted in meeting their medication costs far exceeds anything contemplated in the past.</P>

Forty per cent of the population is currently approximately 1.6 million people, of which 1.1 million are covered. However, 450,000 people could be covered under the existing agreement with the IMO if the Minister raised these absurdly low levels which are making poorer people sicker. These are the people who will occupy the beds and it has nothing to do with staffing. It has to do with the disagreement the Minister had with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise on the Adjournment the closure of Stonearch Limited, <Col N="682" /> Abbeyleix, County Laois. Employees were informed at approximately this time yesterday that their jobs were to be discontinued. Approximately 40 employees have worked in the company and my sympathy is with them and their families at this time. A number of employees were informed that they will leave the workforce next week and the following the week, and there will be a scaled closure of the plant, culminating in all employees being finished in the factory before the end of January 2002.</P>
      <P>Stonearch Limited which has been in Abbeyleix for more than 30 years was a good employer. It is involved in making vitamin K for animal feedstuff and it was assisted by the IDA many years ago. It is understood that the American parent company, which is quite small, has had a lot of trading difficulties, of which the plant in Abbeyleix is the main part of the group. People have recently seen the writing on the wall to some extent. From that point of view, I share the sadness of the people of Abbeyleix at the loss of their jobs in the run-up to Christmas. The fact that it was on the cards did not make it easier when people were told the bad news yesterday.</P>
      <P>I am raising the issue in the Dáil to try to ensure that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will instruct Enterprise Ireland and the IDA to contact directly the owners of the company to ensure there is a fair and substantial redundancy package offered to all employees who are losing their jobs. It was suggested to me that they will only be entitled to statutory redundancy but that should not be the case. The property in Abbeyleix is a very attractive building which includes a large area of land. As Members will be aware, Abbeyleix is on the main Dublin to Cork road, the N8, and the site is of particular attraction from that point of view.</P>
      <P>Over the years the workforce has been very loyal and it was a major source of disappointment when they were told yesterday evening that the factory was to close. I believe there is an acceptance of the inevitable that the factory will close. I do not believe there is any possibility of the operation being salvaged. I understand the IDA made contact with the company in recent weeks but found that it had no alternative at this time. When it comes to County Laois it is well documented that the IDA is an absolute, complete and abysmal failure. It has failed the people of County Laois for the last 30 years and has produced very few jobs. Tremendous work in locating jobs in the county has been done at local level through the enterprise board, Enterprise Ireland, Leader, local initiatives and various Government agencies such as the prison services and Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to Enterprise Ireland and the IDA to try to find a suitable company that will come to Abbeyleix, buy the premises and open a new business as soon as possible. We have a good, loyal workforce and a good tradition. Abbeyleix is a fine heritage town, an excellent area to do <Col N="683" /> business in and an attractive area to live in. The town needs replacement jobs. County Laois is in the BMW region and is the closest county to Dublin of that region. Attractive IDA grants can be availed of by any foreign company that comes into the area.</P>
    <P>The jobs task force set up after the job losses in County Laois two years ago when Avon Arlington closed in Portlaoise is now one of 22 such task forces around the country. It has achieved nothing. Many of the other 22 task forces have achieved precisely the same. There is no value in having 22 such task forces competing with each other. I ask the Minister to reassess those immediately as I have seen no concrete evidence of good work being done.

      <P>I fully support the Deputy's motion.

      <P>I apologise on behalf of the Tánaiste who is unavoidably absent.</P>
      <P>The company in question operates as a branch of Randstone Limited, a Bermuda registered company, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Heterochemical Corporation, Long Island, New York. Heterochemical Corporation was established in 1953 to take over the private business interests of Mr. William Galler. It was a private company owned and run solely by Mr. Galler until his death several years ago. It is now owned by his daughter Lynne Galler.</P>
      <P>Stonearch manufactures vitamin K active substances, which act as a blood-clotting factor and are regarded as an essential dietary requirement for animals. The Stonearch products are sold through Heterochemical Corporation to animal feed formulators. Stonearch has been operating in a niche market area with the vitamin K products. There are few competitors but a new entrant has moved into the market operating in Turkey and is selling to the market below Stonearch's cost price. In addition to this competition Stonearch would have to invest heavily in the Abbeyleix facility in order to comply with environmental and safety requirements in Ireland. The combination of market pressure and additional costs forced Heterochemical Corporation to consider selling the business. Negotiations were at an advanced stage with a company, which has a much stronger competitive advantage in the marketplace than Stonearch-Heterochemical. Unfortunately these negotiations were terminated yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reaction to the closure announcement, FÁS <Col N="684" /> proposes to meet with the company and all employees as a group. The full services of FÁS will be outlined to staff members and an immediate training programme of one week duration will be offered to them all. The one week training programme will allow staff to consider the training and employment options available to them and to decide which training programme they would like to pursue. This process will be activated by FÁS immediately staff are available. In addition to one week's training, each employee will have a one-to-one interview with a placement officer. As part of this training process, each employee will be equipped with techniques in developing CVs and in attending for interviews.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is committed to securing 50% of all new greenfield jobs for the Border midlands and western region of which Abbeyleix is part. This involves doubling the proportion of greenfield jobs negotiated for these regions. In an effort to ensure that this objective will be achieved, IDA Ireland initially reorganised its internal structures. This restructuring included allocation of additional staff to its regional offices and allocation of regional responsibilities to key executives in its headquarters project divisions. Up to one-third of all IDA staff will now be based in the regions. The purpose of these moves is to drive growth from within the regions. Other initiatives include a greater focus on marketing of the regions for specific sectors and improvement of marketing material for the regions. IDA Ireland's incentive package is strongly geared in favour of the Objective One regions which is in line with the new EU state aid limits. IDA Ireland will have 95 staff across all of its regional offices and the underlying purpose is to work in close partnership with the other state and local resources to create a drive from within the regions to pull foreign investment rather than the present approach of pushing for it from its Dublin headquarters.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of positive developments in Laois in recent times. IDA proposes to commence work on a 15,000 sq. ft. office facility on its business park in Portlaoise in early 2002. It also proposes to provide two further advance factories in the business park. Consultants have been appointed and planning permission will be sought in the first quarter of next year. In November last year, the Tánaiste announced a new project for Portlaoise. Ebm Industries Limited will locate in the 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory on the IDA's business and technology park in Portlaoise to manufacture cooling systems for the electronics and telecommunications industries. The project will employ 145 people over the next five years.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is working closely with its client companies and regional partners in developing and sustaining businesses in the area, enhancing the business environment in County Laois, encouraging new start-up companies with strong growth potential and in assisting Dublin based companies to locate their business expan<Col N="685" /> sions in this BMW region. I can assure the Deputy Fleming, and indeed Deputy Enright, that the development agencies will continue to market County Laois for further investment and that every effort will be made to secure alternative employment for the workers affected by this unfortunate closure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue.</P>
      <P>There is a need to construct extra classrooms, toilets and cloakrooms in Pallaskenry school, County Limerick. There is also a need for store and other facilities. As the proposal has been with the Department for over six years, this should be addressed as a matter of urgency in the construction and building programme which will be introduced shortly by the Department of Education and Science. Pupils are being catered for in two classrooms in totally unsuitable prefabricated buildings. A remedial teacher and resource teacher also work in the building. The buildings have been in use in the school for 15 years and for eight years prior to that elsewhere. It is unacceptable to allow children to be educated in such buildings. Everybody accepts it is unsuitable. It is unfair on teachers who cannot work properly in such conditions.</P>
      <P>While money was made available in 1997 to improve the buildings they are still totally unsuitable. The external walls are rotting, there is dry rot in the classrooms and the buildings are cold in winter and warm in summer. I have seen for myself that scaffolding bars have to be used to ensure that the roof does not collapse. Classes are obliged to be taken outdoors in warm weather because of the intense heat. There is no insulation and no toilet facilities. As a consequence, pupils are obliged to cross the main schoolyard to use toilet facilities and this creates enormous difficulties in wet weather. Pupils must cross from the permanent structure to the prefabricated buildings in similar conditions for remedial and resource teaching. I am sure the Minister of State will agree this is unsatisfactory. There are currently eight teachers in the school including a remedial and resource teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999 the board of management wrote to the Department of Education and Science seeking approval for the replacement of the prefabricated buildings. A full review of enrolment trends was undertaken by the planning section of the Department, following which it was considered the school's medium to long-term requirements were six permanent classrooms, a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation. In August 1996 the Department informed the board of management that they considered the provision of an <Col N="686" /> additional classroom, a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation would satisfy needs.</P>
    <P>Pallaskenry is a satellite town of Limerick. Its population has quadrupled over the past 20 years. A total of 163 pupils attend the school and the population will continue to rise as there is a proposal to provide sewerage schemes in the area, which will lead to enormous housing developments and, consequently, greater demand for educational facilities.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy is to develop towns and villages and, hopefully, Pallaskenry will benefit. Council housing estates have been built there in addition to development initiated by Aughinish Alumina. There also have been private developments. It is an attractive town to which more families will move.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the teachers who continue to work in such unsatisfactory conditions and the parents and children for their tolerance. Demonstrations often take places outside the Houses of the Oireachtas. The people of Pallaskenry will not do so as they will protest in a quiet and dignified fashion in an effort to have the school completed. I support the strong views of those people and ask the Minister of State to ensure Pallaskenry is included in next year's allocation of moneys.</P>
    <P>A sum of £20,000 was spent on prefabricated buildings in October 1997. At the time the Minister's officials in Tullamore gave me a guarantee that if this was accepted as an interim move by the board of management and the parents, it would not interfere in any way with the construction of new classrooms, which were and are still required. I plead with the Minister of State to respond to the real need of the pupils of Pallaskenry national school. I have witnessed the conditions and I am not being political on this issue. I am aware of the Minister of State's concern and I ask him to remember the school when money is being allocated next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Pallaskenry national school has a staffing level of principal, five mainstream classroom teachers and shared learning support and resource teachers. The enrolment at 30 September 2001 was 159 pupils. The school's present accommodation consists of four permanent classrooms in the main school building, a general purpose room, which is being used as a classroom, a staffroom, three temporary rooms and other limited ancillary accommodation.</P>
      <P>In July 2000, the Iong-term accommodation needs of this school were assessed and the Department approved the commencement of architectural planning for two additional permanent classrooms and appropriate ancillary accommodation. The initial drawings for a building project at the school were submitted to our Department by the school's design team and these were examined and approved last July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department wrote to the school authorities on 9 July 2001 authorising its design team to proceed to the next stage of the architectural <Col N="687" /> planning process. The Department is still awaiting the submission of documentation pertaining to the next stage of the planning process and when all relevant documentation has been received and considered the Department will communicate again with the board of management.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by the Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million, 470.44 million. This level of funding has enabled the Department to undertake a record number of building projects and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many years of neglect. The Deputy will further appreciate that, due to the volume of applications received for capital grants, not all deserving projects can be funded simultaneously. However, decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including the proposed project at Pallaskenry national school, will be taken as in previous years in the light of allocations made for school building purposes and when all budget decisions have been taken by the Government.</P>

      <P>I speak on behalf of the children in Huntstown, west Dublin. Their local primary school and its dedicated staff have provided a tremendous service over many years and have adopted a proactive and enlightened approach. The principal, the parents' committee and the staff have provided a great education for thousands of local students who have attended the school. They have also provided badly needed services for children from the Traveller community and, in recent years, the school has extended itself to cope with the new reality in society, which is the arrival of immigrants and children from many different cultural backgrounds.</P>
      <P>The school caters for children of 16 different nationalities. Naturally, this provides a huge challenge in terms of the special needs that must be addressed educationally, linguistically and culturally. The school also caters for children with special needs. A total of 455 children are being taught in prefabricated buildings, some of which are 12 years old and deteriorating, while 19 teachers work in very cramped conditions. Three of the resource teachers who cater for children with special needs work in conditions that are totally inadequate. In one case a teacher works in a classroom with no natural light whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffroom was built to accommodate 16 teachers but there are now 39 in the school and staff meetings cannot be held in it. The 14 permanent classrooms also need refurbishment and there are serious problems in regard to the playground. The school has applied to undertake a <Col N="688" /> significant new development comprising 16 new classrooms, a staffroom, a library, a physical education hall and resource rooms for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>Planning and work on this project commenced almost two years ago. The school has received planning permission and all tender documents, costings, etc., have been submitted to the Department for approval. Work costing almost £350,000 has been done on the project. Given the urgent needs of the school it is important that the project should be approved and allowed to proceed. The school is a crucial resource in a densely populated suburb of west Dublin, whose population is growing. The Minister has enough information to make a decision on the project, which is urgently needed. I urge him to inform the House of the date on which the project will commence.</P>

      <P>The school, as the Deputy outlined, has a staffing level of principal, 31 mainstream classroom teachers, two learning support teachers, one resource teacher and three other additional teachers. The enrolment at 30 September was 869 pupils. The school's present facilities consist of 16 permanent classrooms, 14 temporary classrooms, a general purpose room and other limited ancillary accommodation. My Department approved the commencement of architectural planning for 16 permanent classrooms, refurbishment of the existing school and the provision of appropriate ancillary accommodation. Architectural planning for the project is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including Huntstown national school, will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations made for school building purposes and when all budget decisions have been taken by the Government. My Department is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at Huntstown national school and I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important issue. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has issued a consultation paper which could result in the imposition of a national ban on bituminous coal, which is used by householders and petroleum coal, which is smokeless. This is a badly thought out proposal which will be totally impractical and ineffective. Such a ban will lead to fuel shortages, as suitable replacement solid fuels will not be available; higher prices, with increases of up to 25% for such fuels when they become available; and a loss of more than 1,000 jobs in the industry, of which 100 will be lost in Sligo-Leitrim. It will also lead to reduced choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB is threatening power cuts this winter and next winter. Electricity is needed for both gas <Col N="689" /> and oil appliances and power cuts will leave householders without heat and the option to use solid fuel. Natural gas is only an option in certain parts of the country and there is uncertainty regarding the price and supply of oil, as was evidenced last winter. The breakdown of the distribution network and the projected decline in sales will drive coalmen out of business and the elderly and low income groups will be the hardest hit as well as those living in rural areas. Consumers will face hardship as they try to find a coalman who is still in business to deliver fuel and are faced with higher fuel prices and getting used to new fuels. At the moment there is little or no fuel distribution in rural areas. The benefits of the proposed legislation seem insignificant. There is only a small lasting benefit to the environment from this ban as the burning of coal has a minor impact on air quality compared to traffic, power stations and industry. The Government commitments to reducing national emissions of sulphur will only be achieved by tackling the larger producers such as power generators and industry. Domestic solid fuel sulphur emissions are already small and are being reduced. The Government's proposal would deliver a minor improvement, less than 1.5% of the reductions required.</P>
    <P>Is there a problem with Ireland's air quality? In fact, it appears that Ireland's air quality is very good. This has been repeatedly commented upon in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports. It seems logical that the air quality in rural Ireland must be even better than the average air quality. There is a case for extension of the ban in urban areas, under proper controls, where it is deemed necessary but why must we ban fuels of choice in rural areas? Is air quality being monitored in rural areas? I doubt it. Is there an air quality problem in rural Ireland? Has any other country adopted a similar nationwide ban of bituminous or household coal?</P>
    <P>This is a very serious issue. There has been no consultation with the EPA which is on record as stating, in August 2000, that there is no air pollution problem associated with SO2, that emissions have improved considerably and that road traffic is the real offender.</P>
    <P>The issue is very important to the whole country but particularly to the most vulnerable of all in rural areas where buying coal and solid fuel is very important. The Minister should be aware of this from his own constituency. A national ban is an outrageous proposal. There is a case for an extension of the ban in certain city areas where there is a smoke problem but I believe the problem must be clearly monitored and action only taken on the basis of this.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the 1,500 jobs which could be lost nationally if this bituminous coal ban, which would eliminate the sale of household coal, is put into effect. It would be an outrageous move.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for the Environment and Local Govern<Col N="690" /> ment, which was unavoidable. I am pleased to be able to clarify for the House a misunderstanding on this matter. A national ban on bituminous coal and petroleum coke, or petcoke, has not been announced. A detailed consultation process has been initiated and full consideration will be given to all comments received before a decision is made by the Government. It is premature to assume what form the decision will take.</P>
      <P>On 17 October my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, issued a consultation paper on a potential national ban on bituminous coal and petcoke. The initial closing date for receipt of responses was Friday 16 November 2001. In response to the strongly stated wish of the industry to respond in a detailed and considered way, the Minister of State has indicated that he is willing to facilitate the Solid Fuel Industry Association and extend the consultation period.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that in keeping with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium the Minister of State extended the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal in 1998 and 2000 to a total of ten new urban areas. These are in addition to the bans already in place in Dublin and Cork when this Government entered into office. The localised bans have proved beneficial to people and to the environment but particularly to the more vulnerable sections of the community such as the young, the elderly and those suffering from respiratory illnesses. The Minister of State now feels that it is the right time to consider whether the ban should apply on a national basis.</P>
      <P>Ireland is also facing challenging targets on the reduction of overall national emissions of sulphur dioxide by 2010. We must reduce these emissions by 76% from 1990 levels under the Gothenburg Protocol and a directive on national emissions ceilings recently agreed between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Petcoke is a significant source of sulphur dioxide and thus discontinuing its use needs to be considered.</P>
      <P>I am aware that sections of the solid fuel trade have reacted strongly to the perceived threat to the industry. Their worries relate to jobs, the availability and distribution of fuels and potential price impacts. The Minister of State shares these concerns; hence, his is a real consultation process to identify the most suitable approach. However, the industry must recognise the need to ensure their products are most suited to protect health and the environment and the need to tackle emissions in a meaningful way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation paper puts forward proposals which are challenging for the trade. However, I am assured that progress is being made. All of the key areas including the availability and quality of alternative fuels and related issues, such as any transitional periods required, are being explored. We are confident that these vital issues can be teased out in a positive manner during the consultation process. We cannot simply replace dirty <Col N="691" /> fuels with other, higher-sulphur alternatives. We do not want to weaken the solid fuel trade or cause hardship or difficulties for consumers. The whole purpose of consultation is to explore all the issues and avenues available and to make <Col N="692" /> decisions based on informed debate. That is what the Minister of State is strongly promoting, and he will continue to work on this basis.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 4 December 2001.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that at present all slaughtered animals over 30 months of age, together with fallen animals and casualty animals over 24 months of age, which would be included in a cull <Col N="694" /> of the kind envisaged by the Deputy, are tested for BSE in any event. It is also the case that a substantial number of cows are being slaughtered under the EU special purchase scheme.</P>
    <P>While the number of BSE cases in 2001 is greater than last year's total, no case has been confirmed in any animal born after May 1996. In addition, the number of five year old cases detected to date this year &ndash; 32 to date &ndash; is well down on last year's level. This is an indication that the additional control measures adopted from 1996 onwards are having the desired effect and that the disease is beginning to work its way out of the system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 12 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>There will be approximately £24.6 million available from the national envelope under Agenda 2000 in 2002 for distribution among beef producers. This compares with £16.4 million available for the current year which was used to top-up the slaughter premium for beef breed heifers and to top-up the suckler cow premium in respect of replacement suckler cows in order to encourage a more rapid replacement of suckler cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultations on the allocation of the national envelope have just been completed between my Department and various farming organisations, some of whom have put forward specific proposals, including the prioritising of young farmers. While I support the objective of targeting young farmers and have implemented a range of <Col N="696" /> measures to achieve this, there are administrative difficulties which preclude the use of the national envelope in this way.</P>
    <P>I propose to continue with the top-up on the slaughter premium on the beef breed heifers which I introduced for 2000 to encourage quality beef production. I have also decided to retain the top-up on replacements within the context of the suckler cow premium scheme which I introduced for this year. The objective of this top-up is to encourage farmers to replace their suckler cows more rapidly than at present and so improve the overall quality of the breeding herd.</P>
    <P>I have decided to use the additional £8.2 million which becomes available for 2002 to top-up the suckler cow premium in respect of dry heifers submitted for the suckler cow premium up to a maximum of 15% of suckler cow quota held by producers.</P>
    <P>This approach will assist those farmers who will be affected by the more restrictive interpretation by the EU Commission of the new requirements on producers with 14 or more suckler cows to include heifers for at least 15% of their suckler cow application. The level of the top-up will depend on the number of eligible heifers submitted for the premium but should be at least £60 per head.</P>

      <P>The ministerial declaration agreed at the WTO ministerial conference, while not prejudging the outcome, commits WTO members to negotiations in relation to agriculture aimed at substantial improvements in market access, reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support. It also provides that special and differential treatment for developing countries shall be an integral part of all elements of the negotiations and that non-trade concerns will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The draft declaration originally proposed referred to, &ldquo;reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies.&rdquo;  This phraseology would have predetermined the outcome of the negotiations and was unacceptable to me for that reason. Due to the insistence of two EU member states in particular, France and Ireland, and against strong opposition from other WTO members, the phrase &ldquo;while not prejudging the outcome of the negotiations&rdquo; was inserted in the final text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the terms of the ministerial <Col N="697" /> declaration are in accordance with the EU's negotiating mandate on agriculture which was agreed by the Council of Ministers. This represents a most successful outcome to the Doha conference for the EU and for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The new round of negotiations is scheduled to commence in early 2002 and to conclude by 2005. It would not be appropriate to speculate on the outcome of the negotiations. However, in preparation for the future challenges and opportunities that may emerge for the Irish agriculture and food industries, I established in June 1999 a group to make recommendations on the development of those industries over the present decade. That group's report entitled Agri Food 2010 was completed in March 2000 and I approved and published a plan of action in August 2000 for the implementation of its recommendations.</P>
    <P>Substantial funding for many of the recommendations has been provided in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. I am confident, therefore, that the agriculture and food industries will be well prepared to cope with any increased competition on the domestic market and to exploit opportunities on export markets and so maximise their contribution to Irish wealth and employment and the development of rural areas over the next ten years.</P>

      <P>The fallen animal collection scheme was introduced on 1 July 2001. Based on the applications received to date in excess of 28,000 animals have been collected since its introduction. My information is that in the vast majority of cases animals are collected on the day on which they are notified to the licensed animal collector. In cases where the notification occurs late in the day collection is made the following day. Generally, on-farm deaths on a Saturday afternoon or Sunday will not be collected until Monday.</P>
      <P>The charges payable by a herd owner in respect of animals collected under the scheme are: £10, 12.70, plus VAT for animals up to six months of age; £15, 19.05, plus VAT for animals between six months and two years and £25, 31.74, plus VAT for animals over two years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significant increase in the volume of animals being collected and delivered for rendering has resulted in a comparable decrease in the number of licensed burials.

      <P>A total of 278,025 animals were slaughtered in Ireland under the EU purchase for destruction, PFD, scheme which ended on 30 June last. The EU special purchase, SPS, scheme replaced the PFD scheme and, to date, the carcases from 152,000 animals have been taken in by my Department under that scheme. As far as beef intervention is concerned, forequarter beef from about 54,000 animals has been taken in so far this year, while the full carcase was purchased in the case of a further 2,000 animals.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the PFD scheme to date has amounted to £198 million &ndash; purchasing costs of £160 million and expenditure on operating costs to date of £38 million &ndash; of which £97 million will be reimbursed by the EU under the terms of the co-financing arrangements governing that scheme. In the case of the SPS scheme, the total purchase cost of the carcases taken over by my Department amounts to about £61 million while expenditure to date on operating costs &ndash; takeover, rendering and storage &ndash; has been £5.1 million By virtue of the provisions of the EU regulation governing the SPS scheme, 70% of the purchase cost of the animals concerned is reimbursed by the EU. The prices at which carcases are purchased under the SPS scheme are fixed by the European Commission in Brussels on the advice of the management committee for beef and veal. Payments for product taken over under the scheme must be made by my Department within 65 days of the final date of takeover under each tender. The pricing and payment arrangements between participating slaughterhouses and their supplier farmers in respect of carcases presented for take-over under the scheme are, therefore, a commercial matter for those parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current text of the EU regulation governing the SPS scheme provides that the scheme shall apply until 31 December 2001. Having regard to the present market circumstances, I have asked Commissioner Fischler that the scheme be extended for the first quarter of 2002. He has undertaken to keep the market situation in the beef sector under review and to take any necessary measures in the context of the manage<Col N="699" /> ment committee for beef and veal. In the case of steers, the intervention system will continue to be available as a market support measure.</P>

      <P>In relation to TB, the main components in the spread of the disease are wildlife, animal to animal transmission, animal movements and poor farm management practices. The main factors in the spread of brucellosis are contiguity, animal movements and poor management practices including the management of manure.</P>
      <P>The eradication programmes in place are supported by research programmes encompassing diagnostic, epidemiological and wildlife investigation projects. These projects involve the collaboration of staff in my Department, Teagasc, the universities and other agencies.</P>
      <P>The veterinary, epidemiology and tuberculosis investigation unit based in the faculty of veterinary medicine, University College Dublin, provides direct support to the Department through the implementation of an agreed work plan that includes a wide range of epidemiological studies.

      <P>I referred to the scientific research in the UK on this which was subsequently found to be flawed; to the fact that there was insufficient time before the implementation of the decree on 1 January 2002 to put in place appropriate measures to ensure the continuance of the Irish lamb trade with France and that trials in Ireland of the equipment designed to remove spinal cord from lamb carcasses produced less than satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>Based on these concerns, I have requested the French authorities to withhold implementation of the decree pending further consideration of the matter by the EU scientific steering committee. Failing that, I have requested a postponement of the implementation of the decree to allow sufficient time for acceptable arrangements to be put in place so that traditional trade in lamb can continue between our countries.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to my Department's bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication programmes.</P>
      <P>The initial policy when the TB scheme was introduced in 1954 was to eradicate bovine TB from cattle herds and this still remains the objective. Significant progress was made in the earlier stages of the scheme but the programme has stalled, albeit at a relatively low level of the disease. However, given the experience in the past 30 years there is a recognition that the incidence of the disease in wildlife is a major impediment and that further technological advances will be needed to achieve further progress. An important short-term objective is to ensure that the incidence of the disease is reduced to an acceptable minimum so that markets, in particular export markets, are not jeopardised and so that there is no serious threat to human health. I am satisfied that these two objectives are being fully achieved. The anticipated number of reactors this year is 34,000 compared with 39,847 in 2000 and 44,903 in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Good progress was made in eradicating brucellosis in the initial 20 years of the programme <Col N="701" /> up to 1986, but there were setbacks in the programme over the next decade. The programme to combat the disease was again stepped up from 1996 and significant progress has been made since in reducing the incidence of the disease with the number of herds restricted to date in 2001 being less than 50% of the corresponding period in 1998. I am satisfied that the current programme, if maintained, will lead to the eradication of the disease in the medium term.</P>
    <P>Since the launch of the TB eradication scheme in 1954, and the brucellosis eradication scheme in 1966, the combined expenditure for both schemes has totalled £954 million &ndash; excluding administration costs &ndash; up to the end of 2000. The receipts for the same period totalled £429 million leaving a net expenditure of £525 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall strategy of the Government for the development of the beef, lamb and pigmeat sectors is to ensure that they realise their full potential, thereby maximising their contribution to the national economy. This strategy includes action on a range of fronts, particularly in relation to the production, processing and marketing of meat and is set out in the Agri-Food 2010 Plan of Action and in other strategy statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the beef sector is concerned, the overall objective of the plan of action is to enable the industry to recover and increase its presence on the EU market. To this end, the plan provides for an improvement in the quality of cattle through the introduction by the processing industry of appropriate price differentials to reward producers for quality production. The introduction of such differentials will be a condition of eligibility for grant aid for capital investment related to slaughtering capacity. My Department will also progress the introduction of mechanical classification to facilitate the introduction of a differentiated pricing structure. Better breeding is also to be encouraged through the activities of the ICBF and Teagasc. At the processing stage, the main strategy is to encourage the production of value added products and to improve the efficiency of processing through a process of rationalisation aimed at reducing the level of underused slaughtering capacity. This strategy is to be implemented through the national development plan which provides for priority to be given to capital investment aimed at the at rationalisation of slaughtering capacity and increased progress along the value added chain. As far as marketing <Col N="702" /> is concerned, the action plan envisages a continuation of the Bord Bia strategy to increase penetration of the high value EU retail market while maximising our returns from international markets. To ensure both adequate funding for the promotion of beef and the maximum flexibility in the use of these funds, the plan proposed that substantial additional funding should be provided mainly through voluntary contributions by the industry itself. For a variety of reasons, including the emergence of the BSE scares in the EU last year, it has not been possible to establish this voluntary fund.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sheep sector, the action plan provides for the implementation of the recommendations of the sheep forum. These recommendations are aimed at the improvement in the quality of sheep production through better breeding practices, the introduction of a traceability system and a quality assurance scheme for sheep and the promotion of Irish lamb on the French market. The monitoring committee which I set up to monitor the implementation of these recommendations has reported considerable progress on these areas. I would point in particular to the new sheep identification and tracing system, known as NSIS, provides for a modern and comprehensive traceability system for the sector.</P>
    <P>With regard to pigmeat, the strategic study of the pigmeat industry on the island of Ireland, which Minister Brid Rogers and I commissioned, identified rationalisation of slaughter capacity, scaling-up of plant size and better capacity utilisation as necessary prerequisites to positioning the industry to compete on national and export markets and to bring it into line with international best practice. The Agri-Food 2010 committee also identified rationalisation of processing capacity as an essential ingredient in achieving competitiveness. The Government's response to this report includes an undertaking that measures under the national development plan will include assistance for suitable projects put forward by the pig processing industry which are consistent with direction in which the industry needs to go in terms of structure of processing capacity, development of product portfolio and overall competitiveness. Pigmeat is also included in Bord Bia's publicly funded marketing promotion measures in this country and abroad.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am satisfied the measures set out in the agri-food plan of action will, if implemented, facilitate the development of the meat sectors, taking account of the wider EU and international context. I should point out, however, that many of these measures are the responsibility of the industry itself.</P>

    <P>In accordance with EU rules, only 60% advances were paid under the 1997, 1999 and 2000 cattle premium schemes. However, following the fallout under the BSE crisis in Europe late last year, a further 20% of premium was paid in December 2000 in respect of the 2000 cattle premium schemes. I was also successful in securing EU agreement to an 80% advance under this year's bovine premium schemes.</P>
    <P>The payment targets set out in the protocol on direct payments to farmers and previously in the charter of rights for farmers, are very specific and my Department has a good record in relation to their achievement, and indeed has surpassed them on a number of occasions. For example, full payments under the new 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme commenced on the agreed date of 21 September 2001 and over £162.5 million has been paid to date. With regard to the 2001 cattle premium schemes, 80% advance payments commenced on 26 October &ndash; the day the EU regulation giving effect to the increased rate of advance, was published. Some £144.5 million issued to beef farmers on 26 October 2001 and to date, over £183.7 million has been paid to beef farmers under these schemes. Full payments under the 2001 arable aid scheme commenced on 16 November &ndash; the date specified in EU regulations and in the protocol &ndash; and in excess of £94 million was paid to some 95 % of all applicants on that day.</P>
    <P>While an up-to-date comparison with other member states is not available, an earlier comparison showed that Ireland performed very well in the delivery of direct payments to Irish farmers. For most schemes, Ireland rated between one and five amongst the 15 member states in terms of early payment in the 1997/98 scheme year.</P>
    <P>

      <P>Information circulated by the UK authorities at the Standing Veterinary Committee on 21 November indicates that at 20 November 2001 there had been 2,030 outbreaks of foot and mouth disease confirmed in the United Kingdom since the epidemic began on 20 February. Of these cases, 2,026 were in Great Britain and four in Northern Ireland. The number of animals slaughtered on holdings where FMD has been confirmed, classed as dangerous contacts or which have been slaughtered on suspicion of FMD as at 20 November 2001 was 3,919,323.</P>
      <P>The last outbreak of FMD in England was confirmed on 30 September &ndash; eight weeks ago. The last outbreak of FMD in Wales was confirmed on 12 August-15 weeks ago and the last outbreak of FMD in Scotland was confirmed on 30 May &ndash; six months ago.</P>

    <P>Parts of the counties of Cumbria, North Yorkshire and Durham continue to be designated as <Col N="705" />&ldquo;High Risk&rdquo; while five other counties are designated as &ldquo;At Risk&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged by the continued absence of new outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Great Britain since 30 September. However, I still regard it as essential to maintain a precautionary approach in relation to this virulent disease. The need for continued caution is underlined by the fact that, contrary to expectations, outbreaks have occurred in Britain in the past, in areas deemed clear of the disease for a considerable period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 24 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>Some 278,025 animals were slaughtered in Ireland under the European Union purchase for destruction scheme, PFD scheme, which ended on 30 June last. The European Union special purchase scheme, SPS, replaced the PFD scheme and, to date, the carcasses from 152,000 animals have been taken in by my Department under that scheme. As far as beef intervention is concerned, forequarter beef from about 54,000 animals has been taken in so far this year, whilst the full carcass was purchased in the case of a further 2,000 animals.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the PFD scheme, to date, has amounted to £198 million, that is, purchasing costs of £160 million and expenditure on operating costs, to date, of £38 million, of which £97 million will be reimbursed by the EU under the terms of the co-financing arrangements governing that scheme. In the case of the SPS scheme, the total purchase cost of the carcasses taken over by my Department amounts to about £61 million while expenditure, to date, on operating costs, for example, takeover, rendering and storage has been £5.1 million. By virtue of the provisions of the European Union regulation governing the SPS scheme, 70% of the purchase cost of the animals concerned is reimbursed by the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prices at which carcasses are purchased under the SPS scheme are fixed by the European Commission in Brussels on the advice of the management committee for beef and veal. Payments <Col N="706" /> for product taken over under the scheme must be made by my Department within 65 days of the final date of takeover under each tender. The pricing and payment arrangements between participating slaughterhouses and their supplier farmers in respect of carcasses presented for take-over under the scheme are, therefore, a commercial matter for those parties.</P>
    <P>The current text of the EU regulation governing the SPS scheme provides that the scheme shall apply until 31 December 2001. Having regard to the present market circumstances, I have asked Commissioner Fischler that the scheme be extended for the first quarter of 2002. He has undertaken to keep the market situation in the beef sector under review and to take any necessary measures in the context of the management committee for beef and veal. In the case of steers, the intervention system will continue to be available as a market support measure.</P>

      <P>There were 2,541 suckler cow quota premium rights in the 2002 national reserve for distribution in 2001. Some 3,035 farmers applied for an allocation of reserve quota of which 332 have been allocated 2,449 premium rights. Queries relating to the applications of a further 36 applicants have yet to be resolved and the remaining 92 premium rights are held pending the resolution of those queries.</P>
      <P>The maximum national quota allowed under European Union regulations is 1,102,620 premium rights. The amount of quota available in the national reserve is the difference between that figure and the sum of the individual quotas held by farmers. The categories of farmers to whom priority should be given when allocating premium rights from the national reserve are determined annually.</P>
      <P>The quota review group, comprising representatives of the major farm organisations, that is, the IFA, ICMSA, Macra na Feirme, as well as representatives of Teagasc and this Department, met in July this year and put forward proposals, which I accepted, regarding allocations of suckler cow quota from the 2002 national reserve.</P>

      <P>In recent years Egypt has been our most important market for beef and, therefore, no effort was spared at political, diplomatic and technical level over the past number of months to have the market re-opened. On 7 October, I announced that the Egyptian authorities had that day published a decree to extend the existing European wide ban but in a major development the decree provided for an exemption for countries with BSE controls of the type operated by Ireland. This represented a major breakthrough which prepared the way for the long awaited reopening of the Egyptian market for Irish beef. Since then, all details requested by the Egyptian authorities have been provided and Egypt has now formally listed Ireland as a country which meets the required criteria for beef imports into Egypt.</P>
      <P>The question now of competing for contracts is a commercial matter for the exporters involved and it is not possible at this stage to say what volumes will be exported in 2001. I am, naturally, hopeful that Irish companies will compete to regain the level of market share they enjoyed in recent years in this important market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that more than 10,000 pigs were exported to Northern Ireland between 23 August 2001 and 16 November 2001. The rules which applied to these exports were the normal intra-Community rules which apply to trade in live animals between Members of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the foot and mouth disease crisis, trade in certain live animals to and from Northern Ireland, including pigs, was the subject of bilateral arrangements with the Northern authorities. Such arrangements, which were intended to facilitate the practical realities of legitimate trade in animals between both part of the island of Ireland, allowed for a degree of departure from intra-Community rules. With the onset of the foot and mouth disease crisis and clear evidence of an element of unlawful trade which took advantage of these arrangements, it was necessary to require that trade in animals between North and South be subject to intra-Community rules. I do not <Col N="708" /> consider it appropriate at this stage to revert to the pre foot and mouth disease crisis bilateral arrangements with the Northern authorities.</P>
    <P>The North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, has, as one of its stated objectives, the enhancement of co-operation in relation to animal health matters on both parts of the island of Ireland. Structures have been established to pursue this aim and activity is already under way in relation to the development of complementary identification and traceability systems, arrangements to prevent livestock-related fraud and illegal cross border trade in animals, the development of joint approaches to dealing with various animal diseases and a number of other areas. This work is continuing at all levels of contact between both administrations.</P>
    <P>In the context of the very close contacts which I and my officials have developed and maintain with our colleagues in Northern Ireland, I am aware that their views in relation to the application of intra-Community trade rules accord with my own. Until further notice, therefore, these rules will continue to apply to trade in pigs to and from Northern Ireland. Very careful joint consideration will be given to identifying and pursuing possibilities for better facilitating legitimate animal movements between North and South in the future in a manner which does not compromise the animal health status of North or South or of the island as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 28, 38, 41 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The European Union Commission's proposal to replace the existing variable ewe premium with a fixed premium of 21 per head was rejected by the Council at the meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers last week. The final Presidency compromise provided for the basic premium of 21 to be supplemented by the equivalent of 1 per head in the form of a national envelope. This compromise was rejected by some member states, including Ireland, as being insufficient and by other member states because it was too generous and too costly. There were also a number of other member states who had indicated that they would vote against any further increase in the sheepmeat budget which would have been fixed at approximately 1.9 billion per annum if the Presidency compromise had been adopted.</P>
      <P>The six member states who voted against the Commission's proposal constitutes 27 votes. A blocking minority is 26 votes. It takes only one member state to change its vote for the present proposal to go through. This demonstrates the difficulties facing us in securing any significant improvement at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in December.</P>
      <P>I saw the proposed reform as giving us an opportunity both to redress some of the problems which we have had with the sheepmeat regime over the years and to place the industry on a sound footing for the future. Sheep production is the closest we have to the European model of agriculture and I made a strong case in the negotiations for the premium to be fixed at a level which ensures that sheepmeat remains a viable farm enterprise. I also sought the introduction of an extensification premium for sheep to redress the unequal treatment of sheep producers within the cattle extensification system.</P>
      <P>In pursuit of these objectives, I have sought to convince Commissioner Fischler and my colleagues in the Council of the validity of Ireland's case both at the formal meetings of the Agriculture Council and in discussions with other Ministers. I have also discussed the reform of the sheepmeat regime in bilateral meetings with the Swedish, Spanish, Belgian and UK Ministers for Agriculture. My officials have also had ongoing discussions on the issue with their EU counterparts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negotiations on the reform are taking place in a context of serious budgetary concerns, a market situation in which sheep prices this year in Ireland are currently on average 40% higher than last year, and the ewe premium this year is now likely to be below 10 per head. While I fully appreciate that the present price levels are the product of a particular situation, they are nevertheless a factor in the current negotiations. It is clear that it will be difficult to secure any <Col N="710" /> improvement in the compromise which was rejected last week. The outcome will be determined by a vote in the Council of Ministers in December.</P>

      <P>Some 210 cases of BSE have been confirmed to date in 2001, up to 23 November, of which 26 were confirmed in October 2001. The number of confirmed cases of BSE has increased this year, as a result of the additional surveillance conducted on fallen and casualty animals over 24 months of age and animals over 30 months of age. Of the 210 cases confirmed this year, 72 were confirmed in fallen animals which would not, in any event, have been intended for the human food chain. Finally, it is noteworthy that despite the vastly increased levels of active surveillance this year &ndash; 549,170 tests &ndash; no case has been confirmed in an animal born after May 1996. This is a positive indication that the enhanced BSE controls introduced in 1996 are having the desired results.</P>

      <P>On 14 November a number of meetings were held in my Department with management of Greencore and Irish Sugar plc, in relation to the dispute between farmers and the company. Those meetings were held under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Davern. Separate but parallel meetings were held with IFA delegations. I regret that <Col N="712" /> agreement on the matter of price for this year's sugar beet crop could not be reached in the course of those meetings.</P>
      <P>Subsequently it was agreed by both sides to engage in further talks chaired by an independent mediator. After four days of talks from 21 to 24 November the mediator reported that the talks had reached an impasse. I am very disappointed at that outcome.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the Tánaiste and I met both sides yesterday. Various mechanisms for resolving the dispute were explored following detailed discussions, which went on late into the night. The Tánaiste and I put a proposal to both sides which we hope can provide a resolution to the current impasse. Both the IFA and Greencore have been asked to reflect on the proposal. Contact will be maintained with both sides. Neither I nor my officials have had meetings with staff or trade union representatives at the company.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to animals slaughtered in the context of foot and mouth disease. The slaughter of animals in the infected premises in Proleek and the precautionary cull of susceptible species in the Cooley Peninsula resulted in the slaughter of 48,744 sheep; 166 goats; 1,123 cattle; 2,908 pigs; and 280 deer, 117 farmed. Expenditure to date on compensation in the Cooley area amounts to £6,671,258 million.</P>
      <P>There were also animals slaughtered outside Cooley on a precautionary basis as follows: 3,826 sheep; two goats; and 857 cattle. Outside the Cooley area compensation payments, including payments to factories for meat condemned, amount to £1.07 million. Apart from this, other costs were incurred on slaughter, rendering, disposal and transport etc. If the Deputy is referring to animals slaughtered in the context of any other particular named disease, he might contact my office.</P>

      <P>The changes to the beef regime which were adopted by the Council <Col N="713" /> last June included a more restrictive application of any derogation from the 90 head limit on the special beef premium. In future, any such derogation must be based on objective criteria that are part of rural development policy and take into account environmental and employment aspects.</P>
      <P>I recently announced that, following communication with the EU Commission, I had decided to avail of the derogation provided for in the EU regulation and to fix the headage limit at 180 head for each instalment of the premium for 2002 to encourage the development of commercially viable beef enterprises.</P>
      <P>I believe that this approach is consistent with the Government's strategy for rural development which is to maintain the maximum number of viable farms in the country. The environmental requirements relating to the derogation will be enforced through the implementation of the existing stocking density limits and compliance with the principles of good farming practice which apply to all producers wishing to benefit from the premium system.</P>

I have also included the area which had a full cull of livestock due to foot and mouth disease recently, the Cooley Peninsula. The areas selected include parts of all the counties of Connacht-Ulster, parts of five counties in Munster and parts of four counties in Leinster. The average population loss in all these areas is 50% and the total population that will benefit from the programme is 283,000.</P>

      <P>On 7 October I announced that the Egyptian authorities had that day published a decree to extend the existing European wide ban but, in a major development, the decree provided for an exemption for countries with BSE controls of the type operated by Ireland. This represented a major breakthrough which prepared the way for the long awaited reopening of the Egyptian market for Irish beef and followed intensive contact at political, diplomatic and technical level over the past number of months between Ireland and Egypt.</P>
      <P>Since then contacts have been taking place between our Embassy in Cairo and the Egyptian authorities on matters relating to certification, specification and terms of supply. Commercial contacts have also taken place between importers and the authorities in Egypt. All details requested by the Egyptian authorities have been provided and the Egyptian authorities have now formally listed Ireland as a country which meets the required criteria for beef imports into Egypt.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the Egyptian authorities have stated that they will permit beef imports on condition that the beef is derived from cattle from which the specified risk material has been removed, which are fully traceable, which test negatively for BSE, which have never been fed ruminant MBM and must only come from farms in which no case of BSE has occurred in the past three years. Animals must be less than 24 months old, based on routine dentition checks. Premises exporting beef to Egypt will also be subject to inspection by Egyptian veterinary officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the Irish Embassy in Cairo that <Col N="715" /> Egyptian importers have to date applied for 15 import licences. The question of competing for contracts is a commercial matter for the exporters involved and I am, naturally, hopeful that Irish companies will compete to regain the level of market share they enjoyed in recent years in this important market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that applicants under the 2001 suckler cow premium schemes had the option of applying on heifers up to a maximum of 20% of the total number of animals for which premium was requested. Clause 20 of the terms and conditions of the scheme states that a cow &ldquo;is a bovine animal that has calved at least once already&rdquo; and a heifer is defined as &ldquo;at least eight months old at date of application&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The status of any animal applied on at the date of application is the relevant issue and which must be considered for the purposes of the scheme. In-calf heifers cannot be regarded as cows even if they are near calving or where they have calved after the application has been lodged but prior to the official closing date of the scheme. Clause 23 of the terms and conditions states that, in order to avoid penalties, applicants should ensure that they have completed the application form in accordance with the provisions as set out under Clause 20.</P>
      <P>The suckler cow premium scheme is fully financed by the EU and it is essential that my Department take appropriate steps to ensure that the EU regulations governing the scheme are implemented.</P>
      <P>All applications under the bovine schemes are cross-checked against the details contained in my Department's cattle movement monitoring system's database. These checks have shown that, in a number of cases, applicants declared animals as cows on the application form when in fact they were heifers at the date of application. In these cases my Department follows up on the error by writing to the applicant, setting out the details concerning the error and seeking an explanation. On the basis of the information received from the applicants, a decision is taken on each case based on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a decision is taken to apply a penalty, the applicant is advised of the position in writing. <Col N="716" /> He is given the opportunity of having the decision reviewed by writing to an officer of my Department at a grade higher than that of the officer who took the decision. In the event that the review is unsuccessful, the applicant is again advised in writing and is given the opportunity of appealing the decision by writing to the independent headage and premia appeals unit where the case is examined afresh.</P>

      <P>The ministerial declaration agreed at the WTO ministerial conference, while not prejudging the outcome, commits WTO members to negotiations in relation to agriculture aimed at substantial improvements in market access, reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support. It also provides that special and differential treatment for developing countries shall be an integral part of all elements of the negotiations and that non-trade concerns will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The draft declaration originally proposed referred to &ldquo;reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies&rdquo;. This phraseology would have predetermined the outcome of the negotiations and was unacceptable to me for that reason. Due to the insistence of two EU member states in particular, France and Ireland, and against strong opposition from other WTO Members, the phrase &ldquo;while not prejudging the outcome of the negotiations&rdquo; was inserted in the final text. I am satisfied that the terms of the ministerial declaration are in accordance with the EU's negotiating mandate on agriculture which was agreed by the Council of Ministers. This represents a most successful outcome to the Doha conference for the EU and for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Commission negotiates for the EU in the WTO. However, the EU Council of Ministers met on a daily basis in Doha to review progress in the negotiations and to discuss and decide on the EU's position as the negotiations progressed. I participated in the Council meetings and my officials and I were also in constant contact with Commissioner Fischler and his officials and with representatives of other member states with a view to ensuring a satisfactory outcome <Col N="717" /> from Ireland's point of view. The new round of negotiations is scheduled to conclude by 2005. It would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome.</P>

Each of our important export markets, including Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, is being dealt with in whatever way is most appropriate to the circumstances prevailing in that market. The strategy adopted in each case is kept under constant review by my Department having regard to advice from our embassies in the countries concerned and from Bord Bia.</P>
      <P>Opportunities afforded by ministerial visits to the region were availed of to press Ireland's case for a reopening of those markets. Furthermore, a senior veterinary official of my Department visited Saudi Arabia and a number of Gulf states earlier this year to follow up on contacts with the relevant authorities in those countries to brief them on developments in relation to BSE and to outline the guarantees which can be offered to consumers of Irish beef. Last month a number of meetings were held in the Irish Embassy in Riyadh with the importing agencies with a view to progressing the effort to reopen the market. We will continue to press for re-opening of beef markets at every possible opportunity and I am confident that our recent success with the Egyptian market, our largest market, will encourage other markets in the region to follow suit.</P>

      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain-type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas, was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain-type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain-type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system, regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> The new area-based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped &ndash; lowland &ndash; £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped &ndash; lowland &ndash; £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; mountain-type land &ndash; £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
    <P>Following a thorough review of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have now been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain-type land. The proposal involves making a payment of £80 per hectare on the first 10 hectares of mountain-type land with a payment of £70 per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will take effect in the current year.</P>

      <P>An epidemiological investigation is carried out in the case of all BSE suspects, which are notified to my Department whether these animals are confirmed positive or negative. In addition, an epidemiological investigation is carried in the case of all animals, which test positive under Ireland's active surveillance programme. The principal epidemiological features identified by these investigations are as follows: all cases diagnosed to date have been born in or before May 1996, which is prior to the introduction of additional controls on the utilisation of MBM at the end of 1996. This is a positive indication that the enhanced BSE controls introduced are having the desired effect. The majority of cases in all years have been diagnosed in the 5 and 6 year-old category. However, this year has seen a shift in the age profile of cases towards the older age groups. Whereas in previous years the majority of cases had been diagnosed in the 5 year old category, this year the majority of cases have been diagnosed in the 6 year old age category with an increase in the percentage of seven and eight year olds compared to earlier years. Again, this is a favourable sign that younger animals have not been exposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of cases to date have occurred in Friesian cows and in dairy herds. In the majority <Col N="720" /> of cases, the positive animal has been recorded as having received concentrate feeding in the first two years of life and it is assumed that positive animals have been exposed to infection through the cross contamination of such feeds. However, it is not possible to conclusively prove such exposure in retrospect and having regard to the passage of time between possible exposure and confirmation of cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The abolition of export refunds on live cattle was raised by Germany at the meeting of the agriculture Council of Ministers last week and was supported by a number of other member states. I objected strongly to the German suggestion, which would effectively terminate a perfectly legitimate trade which is of considerable importance to Irish producers in view of our dependence on export markets and the need to provide competition in the market place for cattle.</P>
      <P>While the slaughtering of animals close to production would be the ideal, the fact is that the demand is for live animals rather than for beef in many of our export markets. The reality, of course, is that if EU countries do not supply these markets, the gap will be filled by non-EU countries where animal welfare standards are not as rigorous, with a consequent worsening of conditions for animals being exported. In that situation, the overall welfare of cattle in international trade would suffer.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the animal welfare concerns surrounding the transport of animals both within and outside the European Union and I am satisfied that the measures now in place, such as the linking of the payment of export refunds to compliance with animal welfare rules, ensure that the transport of animals to third countries takes place only in accordance with the highest animal welfare standards. In addition, I have put in place a rigorous and detailed statutory inspection process for approving vessels to carry livestock. I am satisfied that transport by sea does not adversely affect animals if the strict measures are complied with and properly policed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, welfare standards are constantly evolving and I am, of course, prepared to work towards any further improvements in standards that might be considered necessary. Also, where there have been breaches of existing rules in particular cases, improved monitoring and prosecution of those who are culpable is the appropriate course of action. The abolition of export <Col N="721" /> refunds on live cattle would be a blunt instrument and would adversely affect farmers in the EU while the overall welfare of animals in world trade would deteriorate. For these reasons, I will continue to oppose the removal of export refunds on live exports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any brain samples taken from sheep which have tested positive for BSE under normal conditions, although sheep have been infected with the disease under experimental conditions in the UK.</P>
      <P>The view of the scientific steering committee of the European Commission on this matter on 24 October 2001, was that there was no evidence that BSE was present in small ruminants under field conditions. However, the committee also indicated that the possibility that sheep which had been fed with meat and bone meal in the past might potentially be infected with BSE could not be ruled out. In this regard research undertaken in the UK on brain tissue taken from sheep in the early 1990s has been invalidated because it appears that the samples analysed in the course of this research may, in fact, have been tissues of bovine rather than ovine origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country, strain typing conducted in relation to a small number of sheep has not yielded any evidence that BSE is present in the sheep flock. Taking all of the above into account and discounting BSE infectivity induced in lab<Col N="722" /> oratory conditions, there is to date no evidence of BSE in sheep, in this country or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>While scrapie has been present in sheep in this country for some 200 years, there is a low incidence of the disease. It is, however, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, TSE, and notwithstanding the lack of scientific evidence linking it to BSE or CJD in humans, it may give rise to a subliminal concern on the part of consumers. For this reason, at least as much as any other, it is desirable that we seek to eradicate the disease from the national flock. The controls relevant to scrapie which are currently in operation, for example, the ban on meat and bone meal, removal of specified risk materials, testing at meat factories, research into developing genetically resistant sheep and strain typing research, have been developed in the context of controls on TSEs generally, including BSE.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ireland has had an active surveillance programme for scrapie since 1998, testing approximately 8,000 sheep at factories each year since then. The European Commission requires member states to increase the level of testing next year and in Ireland this means that approximately 15,000 tests must be performed in 2002. In fact, it is likely that we will perform a substantially higher number of tests.</P>
    <P>The introduction on 1 June 2001 of a national sheep identification scheme, involving individual tagging of sheep, will add significantly to the level of traceability and will assist greatly in the development of disease monitoring and eradication programmes in relation to sheep in Ireland. Acknowledging the desirability of eradicating scrapie from the national flock, I have decided to substantially expand my Department's programme for the control and eradication of scrapie. To that end, flocks which have had cases of scrapie since 1999 have been restricted and will be culled. Other flocks which have a history of scrapie are being examined and may also be slaughtered out. This depopulation component, which offers an effective means of addressing known cases of scrapie in the short term, complements the medium term element of enhanced testing and the longer term element of genetic research, all of which are components of our approach to effectively addressing the eradication of the disease.</P>
    <P>Against the background I have described above, and taking into account the concerns of consumers and the future wellbeing of our sheep sector, I believe that our current controls and the course of action upon which we are now embarked are appropriate in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>Chapter 3, Part 23 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, was introduced by the Finance Act, 2000, and enables capital allowances to be claimed in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred on the purchase of a milk quota under a milk quota restructuring scheme or on expiry of certain land and milk quota leases on or after 6 April 2000. Following completion of consultations with the European Commission by the Department of Finance and my Department, a ministerial order was recently signed which activated the commencement of these provisions.</P>
      <P>The main mechanisms for acquiring additional quota under the revised regime introduced with effect from April 2000 are restructuring schemes and purchase of leased quota on expiry of a land and quota lease. In excess of 15,000 dairy farmers purchased quota under the 2000 milk quota restructuring scheme while approximately 11,200 producers purchased quota under the 2001 scheme. In addition, in excess of 1,000 producers purchased the leased quota on expiry or earlier termination of a land and quota lease agreement. Without having detailed information on each producer's assessment of income tax liability, it is not possible to estimate the amount of relief that will be granted under this scheme. The number of producers referred to above, however, gives an indication of the potential beneficiaries under this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to Deputy Durkan in my response to a similar question from him on 6 November last, I believe that the vast majority of traders want to behave honourably and responsibly during the changeover to the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the euro should not, of itself, require any trader to increase prices. Of course, it is open to any business to increase their prices if they want to do so. In the absence of a strict regime of price control that would require all price adjustments to be approved in advance, there is no way of proving whether such increases are justified. Likewise, it is open to traders to decrease prices, as presumably many will, during <Col N="725" /> the period of the post-Christmas sales. This is the norm in an open competitive market.</P>
    <P>Retailers, in particular, will be in the front line during the changeover process and will have a crucial role to play in facilitating acceptance of the euro by consumers. The retail market is highly competitive and at the end of the day those who seek to take advantage of the introduction of the euro by introducing unwarranted price increases will be punished by the market. Consumers need to realise the power they themselves have if they feel they are not being treated fairly and that is to take their business elsewhere. This is the ultimate sanction for any trader who seeks to take advantage of the changeover.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that dual display of prices is the key to helping consumers and traders alike prepare for, and become more confident in, using the euro. Through exposure to dual display consumers can compare prices between Irish punts and euros and build up a scale of values for themselves in the new currency. That is the objective of the national code of practice on dual display of prices. The benefits of co-operating together to ensure the smooth introduction of the euro have also been recognised by the groups of traders who participated in drawing up their own sectoral codes of practice on dual display of prices.</P>
    <P>The large numbers of traders who have already signed up to the codes of practice are entitled to display a special logo approved by the Director of Consumer Affairs as evidence of a commitment to carry out the changeover fairly. These traders recognise that it makes good business sense to be in a position to demonstrate to their customers that they have made a commitment not to seek any unfair advantage from the changeover. I strongly urge retailers who have not yet done so to contact their trade association or the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, without any further delay, and sign up to one of the codes of practice.</P>

      <P>On my recent visit to Chile I was accompanied by my Secretary General, a senior official of my Department, my private secretary, the chairman and chief executive of BIM and an Irish salmon farmer. The purpose of the trip was to gain a deeper understanding of the Chilean salmon industry, in particular, those factors which have enabled very significant growth in their industry in recent years.

      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the suffering caused by the civil conflict in Algeria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts by the Algerian authorities and a number of opposition groups to end the conflict continue, despite opposition by some forces to any settlement or reconciliation between the Government and its Islamist opponents. The situation has deteriorated in recent months after an improvement following the implementation of the general amnesty announced by President Bouteflika last year. Ireland, together with our EU partners, supports efforts to achieve a process of genuine political dialogue in Algeria. In a statement during the UN Third Committee <Col N="730" /> debate on human rights, the EU expressed cautious support for initiatives by the Algerian authorities in the areas of political, social and economic reform, but also underlined the need for a greater respect for human rights by the security forces.</P>
    <P>The EU supports economic and social reforms which tackle poverty, deprivation and exclusion, all of which serve to perpetuate the violence. To this end it is working with Algeria through the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and has urged Algeria to implement the commitments it accepted in the Barcelona Declaration for the development of democracy and the rule of law, and to respect and protect human rights. These are priority areas in negotiations with Algeria on a draft Association Agreement under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. Ireland would like to see an Agreement in which closer economic cooperation is linked to the process of political reform and respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>Ireland attaches particular importance to human rights issues in our bilateral relations with Algeria. We have urged the Algerian authorities to establish independent mechanisms for the investigation of human rights violations and to bring those responsible to justice. We would like to see Algeria accede to the requests for visits by the UN Special Human Rights Rapporteurs on Torture and Extrajudicial Executions.</P>
    <P>The Government have noted the constructive action taken by the Algerian authorities in response to the recent critical report and recommendations of an independent inquiry established by President Bouteflika into the causes of the unrest in the Berber region of Kabylie. The Government hope there will be further follow-up action to those recommendations. We hope that the Algerian authorities will now go on to establish similar, independent mechanisms to investigate allegations of human rights abuses arising from the wider civil conflict in the country.</P>

      <P>The question now of competing for contracts and complying with the requirement to have all animals for the Egyptian market test negatively for BSE is a commercial matter for the exporters involved.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced in March of this year my intention to introduce a compre<Col N="733" /> hensive system of identification and traceability for the national sheep flock. The first elements of the new system were in place within two months, with flockowners able to order and receive tags from approved suppliers. The national sheep identification system &ndash; NSIS &ndash; as a whole went &ldquo;live&rdquo; on 21 June. For the first time, Ireland has full traceability of all sheep, on an individual animal basis. Every sheep which moves from a holding within the State or which is imported into the State and every sheep carcass processed in any of our processing plants is now fully and individually identified. All sheep remaining on holdings are required to be individually tagged by 15 December next.</P>
      <P>I attach great importance to this development which is of significant benefit to the sheep sector, most notably in terms of disease control, marketing and in the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the sheepmeat forum. I believe that many flockowners are already beginning to appreciate the benefits of individual tagging for flock management purposes also.</P>
      <P>My Department is monitoring the implementation of NSIS on an ongoing basis and I am pleased to report that the system is working well and that sheep presented in marts and factories are properly tagged and documented. The glut of tag orders which occurred last June was short-lived. Approved tag supply companies are now filling orders in a matter of days. To date, almost 10 million tags have been issued to more than 41,000 flockowners.</P>
      <P>I am therefore satisfied with progress to date in introducing NSIS. I look forward to full compliance by flockowners with the requirement that all sheep remaining on holdings are tagged no later than 15 December next. Compliance with all the requirements of NSIS will be subject to monitoring by the Department at farm, mart and meat levels and in relation to the operations of other interested parties.</P>

To date over 41,000 flockowners have purchased 9.8 million sheep tags. Two million of these were short-term tags which can be used only for lambs moving directly from farm to factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department holds full information on tag purchase and supply, by flockowner. This information is monitored in conjunction with spot checks by Departmental staff at marts and factories.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>As regards intra-mammary preparations, the Irish Medicines Board has recommended that these antibiotic medicines should be brought under prescription control. It is recognised in the relevant report from the IMB that there would be difficulties in applying the current prescription rules in Irish legislation to intramammaries. Accordingly, and in the context of the IMB proceeding with the prescription route, my Department is now engaged in considering what changes to existing legislation will be necessary in order to have an effective and workable prescription regime applying to intramammaries. My Department has sought the views and suggestions of stakeholders on the optimum arrangements which might apply. Some stakeholders have already responded and I expect this process to be completed within coming weeks. In formulating its proposals, my Department will not alone have regard to the views expressed by stakeholders, within the context of putting in place a suitable prescription regime but will also have due regard to arrangements in operation in other member states of the EU where prescription regimes currently apply to intramammaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards animal vaccines, I do not have a general policy that these products should necessarily be brought under prescription control. The current situation is that the marketing authorisations for animal vaccines are being reviewed on an individual basis in order to bring the licensing arrangements for such products fully into line with relevant EU legislative requirements. In this context, the detailed examination of application dossiers from sponsoring companies is carried out by the Irish Medicines Board who recommend to me, as competent authority, on the grant or otherwise of a licence and on the conditions to be attached to such licence, including the proposed designated route of supply. My decision, as com<Col N="735" /> petent authority, accordingly takes full account of, but is not necessarily bound by, the recommendation from the IMB and as regards route of supply, as well as all other aspects, is based on the particulars of each case.</P>

      <P>On 7 October I announced that the Egyptian Authorities had that day published a decree to extend the existing European wide ban, but in a major development the decree provided for an exemption for countries with BSE controls of the type operated by Ireland. This represented a major breakthrough which prepared the way for the long awaited re-opening of the Egyptian market for Irish beef. Since then, all details requested by the Egyptian authorities have been provided and Egypt has now formally listed Ireland as a country which meets the required criteria for beef imports into Egypt.</P>
      <P>The question now of competing for contracts is a commercial matter for the exporters involved and it is not possible at this stage to say what volumes will be exported in 2001. I am, naturally, hopeful that Irish companies will compete to regain the level of market share they enjoyed in recent years in this important market.</P>

      <P>Under the 2001 suckler cow premium schemes, applicants were required to submit cattle identity cards-passports for the animals on which they were applying for premium. During the 2001 scheme year, my Department operated a green card exchange programme whereby the old style cattle identity cards submitted with the applications were then forwarded to the South-Western Services Co-operative Society Limited &ndash; SWS &ndash; where they were replaced by the new style animal passports.</P>
      <P>The breed of one of the animals for which a cattle identity card was forwarded on behalf of the person named had originally been recorded as a Friesian cow and, while the cattle identity card had been subsequently amended to reflect the beef breed of the cow, the new passport reflected the original, Friesian, breed. Therefore, when the 2001 suckler cow premium application submitted by the person named was cross-checked against my Department's cattle movement monitoring system, the animal was identified as being of non-beef breed and thus not eligible for suckler cow premium. The person named was advised by my Department to have the animal passport amended to reflect the beef breed. As this passport has now been amended, payment is expected to issue to the person named within the next 14 days.</P>

      <P>BSE legislation provides that farmers are compensated at current market value rates for animals that have been depopulated as a result of BSE. The compensation is paid to enable farmers to restock. Repopulation of the farm is normally permitted 30 days after satisfactory completion of cleansing disinfection so the farmer need not be out of business for a prolonged period of time. There is no provision for payment of other compensation in respect of BSE depopulations.</P>

      <P>Under the milk quota restructuring scheme, new and recent entrants to dairying are among the priority categories for the allocation of quota. A new entrant, who previously had no quota and acquired quota under a restructuring scheme, must have a separate herd number and must operate a separate holding incorporating milking and storage facilities. There are provisions under milk quota regulations whereby such quota can, under certain circumstances, be transferred to another holding acquired by the beneficiary. Application to do this should be made by the beneficiary under regulation 22 of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 2000, S.I. No. 94 of 2000).</P>

      <P>The position is that the minimum stocking density requirement for the area-based compensatory allowance scheme was agreed as part of the scheme in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of Ireland's CAP rural development plan. Under the terms and conditions of the 2001 disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance scheme an applicant, to be eligible for payment must: be a person aged 18 years or over and hold a herd number issued by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development; occupy and farm a minimum of three hectares of forage land in a disadvantaged area; reside within daily commuting distance, 70 miles, of the holding on which compensatory allowance is being claimed; undertake to remain in farming for five years from the first payment of compensatory allowance; comply with good farming practice as published by the Department in the CAP Rural Development Plan 2000-2006; comply with the EU Hormones Directives 96/22/EC and 96/23/EC; meet a minimum stocking level of 0.15 livestock units equivalent-forage hectare of the entire holding in 2000.</P>
      <P>This minimum stocking level will not apply where the rural environment protection scheme or other recognised environmental measures require a lower stocking density. However, farmers who are unable to meet the minimum stocking density but who qualified for headage grants in 2000 in respect of cattle and/or sheep may qualify for payment under the new scheme, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing. Livestock units &ndash; LUs &ndash; are calculated as follows: bovines over two years of age &ndash; one LU; Bovines two years old and under &ndash; 0.6 LU; Registered Breeding Mares registered in the Irish Horse Register or with the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society &ndash; one LU; Female Breeding Deer = 0.3 LU; Sheep and Goats = 0.15 LU. I am satisfied that there is no conflict between Duchas and my Department regarding this scheme. One hectare = 2.471 acres, for example, 0.15 LU-hectare is equal to 1 ewe-hectare or 2.471 acres.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive range of measures is in place for the control and eradication of the disease. This includes compulsory notification of the disease, the depopulation of the BSE herd and the birth cohorts and progeny of the infected animals, a ban on the use of meat and bonemeal for farmed animals and the removal and destruction of specified risk materials from ruminant animals. These measures have been strengthened by a programme of targeted active surveillance for BSE among fallen and casualty animals. In addition all cattle over thirty months of age entering the food chain are now being tested for BSE.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this range of measures is proving effective, and that it provides a sound basis for consumer confidence in beef, for the protection of public health and for the ultimate eradication of the disease from the national herd. I do not consider it appropriate to set a target date for the eradication of the disease in Ireland at this stage. However, I believe on the basis of the veterinary advice available to me, that the disease is reaching its peak. While I accept that there may be additional cases this year and next year, particularly in light of the additional surveillance under way, the age profile of cases being identified would indicate that the level of cases should begin to decline thereafter.</P>

      <P>Since 1 January 2001 almost £802 million has been paid to farmers under the various compensatory allowances, livestock premium and arable aid schemes of which some £480m is in respect of the 2001 schemes. This compares very favourably with payments in previous years and is in line with targets set out in the protocol on direct payments to farmers agreed with the farming organisations.</P>
      <P>The payment targets set out in the protocol are very specific and my Department has a good record in relation to their achievement and indeed has surpassed them on a number of occasions. Full payments under the 2001 disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance scheme commenced as agreed on 21 September and over £162.5 million has been paid to date. With regard to the 2001 cattle premium schemes, payments of 80% advances commenced on 26 October, the day the EU Regulation allowing advances of 80% to be paid instead of the usual 60% was published. Some £144.5 million issued to beef farmers on 26 October and to date a total of £183.7 million has been paid to them. Full payments under the 2001 arable aid scheme commenced on 16 November the date specified in the protocol and the earliest permitted by EU regulations. In excess of £94 million was paid to approximately 95% of applicants on that day.</P>
      <P>The only livestock payments that were not paid on target this year were the first advances under the 2001 ewe premium scheme. These were delayed because extra checks were necessary following the discovery of irregularities in ewe premium applications in the Cooley area of County Louth at the time of the foot and mouth crisis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Parliamentary Questions Nos. 92 to 94, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The ministerial declaration agreed at the WTO ministerial conference, while not prejudging the outcome, commits WTO members to negotiations in relation to agriculture aimed at substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support.</P>
      <P>It also provides that special and differential treatment for developing countries shall be an integral part of all elements of the negotiations and that non-trade concerns will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The draft declaration originally proposed referred to &ldquo;reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies&rdquo;. This phraseology would have predetermined the outcome of the negotiations and was unacceptable to me for that reason. Due to the insistence of two EU member states in particular, France and Ireland, and against strong opposition from other WTO members, the phrase &ldquo;while not prejudging the outcome of the negotiations&rdquo; was inserted in the final text.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the terms of the ministerial declaration are in accordance with the EU's negotiating mandate on agriculture which was agreed by the Council of Ministers. This represents a most successful outcome to the Doha Conference for the EU and for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new round of negotiations is scheduled to conclude by 2005. It would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome. However, in preparation for the future challenges and opportunities that may emerge for the Irish agriculture and food industries, I established in June 1999 a group to make recommendations on the development of those industries over the present decade. That group's report entitled Agri Food 2010 was completed in March 2000 and I approved and published a plan of action in August 2000 for the implementation of its recommendations. Substantial funding for many of the recommendations has been provided in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. I am confident, therefore, that the agriculture and food industries will be well prepared to cope with any increased competition on the domestic market and to exploit opportunities <Col N="744" /> on export markets and so maximise their contribution to Irish wealth and employment and the development of rural areas over the next ten years.</P>

      <P>Ireland continues to export the vast bulk of its milk products into the EU internal market and I do not envisage any change in this trend in the foreseeable future. The principal markets within the EU are the UK, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and France, while Belgium and Italy are also valuable markets for Irish products. On the international front Ireland has developed a range of valuable export markets, chief amongst these being in Asia and Latin America, with the US being the principal third country destination for casein and caseinates. With the expected continued growth in the world dairy trade, with dairy product consumption forecast to grow by 2% per annum between now and 2006, significant growth is expected in Asia, Latin America and possibly central and eastern Europe. The Irish dairy industry is well positioned to take advantage of this expected growth in the world dairy trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past year beef exports to continental EU and third country markets have been adversely affected by the BSE crisis in mainland Europe late last year. While no BSE related restrictions on Irish beef or beef products have been imposed by the EU Commission or by any individual member state of the EU loss of consumer confidence in beef has led to reduced beef consumption in mainland Europe. While exports to continental markets have fallen substantially over the past year, I am happy to say that that decline has been offset by increased beef exports to the UK. Exports to this market are running at about double last year's levels and the indications are that this level of trade will continue for the foreseeable future. Beef consumption in the EU as a whole is steadily recovering from the serious collapse which took place in late 2000. This is due to a restoration of confidence in the product as a result of measures taken at EU level. The market support measures <Col N="745" /> put in place to deal with the overhang of product on the market have had a useful effect in helping to restore balance. All of this will help Ireland's efforts to regain our former levels of sales to the markets in question.</P>
      <P>Efforts at political, diploma and technical level are continuing to secure the reopening of important third country markets, most of which were closed to us following the BSE crisis last year. The Russian market for Irish beef, which was closed following the FMD crisis re-opened earlier this year. My Department, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia has worked intensively to point out to the authorities in those markets the level and effectiveness of the controls in place in Ireland and to emphasise the guarantees in relation to food safety we can offer to consumers of Irish beef. Particular attention was given to Egypt, as our largest single market for beef exports and, as the Deputy will be aware, we have been successful in regaining access to this significantly important market. It is hoped that the re-opening of the Egyptian market will help towards the re-opening of other important markets in the region and elsewhere and efforts towards this end are continuing.</P>

      <P>Ireland imports an extensive range of meat and meat products from other member states of the EU and from third countries. In accordance with its trade obligations as a member of the European Union and the World Trade Organisation, Ireland is obliged to accept these imports, provided they comply with harmonised EU control measures governing veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable to intra community and third country trade, and, indeed, benefits from reciprocal arrangements. These measures constitute an essential control on the importation of animal products from third countries. In light of the recent serious animal disease outbreaks in the European Union, I believe that there is a need to re-examine these controls, and that the European Commission needs to re-focus its attention to some extent, on the potential threat to animal and human health from third country imports. I assure the Deputy that I have made my views on this issue clear to my European colleagues.</P>

      <P>Products of animal origin imported from other member states and from third countries must comply with certain standards of production as provided for under EU legislation in order to protect animal and public health. Before any such trading is permitted consideration is given by the European Commission to a number of factors which are the health status of the livestock, both domestic and wild, especially in regard to exotic diseases; the swiftness of the country to report the existence of infectious diseases; the country's preventative controls for animal diseases; the structure of the veterinary service and laboratory service; the country's control measures on prohibited substances; the premises of production meet EU requirements; and the product is certified in compliance with the relevant veterinary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to countries with particular incidences of animal diseases, such as BSE or foot and mouth disease, additional measures are taken by requiring specific veterinary certification in relation to the product with regard to its production and processing procedures. These measures are under constant review to ensure the continued protection of animal and public health. I have been pressing the Commission and the <Col N="747" /> Council to undertake a review of the import regime for foodstuffs and broaden control arrangements, particularly in regard to products being transported for personal consumption.</P>

      <P>Apart from a slight increase in 1999 venison production has remained at almost the same level over the past four years. The current position for deer farmers is positive and I am pleased to see that both demand and prices have shown significant improvement this year. We have had a good calving season in 2001 and good quality animals are going into fattening units.</P>
      <P>Deer are included this year under the area based compensatory allowance scheme and assistance for the housing and handling of deer is available under the regional operational programmes. Funding is also available under the REPS scheme. I am confident that these measures will boost the confidence of producers and encourage them to expand their units. This in turn will put the industry on a sound basis for expansion in 2002.</P>

One error now remains outstanding concerning an animal which the person named had incorrectly registered as a male animal on the national calf birth registration database. He has been advised by my Department to have the registration details amended to reflect the female status of the animal. In the meantime, his application will be processed for payment on the basis of 89 animals. Payment of the 80% advance will issue to him within the next 14 days.

    <P>Shared ownership loans from a local authority are treated no differently than any other loan in that, subject to the conditions and limits outlined above, an individual is entitled to claim income tax relief on any mortgage interest paid on such loans. I understand that under a shared ownership arrangement, an individual's monthly repayment comprises rent payable to the local authority and repayments of capital borrowed from the local authority together with mortgage interest thereon. While income tax relief is available in respect of the mortgage interest paid, there is no income tax relief due on the rental element of the monthly repayment.</P>
    <P>From 1 January 2002 income tax relief for mortgage interest will be given at source by the relevant lending agency &ndash; local authority, building society or bank &ndash; under the tax relief at source system. The relief will be built into the borrower's monthly mortgage repayments. In the case of shared ownership loans from local authorities, the borrower will receive full details directly from the local authority on how tax relief at source will be applied to his or her home loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr</NameTxt>
      <P>. <b>McCreevy): </b>The issue raised by the Deputy relates to the new scheme of administering tax relief in respect of qualifying mortgage interest &ndash; tax relief at source. The Deputy should be aware that this policy change was in fact announced in last year's budget. The essence of this scheme is that from 1 January next, tax relief on qualifying mortgage interest will no longer be administered through the tax system but will instead be given at source <Col N="750" /> by the mortgage lenders. This means that the tax relief element will be given to the borrower at the time the payment is made to the mortgage lender and will result in a lower mortgage payment at source.</P>
      <P>The change to tax relief at source was made with a view to putting in place a much simpler and more efficient method of administering tax relief on mortgage interest. Any adjustment in interest rates as well as any change in the amount of interest payable as the mortgage matures will be immediately reflected in the amount of tax relief given. In addition it will also extend for the first time tax relief on mortgage interest to those whose income is too low to avail of the relief under the current system.</P>
      <P>While the lending institutions will administer tax relief on mortgage interest from 1 January, 2002, there are no plans for the Revenue Commissioners to pay fees to the institutions in relation to the operation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act 2001, section 23(5)(f2&gt;a)(iv), makes provision for the transmission by the Revenue Commissioners of certain information to the lenders, that is necessary for the operation of the scheme. I am satisfied that the provision of this information is not in breach of privacy.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Public Service Pensions, which reported recently, considered the question of persons entering the public service in this country who had previously served in the UK public service. The Commission recommended that the rel<Col N="751" /> evant authorities here take up with the relevant authorities in the UK the question of amending the respective transfer schemes so as to enable individuals who have built up pension entitlements in the public service in one jurisdiction to have the benefit of those entitlements transferred to the other jurisdiction and given appropriate credit for the purposes of the pension scheme applicable in the other jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The commission recognised that any such arrangements could only be made where there was an agreement to operate them on a reciprocal basis and that the arrangements would have to reflect the overall parameters of the schemes. The commission noted that, in practice, it was likely that any such changes would only apply in relation to future transfers and that the service credit would be the actuarial equivalent of the accrued entitlements.</P>
      <P>I announced on 28 September, 2001 that the Government had decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and that it intended to establish the working group to advise on implementation as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The Government will agree the operational details of the implementation of the Commission recommendations following receipt of a report from the implementation working group.</P>
      <P>In relation to teaching service, a working group reporting to the North-South ministerial council, with representatives from the Department of Education and Science, the Northern Ireland Department of Education and my Department, is examining the question of the mutual recognition of teaching service for pension purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of speech and language therapy services in counties Louth and Meath is a matter in the first instance for the North-Eastern Health Board. The Board has informed me that due to the general shortage of speech and language therapists it is experiencing difficulties in filling vacant posts. Amongst the measures which the board is taking to fill vacancies are international advertisement and the sponsorship of students. A second dedicated speech and language therapist post was sanctioned this year for the early intervention services in Louth which will also be advertised internationally. When these posts are filled pre-school children with Down's syndrome will receive services from multi-disciplinary teams.</P>
      <P>In County Louth, speech and language therapy services for children with Down's syndrome are provided through the disability services. However due to the long-term need of these individuals, a number of children also receive services from the generic speech and language therapy service.</P>
      <P>Children in the 0-6 age group come within the remit of the early intervention service, which currently has a vacancy in this area. An additional post provides services to schoolgoing children in special schools in Dundalk and Drogheda and in mainstream schools throughout Louth and south Monaghan.</P>
      <P>Currently all referrals in the Louth-South Monaghan area are screened within three months of referral and are then waitlisted. In the interim, where it is appropriate and if they are wish to participate, parents may be offered places on an intensive parent training course or a home programme. All clients are seen by whichever therapist can take them when the client reaches the top of the waiting list. As children with Down's syndrome are generally waitlisted at birth, this currently means that in most cases they begin to access therapy services between 18-26 months of age.</P>
      <P>Children with Down's syndrome in County Meath receive speech and language therapy services in a variety of settings, including St. Mary's Special School and through community clinics. While there are waiting lists in the community services, the Speech and Language Therapy Department does try to prioritise children with Down's syndrome.</P>
      <P>The early intervention services for children from 0-6 years are currently being developed in the board's region. This involves the establishment of dedicated multi-disciplinary teams which will provide the appropriate services to children with developmental delay. The board, in partnership with Enable Ireland, has commenced this service in south-west Meath. A second multi-disciplinary team will be established in the north of the county early in 2002. Children with Down's syndrome from 0-6 years will therefore receive speech and language therapy within the context of the developing early intervention services.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a specific commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland. An expert consultative group established to advise my Department on the development of the programme submitted its report in recent weeks. The report is being considered and will be dealt with as a priority. The Mater Hospital, Dublin, has been designated as the surgical site for the pro<Col N="756" /> gramme. The provision of a transplant unit forms part of a major capital development at the Mater Hospital under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>I am committed to ensuring that the Irish programme, when introduced, will be in a position to match the highest international standards in lung and heart and lung transplantation.

      <P>The provision of health related services, including personal assistance services, to people with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Additional funding allocated to the health boards for the development of such services will be in the context of the total amount of funding allocated for the development of services in the physical and sensory disability sector. Other priorities for service developments in the sector will also be taken into consideration when allocating this funding.</P>
      <P>Since it came into office in 1997 the Government has allocated just over £107 million or 135.86 million for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This year I allocated an additional £12 million or 15.237 million, rising to £24 million or 30.474 million in the year 2002, for the development of those services. I decided that of this, £5 million or 6.349 million, rising to £10 million or 12.697 million in the year 2002, will be targeted at home supports, including £2.5 million or 3.174 million, with a full year cost of £6 million or 7.618 million, for personal assistance services. This means that in 2001-02, funding is being provided for an additional 312 personal assistants to provide a service to approximately 230 clients. Including the £10.5 million or 13.332 million already invested in these services since 1997, a total of £20.5 million or 26.03 million in on-going funding is being made available for home support services, including personal assistance services. I wish to assure the Deputy that providing the relevant support services to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible will remain one of my priorities.</P>

      <P>Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, was introduced by way of Circular 24/73 and is administered by the health boards on my behalf. DCA is paid in respect of children under 16 years who are severely physically or mentally disabled and who require constant care and supervision at home substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age. The current rate payment is £129.40, 164.30, per month, effective from 1 April 2001.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the following changes to the DCA scheme were announced in the budget on 6 December 2000 and came into effect from 1 April 2001; the introduction of a <i>pro rata</i> payment in respect of periods spent at home, e.g., weekends and holidays, by eligible children who normally reside in special schools or institutions; and the abolition of the DCA requirement that the disability must have been present for six months prior to the date of application. From 1 April 2001 children may become eligible from birth. The allowance is now payable with effect from the date of application. Responsibility for the assessment of entitlement to and payment of the domiciliary care allowance in any individual case rests with the South-Eastern Health Board. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive officer to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply directly to him.</P>

      <P>Under planning legislation each planning authority is obliged to prepare a development plan setting out an overall strategy for the planning and development of its area. Such plans would include the policy of the authority in relation to the provision of one-off single houses. Decisions on individual applications are also a matter for each authority in accordance with its development plan or for An Bord Pleanála in the case of an appeal.</P>
      <P>As regards single houses in rural areas, it is essential that the farming community and those working on the land should be able to live in the country. However, a continuation of the current trends in one-off housing, particularly with regard to urban-generated development, i.e., development for those working in urban areas, will have significant implications in terms of a range of issues such as transport, the possibilities for strengthening many of our towns and villages, landscape and tourism and protection of ground and surface waters. All off these issues will be further considered in the context of the National Spatial Strategy now being finalised. The report, Sustainable Development: A Strategy for Ireland, published in 1997, indicated that in general there should be a presumption against urban-generated, one-off rural housing adjacent to towns.</P>

      <P>The disabled persons grant scheme is administered by local authorities in accordance with the legal framework established in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, and statutory regulations made under the Act. The framework laid down in the statutory regulations is, as far as practicable, designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities in administering the scheme.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing the scheme do not require local authorities to obtain an occupational therapist's report. Where authorities require such reports it is generally to ensure that the most appropriate works are carried out to meet the needs of the applicant and that the potential long-term needs of the applicant are addressed having regard to their disability. It is also a matter for the authority to ensure that there are no undue delays in the processing of applications for disabled persons grants.</P>
      <P>I continue to urge local authorities to operate the scheme in a flexible and responsive manner having regard to the needs of applicants. Local authorities should have regard to the availability of occupational therapists and any likely delay in determining whether an occupational therapist's report should be sought in any particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the practice of &ldquo;integration&rdquo; whereby occupational pension schemes take the State old age (contributory)-retirement pension into account in designing the overall benefit promise being made by the scheme. I should point out that by operating integration, an employer may be able to provide a retired person with an earnings-related pension which might otherwise not be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress that in considering any issue relating to occupational pension schemes, one has to take into account that such schemes are voluntary arrangements between an employer and employees. However, where such occupational schemes exist, I consider they should operate on <Col N="764" /> a sound basis from the perspective of the pensioner and I have made it quite clear since I became Minister that I expect the significant increases in the old age pension which have been introduced by this Government to be passed on in full to pensioners.</P>
    <P>I have expressed concern on a number of occasions in the House regarding the less favourable aspects of integration. Accordingly, in the 1999 Social Welfare Act, I provided for a prohibition on the practice of reducing occupational pensions already in payment, as a result of increases in the social welfare pension.</P>
    <P>The effect of this measure is to prohibit occupational pensions in payment from being reduced in any one year from the level obtaining in the preceding year. Such a prohibition was recommended by the pensions board in its report on the national pensions policy initiative, NPPI.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has evidence that this amendment is being flouted, I would be happy to have it investigated if I am provided with the details. Furthermore, while there is little, if any, evidence that any pension scheme rules permit an actual reduction in the amount of occupational pension in payment as a result of increases in the social welfare pension, this provision will act as a preventive measure to ensure that such a rule is not, in future, introduced in a pensions scheme.</P>
    <P>While integration is generally carried out on a once-off basis at the point of retirement, in a very small number of pension schemes integration continued on an ongoing basis after retirement under a total pension income approach, which was provided for in the rules of these schemes. Therefore I brought forward an amendment in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, to prohibit this practice. I believe that these measures clearly signal my concerns on this issue and ensure that social welfare increases are passed on in full.</P>
    <P>Another way of ensuring greater consistency across pension schemes in this area would be through indexation of pensions in payment and I set out proposals in this area in the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2001, which is currently before the Seanad. The Bill proposes, for schemes that do not provide indexation, that there be a mandatory review by the trustees of the scheme of the possibility of indexing pensions in payment at the lower of the increase in consumer prices, CPI, or 4%. The outcome of this review and the employers response, where required by the rules of the scheme, must be published in the annual report.  </P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed carer's allowance in respect of her husband who is in receipt of invalidity pension, which includes an increase in respect of her. The application was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that her husband was not in need of full-<Col N="766" /> time care and attention as required by legislation. Her appeal to the social welfare appeals office, along with subsequent medical evidence submitted, were considered by an appeals officer who decided that an oral hearing should be held. The number of appeals requiring oral hearing meant it was not possible to arrange a hearing before now. I have been advised that this hearing will be arranged when next an appeals officer is in the locality.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers.

The social welfare appeals system is quasi-judicial and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration. There is an inevitable time lag in a process governed by statutory and fair procedure requirements. The number of appeals has increased in recent years and average processing times have been broadly maintained during the last four years. While processing times in the social welfare appeals office compare favourably with international experience in this area, the achievement of improvements in processing times is a major objective of the office and the matter is kept under review.</P>

      <P>Part 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, which came into effect on 26 May 1999 provides in section 4 for the creation of a new offence, related to the possession of drugs with a value of £10,000 or more for the purpose of sale or supply, punishable by up to life imprisonment. Section 5 of the Bill provides that the court shall, in imposing sentence, specify a minimum period of imprisonment to be served of not less than ten years upon conviction for the offence. Section 5 also provides, however, that a court is entitled to depart from the imposition of the minimum sentence where there are exceptional and specific circumstances relating to the offence or the person convicted of the offence which would make it unjust to impose the minimum ten-year sentence.</P>
      <P>Factors to which the court may have regard include whether the person pleaded guilty, and, if so, the stage at which the person indicated the intention to plead guilty and the circumstances in which the indication was given and whether the person materially assisted the investigation of the offence. The information available to me at this stage suggests that the provision has resulted in a significant number of drug traffickers pleading guilty to serious drug trafficking offences and in the imposition of substantial sentences for such offences including the imposition of the minimum mandatory sentence of at least ten years in a number of cases. In view of the particularly serious nature of drug trafficking, I have commissioned a study into convictions for the new drug trafficking offence created by section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preliminary indications from the study suggest that the main factors taken into account by the courts in situations where a sentence of less than <Col N="770" /> ten years has been imposed are where the accused pleads guilty to the offence, co-operates with the prosecuting authorities and materially assists the Garda Síochána with its investigations. While I am therefore satisfied that the provisions have had a beneficial effect, I am nevertheless examining the provisions in the context of forthcoming criminal justice legislation with a view, if such is necessary, to further strengthening the law in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to say that a total of 46,800 age cards have been issued as of 27 November 2001. In relation to the promotion of age cards, I officially launched the age card scheme awareness campaign in Dublin Castle on 6 September 2000 in conjunction with the Garda authorities. All relevant bodies in the drinks industry were invited to the launch and attended it.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following steps have also been taken to promote the use of the age card. All Garda stations have been notified of the age card scheme and issued with application forms and posters. Non-Garda outlets have also been issued with application forms and posters; an age card poster campaign was initiated to target all pubs, off-licences, night clubs and dance halls etc. in each Garda district; each Garda district has held or will hold a local age card awareness campaign through use of all local media, such as radio and newspapers; co-operation and integration with the Department of Health and Children through the responsible serving of alcohol programme; contact is maintained with all relevant bodies in the drinks industry who continue to advise their members of any new development; youth information centres or youth groups nationwide have been issued with information leaflets, posters and relevant contact numbers; garda juvenile liaison officers and community gardaí visit post-primary schools, youth clubs, special projects etc. to highlight the age card scheme; future provision of the age card in Irish as well as in English; advertising the age card scheme in all schools and third level colleges; advertising the age card scheme on the back of till receipts in all main supermarkets, Tesco, Dunnes Stores, Superquinn, Supervalu and Centra, in December and exploring all possible avenues of advertising the existence of the age card scheme with a view to ensuring that young people get the message about the illegal consumption of alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to say that the high level interdepartmental working group established to agree <Col N="771" /> a co-ordinated response to recommendations contained in the interim report on off-licensing concluded that the age card scheme was seen as operating successfully, but that efforts to promote awareness and usage of age cards should be intensified. I am keeping the scheme under continual review and in that context I have established a review group within my Department to examine, in consultation with the Garda authorities, the current age card scheme and to make appropriate recommendations. I expect this group to report to me by the end of the year. In the meantime, I have no plans to abolish the existing fee and the Garda authorities will continue to promote the existing scheme.</P>
    <P>However, it must be borne in mind that while legislative measures, together with initiatives such as the voluntary age card scheme, can help to curtail the problem of under age drinking, they cannot be viewed as the only solution. Dealing with the demand side of the under age drinking problem should not be seen as the province of the State agencies alone. The drinks industry, the creative media and in particular parents, must also play a part in helping to address that side of the problem.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that it has not been possible, in the time available, to determine with any precision when the counting rule referred to by the Deputy, which is currently known as the primary offence rule, was adopted. I am, however, also informed that the rule, which is used by approximately half of the countries in Europe, has been in use in Ireland for many years. Internal Garda instructions in June 1965, for example, suggest that a similar counting rule to the primary offence rule was the methodology employed for recording crime at that time.</P>

      <P>The product 1H Tetrazole is classified by the United Nations as an explosive. This classification is accepted both here and in the United Kingdom and as such must be imported, transported and stored in this State as an explosive material for safety reasons. It is not open to me, therefore, to reclassify this material as non-explosive. Security requirements for the transport of explosive material are a matter for the Garda authorities.

      <P>My Department, as provided in its statement of strategy, has responsibility for formulation, development and evaluation of policy for the tourism sector as regards training, human resource policy, tourism marketing and promotion, tourism structures, tourism product development and North-South co-operation in tourism matters. Implementation of these policies and responsibility for day-to-day operational matters is a matter for the tourism agencies under the aegis of my Department &ndash; Bord Fáilte, CERT, Shannon Development and Tourism Ireland Ltd.</P>
      <P>Exchequer funding for tourism is provided under subheads B1-B9 of Vote 35, Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Details of these sub-heads are published annually by the Department of Finance in the Book of Estimates. They have recently published the abridged version for 2002. </P>
      <P>Over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, some 444 million, £350 million, will be spent on tourism programmes. This NDP funding will be spent on three themes &ndash; tourism marketing, tourism training and tourism product &ndash; over four operational programmes of the national development plan. The productive sector operational programme provides for 190 million &ndash; £150 million &ndash; for the tourism marketing fund. Tourism Ireland Ltd. and Bord Fáilte are the implementing agencies for tourism marketing.</P>
      <P>The employment and human resources operational programme provides for 127 million &ndash; £100 million &ndash; for tourism training. This operational programme has three tourism training measures &ndash; sectoral entry training &ndash; school leavers; sectoral entry training &ndash; unemployed persons and ongoing sectoral training &ndash; industry employees. CERT is the relevant implementing agency for tourism training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Border, Midlands, West and South and East Regional Operational Programmes provide for 127 million, £100 million, investment in tourism product <i>via</i> the tourism product investment scheme.

Bord Fáilte is the relevant implementing agency for the scheme. I have no responsibility for the direct provision of hotel or restaurant facilities.

      <P>There are five special schools for young offenders under the aegis of my Department. They are Trinity House, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin, Oberstown Boys Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin, Oberstown Girls Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin, Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre, Kildonan Road, Finglas West, Dublin 11, and St. Joseph's Special School, Ferryhouse, Clonmel, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that the highest standards of care and child protection are provided for the young people in the care of these schools and that any complaints are investigated thoroughly by the relevant statutory authorities.</P>
      <P>Each of the schools has formal procedures in place to investigate any such complaints. A senior management member is appointed in each school to serve as the designated child protection officer to ensure that all complaints are fully investigated and passed on to the relevant statutory bodies such as the Garda and-or health authorities for formal investigation where required. The procedures do not involve reporting individual complaints to my Department. That said, where my Department becomes aware of allegations of abuse the matter is brought immediately to the attention of the management authorities who are directed to invoke the procedures as set down.</P>
      <P>As an additional safeguard to enhance the levels of child protection, my Department is currently developing formal standards governing the operation of these schools. The introduction of these standards will be followed by a system of independent inspection of each of the schools concerned. Independent inspection will provide further assurance concerning the complaints systems procedures being followed and help to identify any weaknesses and deficiencies that may exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of compensation proposed in the Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001, would not include young people under the age of 18 who have been victims of abuse in the juvenile centres. The scheme is intended for people for whom the normal legal processes present very significant and, in many cases, insurmountable obstacles. Not least among these obstacles is the passage of <Col N="775" /> time since abuse allegedly occurred, the difficulty this poses for establishing any facts of alleged abuse and the application of the Statutes of Limitation. These obstacles do not apply in the case of a young person. As the law stands at present their parents may sue on their behalf in respect of injuries received if they have suffered abuse in an institution. Alternatively the young person himself or herself may sue for damages on reaching the age of 18.</P>

      <P>Youthreach is a second chance education programme for young people aged between 15 and 20, who left school early without qualifications, that is, with less than five grade D's in the junior certificate. Training allowances are paid to participants depending on age, as follows: aged 15 to 16 years, £34.80 per week &ndash; 44.19; aged 17, £43.50 per week &ndash; 55.23 and aged 18 and over £85.50 per week &ndash; 108.56.</P>
      <P>The rate of £85.50 per week &ndash; 108.56 &ndash; for Youthreach trainees aged 18 and over is equivalent to the maximum unemployment payment under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for an adult. The rates of Youthreach training allowances are also co-ordinated with the relevant FÁS training allowances. It is expected that any future increase in Youthreach training allowances will be approved in accordance with general periodic improvements applicable to State-aided education and training programmes.

      <P>My Department provides examination papers in both Irish and English only. It is not feasible to provide customised question papers on an individual candidate basis having regard to the particular mother tongue.

      <P>However, if the Deputy has concerns about the presentational difficulties encountered by some students with regard to the submission of examination work, my Department instructs all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner.

However, in the event of the examiner encountering difficulty, he or she is instructed to send the answer book to his or her supervising examiner.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on early childhood education, Ready to Learn, sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood services for all children and emphasised the particular importance of early educational intervention in the case of children with certain special needs. Following its publication, my Department undertook an extensive post-consultation process with all those who made presentations to the National Forum for Early Childhood Education. The aim of these consultations was to seek the views of interested parties with regard to the phased implementation of the policies set out in the White Paper and to enable the necessary planning and preparatory work for the implementation to be undertaken by my Department in line with the commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>More recently, my Department sought and received detailed proposals from specific third level institutions on the implementation of the main proposals in the White Paper. I am pleased to say that I have recently appointed St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, and the Dublin Institute of Technology, both of which have considerable expertise in the area, to undertake a major project to develop and support the provision of quality early childhood education in pursuit of the objectives of the White Paper. The project, which will run for up to three years, will involve the establishment of a centre for early childhood development and education, which will be managed jointly by the two institutions and staffed by a suitably qualified professional team. The centre will develop quality standards in relation to the wide range of issues affecting early childhood education, including equipment and materials, staff qualifications and training, teaching and learning methodologies, curriculum, guidance for parents and related areas. It will also design and pilot measures to encourage compliance with those quality standards by early education providers.</P>
      <P>A key function of the centre will be to examine and develop forms of early intervention and support for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and children with disabilities, building on the experience of existing programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the centre will be undertaken in close consultation with my Department and the various agencies, advisory bodies and providers <Col N="779" /> in the sector. Funding for the project will be met from the £74 million allocation provided by the Government under the national development plan for the implementation of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>My Department has no record of the individual cases referred to by the Deputy. My officials will be pleased to investigate the matter should the Deputy wish to provide further details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The funding arrangements for our post primary schools have evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and reflect the sectoral division of our second level sector. At the core of funding arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. There are, however, differences in the approaches to the funding of back-up services, such as insurance arrangements, secretaries and caretakers.</P>
      <P>The Blackstock report on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post-primary schools. The recommendations made in the Blackstock report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels.</P>
      <P>Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, and I am committed to bringing greater equity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already shown my commitment in this regard by my recent announcement of further major increases in the school services support fund. This increased funding will enable me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. With immediate effect, the annual support grant will be increased from £20 &ndash; 25.40 &ndash; per pupil to £50 &ndash; 63.49 &ndash; per pupil, with a further increase to £70 &ndash; 88.88 &ndash; per pupil next September, and to £78 &ndash; 99.04 &ndash; per pupil in January 2003. The minimum annual grant for smaller schools will also be increased from £4,000 &ndash; 5,078.96 &ndash; to £15,600 &ndash; 19,807.91 &ndash; while that for schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000 &ndash; 12,697.38 to £39,000 &ndash; 49,519.79 &ndash; over this school year and the next. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, <Col N="781" /> is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
    <P>In addition, schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard <i>per capita </i>grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and by £10 from September this year. The grant will be further increased by the significant sum of £7.88 &ndash; 10 &ndash; for the next school year that will bring the grant to £209.88 &ndash; 266.47. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £16,440 &ndash; 20,874.49 <i>per annum</i>, and a total capitation grant of £104,940 &ndash; 133,246.31 &ndash; towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 &ndash; 38.09 &ndash; per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £119,940 &ndash; 152,292.39.</P>
    <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools and to addressing the issue of equity in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, which is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of Our Lady of Mercy primary school is a principal and nine mainstream class teachers, which is based on an enrolment of 269 pupils on 30 September 2000. This is one mainstream class teacher less than the school had for the 2000-01 school year. The school also has a resource teacher for Travellers, a shared-based learning support teacher and a resource teacher for special needs children. The board of management of the school has advised my Department that the enrolment on 30 September 2001 was 270 pupils.</P>
      <P>The only deviation from the agreed staffing arrangements is in the case of developing schools. The increase in enrolment between 30 September 2000 and 30 September 2001 of one pupil does not satisfy the criteria for the allocation of an additional post for the 2001-02 school year.</P>

      <P>Section 40 of the Universities Act, 1997 enables a university to determine and charge fees for student registration, courses, lectures, examinations and other services. Similarly section 17 of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992 and section 18 of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992 allow an Institute of Technology to <Col N="783" /> make similar charges subject to such conditions as may be specified by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses. In the case of approved certificate and diploma courses in the institutes of technology, eligible students can have their tuition fees met under the third level trainee scheme. In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge was levied by third level colleges in the 1995/96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge is £312 for the 2001-02 academic year. Students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge, as it is met by the relevant grant authority.</P>
      <P>Students pursuing approved part-time undergraduate courses are eligible for tax relief on their fees. Post-graduate students pursuing approved full-time courses may qualify to have their tuition fees paid under the student support schemes or alternatively can apply for tax relief.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the examination performance of males and females in Ireland mirrors international experience. I have recently commissioned an educational research project to address this matter in conjunction with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. This research was stimulated by the findings of the longitudinal study on the performance in the 1996 leaving certificate of the cohort of students who sat the junior certificate examination in 1994. This longitudinal study was conducted by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, for the NCCA. The study commented on the tendency for boys to be over-represented in the groups of students receiving low grades and under-represented in the groups achieving high grades.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Equality Committee in my Department, the Equality Studies Department in UCD has been engaged, since 1998, in a detailed two-phase quantitative analysis of performance of boys and girls in the junior certificate examinations &ndash; 1992-96 &ndash; in all subjects but with particular reference to mathematics. I await the outcomes of this study which should become available early in 2002.</P>
      <P>The Equality Committee in my Department is finalising proposals for another research project to be undertaken in co-operation with the NCCA. This study proposes to focus on the examination results of the 2001 certificate examination cohort with the purpose of analysing the achievements of boys and girls in the area of mathematics and comparing the performance of Irish candidates with that of their peers internationally. It is expected that the results of this analysis will be available by the end of 2002. Its findings will be evaluated in the context of further qualitative research in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NCCA is currently finalising a discussion paper entitled Developing Senior Cycle Education: Consultative Paper on Issues and Options. It is hoped to launch this paper early in 2002 and to promote extensive discussion on the senior cycle and also on the impact of current assess<Col N="785" /> ment arrangements on the performance of boys and girls in the leaving certificate examination.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses, 2001, grants may not be paid in respect of a second period of attendance at the same level for a course approved for the purposes of this scheme, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously. The vocational education committee will have discretion to waive this provision in exceptional circumstances such as certified serious illness. I understand that additional medical evidence was recently supplied by the candidate in question to officials at County Cork VEC. The case will be considered in light of the additional medical evidence.</P>
