      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Gilmore, Joe Higgins and Sargent. I propose to call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted notices to my office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31 I seek to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention: the implications for the authority of the Government and the credibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government of the decision by the Government to capitulate to pressure from four Independent Deputies by agreeing to remove a central provision of the Local Government Bill, which would have prohibited Deputies from also sitting on local authorities.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Under Standing Order 31 I seek to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the capitulation of the Government to four Independent Deputies causing the abandonment of what the Government previously stated to be a major plank of local government reform, that is, the prohibition on Members of the Dáil being members of local authorities, to allow the Government to clarify its policy on local government in light of the new situation and to clarify whether the Cabinet is in charge of proposed Government legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I request the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the absolute loss of credibility and lack of confidence enjoyed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government following his ditching of the so-called Government commitment to end the double jobbing dual mandate policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. b24, motion re referral to the Committees of Protocol relating to the Madrid agreement concerning the International Registration of Marks and Trade Marks (Madrid Protocol) Regulations, 2001 &ndash; Draft; No. 9, European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; and No. 48, Local Government Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. b24 shall be decided without debate, Second Stage of No. 9 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m., the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 48 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m., and questions shall be taken today from 3.30 p.m. until 4.45 p.m. In the event of a Private Notice Question being allowed, it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m. and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House is not in a position to accept any part of the Order of Business this morning because of the volte-face by the Government overnight in relation to the Local Government Bill. This is a major change in the Bill, given that it was referred to by the Minister as the cornerstone of it. Does the Tánaiste agree that this Bill should not be concluded today?</P>

      <P>We cannot agree to any part of the Order of Business today until we are clear about the Government's intention in relation to the Local Government Bill. We will not agree to anything proposed today. We cannot accept an Order of Business without knowing the Government's intention. Has a Government decision been made on the dual mandate aspect of the Local Government Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be reasonable before we vote on this matter for the Tánaiste to declare the Government's position? Has a Government decision been made about the Local Government Bill? We need to know that before we can make these decisions. Will the Tánaiste tell us the Government's view?</P>

      <P>The motion before the House deals with the conclusion of Second Stage of the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001. That is the only matter that can be raised at this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001, which is the issue before the House. Each day this week I asked the Taoiseach if he would agree to separate two issues that are incorporated in that Bill, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated some willingness to do recently. We must rectify the deficiencies in the Human Rights Commission Bill to allow the Human Rights Commission that we established under the Good Friday Agreement to function on a proper statutory basis, which it currently cannot do, and separately to deal with the bringing into force in this State of the European Convention on Human Rights, in a manner on which we can build consensus. The proposals contained in the current Bill have been opposed by a number of people, <Col N="284" /> including the President of the Human Rights Commission&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals in the Bill are not under discussion now, but only the arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday and the day before the Taoiseach, on the Order of Business, said he would communicate those views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and see if the two issues could be separated. From the Labour Party perspective, I offered to give full support to all Stages of the simple Bill to rectify the deficiencies in the Human Rights Commission. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, subsequent to the Order of Business yesterday, said that he would get a legal brief for me last night, but I have not yet received that.</P>
      <P>In the absence of the Taoiseach, will the Tánaiste please defer this matter and not divide the House on a matter of human rights. Let us give sufficient time without a guillotine to debate issues of fundamental importance, such as how the European Convention on Human Rights can be transposed into domestic law in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform considered what Deputy Howlin is suggesting but that it would not have been feasible to get the simple legislation through before the summer. It is encompassed in this Bill, it would not have been possible to get another Bill through in that short time. The Government is giving a commitment to an extended Committee Stage for this legislation which clearly is important.</P>

Individual maverick members of Fianna Fáil agree with the gang of four. However, notwithstanding that fact, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who is sponsoring this Bill, stated that it is a core part of his reform measures.

We need to know what, if anything, is left of the Government's reform of local government before we spend valuable time talking about something which has no basis in fact. That is a waste of the House's time. Does the Government propose to introduce a programme for unworkable local government to replace better local government, as that seems the only logical step?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday Mr. Justice Flood issued a communication to the Members of this House. The request laid before the House is of the utmost importance in ensuring public confidence in public administration. What is the attitude of the Government to that and will an amending order be brought before the House to accede to the request for additional members to add to the sole member of the Flood tribunal? When can we expect to see such proposals and will the Government consult opposition parties before making a final decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste confirm that the request by Mr. Justice Flood is unprecedented and, in the circumstances, that there should be consultation at the highest level between the parties on this matter? Can I take it the Government will be amenable to the request made by the distinguished judge? If so, when will an order be brought before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly the Government has not yet had the opportunity to discuss Mr. Justice Flood's letter but I can give the Deputy my opinion. We would be sympathetic to the request as we should be. Even if the judge gets the two extra members he requests in his correspondence to this House the tribunal will take two further years and if he does not it will take considerably longer.</P>
      <P>It is in everybody's interest, particularly in the public interest, that the tribunal be brought to an end as quickly as possible. It is doing very good work but the burden of it is such that two further members are required. As the House knows the two further members do not have to be judges. While we have always appointed judges as chairpersons of tribunals, given the pressures on the judiciary it may well be that the new members will come from elsewhere. It is important that we respond to the request in a sympathetic and favourable fashion and the matter should be discussed with the other parties in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Tánaiste rephrase her response to my initial question? I do not think <Col N="292" /> she meant to say the tribunal should be brought to an end as soon as possible. Rather it should be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. There are many who would like to bring it to an end but that might not be in the best interests of those who want to discover the full truth. In relation to the important answer she gave regarding additional members of the tribunal, it is likely this House will agree they need not necessarily be judges. The High Court could not spare two additional judges for that length of time. I ask that a commitment now be given to the House that, in considering any individual for membership of this tribunal, cross-party consultation would take place before a name is in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I meant a satisfactory conclusion and I was not suggesting that the tribunal be closed down. I thank the Deputy for drawing that to my attention in case there was any misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>It would be right that the parties in opposition be consulted about the new members to be appointed as it is this House that established the tribunal. It can be taken that will happen.</P>

      <P>On the question of promised legislation, the Taoiseach indicated yesterday that an instrument would be brought forward to create an agency to support women in crisis pregnancies. Is it intended to lay that before the House and, if so, will that be done before the recess? Yesterday we passed the Health Estimates and there was no provision in those for funding such an agency. Fine Gael will facilitate a Supplementary Estimate to properly fund such an agency if the Minister will bring that instrument forward as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste clarify two matters? First, regarding the amendment to the Local Government Bill, which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government proposes to bring to Government next Tuesday, will the Tánaiste clarify whether it is open to the Government not to accept that amendment? Second, can she clarify what we are to decide at 3.30 p.m.? Is the version of the Local Government Bill which will be decided upon at 3.30 p.m. the version of the Local Government Bill the Government intends to proceed with? Before 3.30 p.m. can we have the text of the amendment the Minister for the Environment and Local Government proposes to bring to Government next Tuesday? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be possible to have the text of the amendment the Minister intends to bring to Government before he brings that amendment to Government next Tuesday. Every Bill is amended in the House and frequently Government Ministers bring forward amendments to the House but that does not mean one withdraws the Bill on Second Stage. The Second Stage vote is a vote in principle on the broad thrust of the legislation while Committee Stage provides an opportunity to discuss all the details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose behind the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001, is to give effect in Irish law to certain provisions of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, more generally known as the Convention on Human Rights. The Bill also includes within its ambit the four main operative additional protocols to the convention which are still in force and which set <Col N="297" /> out rights supplementary to those in the convention itself. For ease of reference, the texts of all these instruments are scheduled to the Bill. The Bill also contains a provision to amend the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, so as to increase the number of members of the Human Rights Commission. This will allow the enlarged commission to be placed on a statutory footing immediately the Bill becomes law.</P>
      <P>As Deputies may already be aware, the proposals in this Bill and, indeed, those which led to the setting up of the Human Rights Commission can be traced directly back to the provisions in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement on Northern Ireland relating to rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity. I shall return to this aspect later in my contribution.</P>
      <P>The Convention on Human Rights was adopted by the Council of Europe in Rome and signed by the then Minister for External Affairs on 4 November 1950. Its provisions were later formally ratified by Ireland on 25 February 1953 and the convention entered into force for Ireland on 3 September that year. Ireland also accepted at that time the articles of the convention which permitted the right of petition by individual citizens and by states against states to the Court of Human Rights established by the convention to adjudicate on complaints of breaches of convention rights. It may be noted at this point that states generally were slow to take up this option and, at the time the convention entered into force, Ireland and Sweden were the only contracting states permitting such petitions. The United Kingdom, for example, only accepted the jurisdiction of the court in 1966 and France in 1981.</P>
      <P>In general terms, the convention protects what are universally accepted as the basic civil and political rights in any democratic state. They are the right to life; the right to freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; the right to freedom from slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour; the right to liberty and security of the person; the right to a fair and public trial within a reasonable time; the right to freedom from retrospective criminal law and no punishment without law; the right to respect for private and family life, home and correspondence; the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; the right to freedom of expression; the right to freedom of assembly and association; the right to marry and found a family; the right to an effective remedy for violations of rights as set out in the convention and the prohibition of discrimination in the enjoyment of those rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the additional protocols are concerned, the 1952 protocol deals with property, educational and electoral rights; the fourth protocol contains, among other things, the right to freedom of movement and also prohibits the individual or collective expulsion of nationals; the sixth protocol deals exclusively with the abolition of the death penalty and the seventh protocol, which <Col N="298" /> is in the process of formal ratification by the State, contains procedural safeguards concerning the expulsion of lawfully resident aliens, the right of appeal in criminal matters, compensation for wrongful conviction, the right not to be punished twice for the same offence and equality between spouses.</P>
    <P>In deciding to sign up to these international obligations, an important consideration was that we were comparatively very well placed to ensure that we would be able to meet our obligations under them. As a nation, we are fortunate in being one of the few states to have a formal written Bill of Rights enshrined in our 1937 Constitution. Indeed, it has to be acknowledged from the outset that Ireland is unique among the member states of the European Union, and among the other signatory states of the convention, in having a written Constitution which embodies a system of fundamental rights chosen by the people, which are unalterable save by the wish of the people, and which are made superior and justiciable at the instance of the individual over all other law, both in theory and in practice. Our excellent human rights record before the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg is due in no small measure to these factors.</P>
    <P>The hallmark of our protection of fundamental rights in the Constitution has been their development by the superior courts through the doctrine of un-enumerated personal rights largely by means of judicial review of legislation. The drawing up of international human rights texts by the United Nations and the Council of Europe has also influenced that process. It can be said that the United Nations Charter signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945 marked the emergence of international human rights awareness, in the aftermath of the atrocities committed during the Second World War. It was at this point in history that the need systematically to promote and protect human rights at the international level was fully recognised.</P>
    <P>The statement or bill of rights envisaged in the UN Charter was later adopted by the United Nations in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This in turn led to that organisation drawing up two international covenants in 1966 dealing with civil and political rights on the one hand, and economic, social and cultural rights on the other. Running in parallel with these developments, often mirroring them and frequently overlapping them, was the adoption by the Council of Europe of the Convention on Human Rights in 1950, some two years after the Universal Declaration and, at later stages, the various additional protocols to the convention adapting and extending its text and scope.</P>
    <P>An important consideration is the effective enforcement of international human rights standards is the relationship that exists in any given legal system between international law and domestic law. In some systems, for example, it is accepted that there is no real separation whatsoever between international law and domestic law. <Col N="299" /> Both are regarded as being parts of a unified system, and it may even be the case in some states under this monist theory that the international rules take precedence over national provisions. Other systems, however, which adopt the alternative dualist theory &ndash; and Ireland is a case in point &ndash; regard international law and domestic law as totally separate, so that international law is not necessarily part of domestic law, unless it is explicitly made so. What this means in practice is that rules embodied in an international instrument such as the Convention on Human Rights, cannot be enforced in our courts unless and until it is incorporated into our law by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>While the convention is law for Ireland, and is binding on it as an international treaty since 1953, its provisions do not actually apply directly in Ireland. That is because in keeping with the dualist theory that I have just mentioned, Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution reserves the sole and exclusive power of making laws to the Oireachtas alone, and Article 29.5.6 provides that no international agreement shall be part of the law of the State, save as may be determined by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This does not mean, however, that the convention is merely an academic source of rights. As I have said, Ireland was one of the first countries to allow its citizens the right of individual petition to the former Commission and Court of Human Rights to complain about alleged violations of civil and political liberties. The decisions of the Court of Human Rights in relation to any breaches of the convention's provisions by the State are binding, but under our constitutional scheme of things, it is the prerogative of the Government to decide precisely how any incompatible provision of national law or administrative practice may be reconciled with a ruling by the court. The introduction of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice and the amendments to the criminal law in the area of homosexual offences are just two examples where we took measures to comply with rulings of the court.</P>
    <P>It may also be said that although the convention is not part of Irish domestic law, and may not be viewed as a code of legal principles which are enforceable in our courts, regard may still be had to its provisions, particularly when a court is considering or interpreting the nature of a fundamental right which may be argued to exist under the Constitution. However, at the moment while the convention is law for the State on the international plane, it is not law in the State and if a person wishes to vindicate a right under the convention, they must first exhaust all possible domestic remedies which may be availed of under national law before going on to plead their case before theCourt of Human Rights in Strasbourg. In practice this means that the matter must be argued on the basis that the right already exists in the Constitution &ndash; which may or may not turn <Col N="300" /> out to be the position &ndash; and taken all the way to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill will alter that position fundamentally because it is designed to facilitate the bringing of cases involving alleged breaches of rights under the convention in Irish courts. In other words, it will make rights under the convention enforceable in Irish courts, and this means that cases of this type will be able to be processed much more expeditiously and with associated savings in legal costs and expenses, than under the present arrangements. The other advantage of the Bill is that Irish judges will be able to apply the benefit of the Strasbourg court's jurisprudence in the domestic situation and, in turn, their application of convention rules in the State will be capable of being considered by that court.</P>
    <P>That then is some of the background to the convention and its existing position within the Irish legal and constitutional framework. I would now like to move on to the reasons the Government has decided to propose that further effect should be given to the rights provisions of the convention in our domestic law or, as it is sometimes referred to, the process of incorporating the convention in the sense of amalgamating, combining or merging those provisions into our law.</P>
    <P>This whole matter was recently considered in depth by the Constitution Review Group in its 1996 report. In the specific context of the possible incorporation of the convention directly into the Constitution, and having carefully considered the merits and demerits of such a proposal, the group came to the conclusion that the convention should not be directly so incorporated on the grounds that there is already a very high degree of overlap between the Constitution's guarantees in the area of fundamental rights and the provisions of the convention. Furthermore, the group was of the opinion that this form of incorporation could very well lead to a diminution in some individual rights in the Constitution. They also believed incorporation in the Constitution would not have the effect of filling in any gaps in human rights protection, since every substantive right afforded by the Convention is either expressly protected by the Constitution, or has already been recognised as an unenumerated right by the Supreme Court under Article 40.3.1. The group also thought that incorporation might lead to new gaps in protection in fundamentally important areas, such as the right to trial by jury.</P>
    <P>Since the enactment of the Constitution in 1937, Irish courts have been working within a system of judicial review of legislation which confers on them far reaching powers. Under these statutory provisions statutory instruments and common law rules may be struck down as being repugnant to, or inconsistent with, the Constitution. It is against this background, almost unique in the common law jurisdictions, coupled with the fact that incorporation of the Convention by other States without written Bills of Rights, or lesser systems of constitutional protec<Col N="301" /> tion of human rights, have not been that effective or transparent, that the view was taken that it was preferable in our case to leave the Convention as a source of non-cognisable and non-justiciable rights in the strict sense.</P>
    <P>The Constitution Review Group pointed out that if the Constitution's method of recognising and protecting fundamental rights was advanced for its time, the experience since it was enacted showed that there were some flaws and there was a need for revision. The reasons which the group identified were that the list of rights protected by the Constitution is by contemporary standards incomplete. While the development of the unenumerated personal rights doctrine has proved in many respects to be beneficial, no real guidance is offered to the judiciary as to what these personal rights are. Another difficulty was that some rights are described in absolutist terms while others are highly qualified. The recommendation of the group was for ongoing reform of the Constitution to take account of modern human rights norms, based on its preliminary audit. However, it left the main task of identifying all of the precise areas where changes might be required to another body, suggesting that the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution might undertake the work.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the means by which the Convention could be given further and better effect in Irish law, the main issue to be decided was whether there were compelling reasons to depart from the status quo which had demonstrably served us well in achieving a delicate balance as between constitutional protection and its associated jurisprudence for over 60 years on the one hand, and the more specific provisions of the Convention as developed by the Court of Human Rights on the other. The need for such delicate balancing led to the whole matter being reconsidered in some detail, including the possibility of making the Convention effective at the legislative rather than the constitutional level. This was done on foot of the commitment by the Government in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement on Northern Ireland to bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights in the State, which would draw on the provisions of the Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Under the Agreement, any measures to be brought forward in this connection are to ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will ultimately pertain in Northern Ireland in the light of the ongoing developments on human rights there. It is relevant to the Government's examination of the matter that the United Kingdom had already decided, through the medium of the 1998 Human Rights Act, to give further and better effect to the Convention throughout its constituent jurisdictions, particularly in Northern Ireland, fully from 2 October 2000.</P>
    <P>In practical terms, two options were considered in detail by the Government in the matter. One <Col N="302" /> was simply to provide that the Convention should have the force of law in the State. This formula has already been followed in the case of some international Conventions like the Lugano Convention and the Hague Convention on Child Abduction. This solution might appear at first sight to be the neater for a State which already had a sophisticated approach to human rights protection at the constitutional and judicial levels. In fact, it was initially considered &ndash; as the anticipatory provision in section 11(3)(<i>b</i>) of the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, illustrates. On deeper analysis it became apparent that such an approach might have the capacity to interfere with one of the central pillars of the Constitution, namely the doctrine of the separation of powers.</P>
    <P>The other option was to avoid as much as possible any risk of possible interference with the legislative supremacy of the Oireachtas or the judicial supremacy of the Courts and to provide that, subject to the Constitution, statute law and rules of common law should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the State's obligations under the Convention. Statutory powers and the exercise of public law functions by State agencies should also be carried out in a manner which will conform with the Convention. Such an approach would be broadly similar to that adopted in the United Kingdom in the 1998 Human Rights Act, which seeks to avoid as far as possible any conflict with the doctrine of sovereignty of Parliament in much the same way as the Government wishes to avoid any conflict here with the authority of the Oireachtas. The Government opted for this latter form of interpretative incorporation as being the most appropriate. The provisions of the Bill are designed to ensure there will be two complementary systems in place in Ireland for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The superior rules under the Constitution will take precedence, in full harmony with the State's dual doctrine on giving effect to international obligations and the primary role of the Oireachtas in that regard.</P>
    <P>I will go through the principal features of the Bill in a general way. Section 1 provides for the definition of certain terms used in the Bill. These definitions, by listing the applicable Convention provisions and by detailing the organs of State to which the provisions will apply, are the yardsticks for the implementation of the Convention. This section provides that &ldquo;Convention provisions&rdquo; includes Articles 2 to 14 of the Convention and the four main operational protocols to the Convention as previously mentioned. Article 1 of the Convention is not included in this definition for the simple reason that, in conjunction with our signature and ratification of the Convention and our acceptance of the jurisdiction of the Court of Human Rights, the purpose of the Bill as a whole is to give further effect to the obligation in that Article on each contracting State to secure for everyone within its jurisdiction the rights and freedoms as set out in the Convention. I wish to highlight the fact that Article 13 of the Conven<Col N="303" /> tion, which deals with the right to an effective remedy for breaches of the rights under the Convention, is included within the definition. In this respect, we are going somewhat further than the UK which omitted this Article from the scope of its legislation.</P>
    <P>The section also provides for a definition of organ of the State. It includes tribunals or any other body &ndash; other than the President, the Oireachtas, either House of the Oireachtas, a committee of either House, a joint committee of the Houses or a court &ndash; which is established by law, or through which any of the legislative, executive or judicial powers of the State are exercised. The courts are excluded from the definition on the basis that they are already under a duty to administer justice in accordance with the law and the Constitution. The definition of organ of the State is drawn as widely as possible to ensure that the maximum number of organisations will be embraced by it.</P>
    <P>Section 2 establishes the framework through which further effect is to be given to the provisions of the Convention. This section provides that any statutory provision as widely defined in section 1 and any rule of law shall be interpreted, in so far as possible, in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the Convention. Section 3 imposes a positive obligation on organs of the State as they are defined in section 1, subject to any statutory provision or rule of law, to perform their functions in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the Convention. The section also establishes the first of two possible remedies provided under the Bill for alleged breaches of Convention rights.</P>
    <P>The first remedy arises where a person has suffered injury, loss or damage as a result of a breach by an organ of the State, then the person may, if no other remedy is available, institute proceedings in either the High Court or the Circuit Court to recover damages arising from such a loss. In proceedings before the Circuit Court the amount of damages payable is limited to the monetary jurisdictions of that court. While such proceedings must be brought within one year of the alleged breach, on the basis that such proceedings would have considerable importance for the administrative functions under attack, and it would be preferable, therefore, for any claims to be brought as expeditiously as possible, this limitation period may be extended at the discretion of the court where it considers it appropriate in the interests of justice.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 3 is to provide that damages will be awardable in a case where an organ of the State commits a breach of the convention, unless the body in question could not under the law of the State have acted differently. Where this is the case, it will be a matter for consideration as to whether the statutory provision or rule of law with which the organ of the State was complying could be found to be incompatible with the <Col N="304" /> convention under the provisions of section 5 which I will outline shortly.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides a statutory aid for the interpretation of the provisions of the convention and the relevant protocols thereto, to which further effect is being given in the Bill. This will allow the courts to examine the interpretation of the convention's provisions by the European Court of Human Rights, the former European Commission on Human Rights and the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, and to take their interpretations into account.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the second of the remedies under the Bill for alleged breaches of human rights. Where the High Court or Supreme Court, on appeal, decides in any case that it is not possible to interpret a statutory provision or rule of law in a way which is compatible with the convention and where there is no other legal remedy adequate and available, the court may, either on application by the injured party or of its own motion, make a declaration that the provision or rule of law is incompatible with the provisions of the convention. Such a declaration will not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the statutory provision or rule of law which may be found to be incompatible with the convention. This has to be the position because of the primary law making role assigned to the Oireachtas under the Constitution. It will then be a matter for the Government to consider what steps should be taken to remedy the particular incompatibility in question. This situation is similar to that which obtains when the Strasbourg court rules that a provision in Irish law contravenes the convention.</P>
    <P>Section 5 also requires that where a declaration of incompatibility is made, the Taoiseach is required to lay a copy of any order containing a declaration of incompatibility before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 days of the making of that order. The purpose of this provision is to provide a mechanism to ensure both Houses of the Oireachtas are notified as to the making by the court of a declaration of incompatibility.</P>
    <P>The Bill also creates a new compensatory scheme under section 5, whereby, following a declaration of incompatibility by the courts, the injured party may apply to the Government, through the Attorney General, for an <i>ex gratia</i> compensation payment in respect of any loss, injury or damage suffered as a result of the incompatibility. The reason any such payment would be made by the Government and not the courts is that the courts could not award damages where there is compliance with a statutory provision or rule of law which, while incompatible with the convention, remains constitutionally valid. In the absence of such a compensation scheme, the injured party seeking damages may be faced with the prospect of taking the case to Strasbourg, citing the State for failure to provide a full and effective remedy. Clearly such a state of affairs would be inconsistent with the principle underlying the Bill to give further effect to the <Col N="305" /> convention in national law by enabling cases to be taken and remedies obtained before national courts in respect of violations of the convention.</P>
    <P>In making such payments the Government may appoint a person to provide advice as to the quantum of damages, if this is going to be the case, to be paid to the injured party. Where the Government considers that it may be appropriate to make such payment, the provision is also made for the adviser, in advising the Government, to take account of the principles and practice of the Court of Human Rights in affording just satisfaction to an injured party under Article 41 of the convention.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is a technical mechanism providing for the Attorney General to be given notice of proceedings in which a court may make a declaration of incompatibility and provides that the Attorney General shall be entitled to appear in any such proceedings. The purpose of this provision is to ensure before a court makes its decision on such a fundamental matter the Attorney General can bring to its attention all constitutional and legal arguments which may be relevant to the issues before it. The Human Rights Commission, if it so wishes, will be able to apply to the court to be heard in the matter as <i>amicus curiae</i> under its existing function as listed in section 8(<i>h</i>) of the Human Rights Commission Act, 2001.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for technical amendments to the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, to take account of the increase in the membership of the commission from the nine commissioners specified in the Act to the 15 appointed by the Government. I shall say more about this matter.</P>
    <P>The section also provides for an amendment to section 11 of the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, to enable the commission to institute proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purposes of obtaining relief of a declaratory or other nature in respect of matters concerning the human rights of a person or persons under the Bill when enacted and in force as the European Convention on Human Rights Act, 2001. This amendment is required because the convention would not be embraced within the existing definition in the section as it is not a treaty being made part of the law of the State. The existing provision in subparagraph (<i>b</i>) is being retained as it may be relevant to certain areas of the commission's work and will enable the commission to take proceedings in the future if the Government of the day decides that any other human rights instrument is to be given force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>The Government is concerned to ensure, commensurate with the need for a full debate in the Oireachtas on the Bill's main provisions, the Human Rights Commission should be placed on a full statutory footing as soon as possible and definitely before the end of the present parliamentary session. I am aware the commission has been working in an interim capacity for some months and compliment its president and the other commissioners on the progress they have made so far. I indicated on a number of occasions <Col N="306" /> that I would take the first available legislative opportunity to place the enlarged commission on a statutory footing. This Bill is that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is a standard provision providing for the payment of any expenses arising under the Bill out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 9 provides that the Bill may be cited as the European Convention on Human Rights Act, 2001, and for a commencement period of six months.</P>
    <P>The idea that people have rights simply by virtue of their humanity is almost as old as humanity itself. It can be traced back through the political and legal theories of the natural law philosophers to the foundations of Roman law and, perhaps, even back to the philosophy of ancient Greece. In more modern times a dramatic shift of emphasis occurred in the crucial period leading up to the American and French revolutions which had the effect of moving these scholastic and theological theories into propositions which were intended to have the force of law.</P>

      <P>The framework proposed in the Bill acts as a bridge between the Constitution and the convention, thereby enabling future development of Irish case law to be informed by both instruments. The Bill also facilitates cross-fertilisation of ideas and jurisprudence and ensures the rights as enshrined in the Constitution are informed by international developments. It also affords an opportunity for our jurisprudence to influence the future evolution of human rights jurisprudence in Strasbourg and beyond. The provisions of the Bill will ensure there are two complementary systems in place in Ireland for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, with the superior rules under the Constitution taking precedence, in accordance with the State's dualist doctrine on the giving of effect to international obligations and the mutually exclusive roles of the Oireachtas and the Judiciary in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Bill presented to the House by the Minister is fundamentally defective and flawed. The Minister made reference to the Good Friday Agreement, on foot of which, in April 1998, the Government undertook to strengthen the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction and indicated that measures would be brought forward here which would, at least, be equivalent to the level of protection of human rights in Northern Ireland. A commitment was made to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law. Ireland is the last of the 41 signatory countries to the convention to incorporate it into domestic law. The UK legislation was enacted in 1998 and became fully operational throughout the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, on 2 October 2000.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been extraordinarily negligent in bringing forward the legislation to implement the commitment we made in the Good Friday Agreement. Unfortunately, the legislation as brought forward does not even measure up to the legislation passed by the United Kingdom Parliament.</P>
      <P>The Minister brought before the House legislation to provide for the establishment of our domestic human rights commission. This was the Act of last year. In an extraordinary act of political incompetence and sabotage, the Minister ignored the provisions in his legislation and chose to appoint to the commission a variety of individuals who did not feature among those recommended to the Minister for appointment by the committee established to suggest nominations. As a consequence, we have had for the past six months a commission on human rights unable to fulfil its statutory functions with the Minister proposing to nominate additional members to it way beyond the numbers permitted within his own legislation so that he can appoint to the commission many of those people whose names were previously recommended to him and which he ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue and problem should never have arisen in the first place. By way of an afterthought, the Minister now seeks in a section in the Bill to extend membership of the human rights commission to include the additional members he wishes to appoint to it having made a shambles of this issue in an extraordinary piece of political incompetence endorsed by the Government last December. If the Minister insisted on making additional appointments, there was nothing to stop him introducing a simple one-section Bill to amend the Act of last year and bringing it before the House in January or February last to have it enacted. It took the Minister until April of this year to publish the Bill with this provision included in it. He regards human rights as such a great priority that, having published the Bill in early April, we are only beginning the debate on Second Stage in a truncated and guillotined form. The manner in which our domestic human rights commission has been <Col N="308" /> treated by the Minister is a disgrace and is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister did not inform us whether the additional members whose names became public knowledge and who we understand he intends to appoint to the commission have all accepted his offer of appointment. That remains a matter of mystery and the House is entitled to know the answer to that.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with some of the specific issues which arise under the convention. As a matter of principle, the Fine Gael Party supports the incorporation of the human rights convention into Irish law. Our difference with the Government is the approach taken in the Bill which is minimalist and designed to ensure we do not go any further than the minimum distance required to allow the Minister to portray the Government as having lived up to its Good Friday obligations.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is a central provision in the Bill. Section 2(1) states:</P>
    <P>In interpreting and applying any statutory provision or rule of law, a court shall, in so far as is possible, subject to the rules of law relating to such interpretation and application, do so in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the Convention provisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained his approach to the Bill as being based on advice he has received concerning the issue of the separation of powers. The advice appears to be that courts should be allowed to make declarations that legislation is incompatible with the convention but should not of themselves be able to strike down statutory provisions which are incompatible with the convention. In effect, we will create a situation within the legal system where a court may make a declaration that a statutory provision is incompatible with the convention but, nevertheless, be required and compelled to apply that statutory provision to the resolution of a dispute between individuals in a case in which the incompatibility is pronounced and in future cases until such time as the legislation is changed. That type of approach will bring the courts system and the Judiciary into disrepute and will undermine the public credibility of the State's commitment to human rights as contained in the European convention.</P>
    <P>A fundamentally different approach should have been adopted which would have done no damage to the Constitution, would have copperfastened our respect for the European convention and would have ensured that, in so far as incompatibilities exist between the Constitution and the European convention, they would have been highlighted in a clear and coherent manner should they have arisen in the context of any litigation in the courts. The approach which should have been adopted as opposed to the approach contained in section 2 would be to provide that statutory provisions or rules of law should be amended to the extent that they violate provisions contained in the convention subject to the <Col N="309" /> overriding authority of the Constitution. That would have effectively meant a court which made a declaration that a statutory provision was incompatible with the Constitution would not have been obliged to enforce that statutory provision. That provision, by virtue of such decision, would have ceased to be applicable in future as a determining legal provision with regard to domestic legal disputes involving individuals or the State. The only proviso to it would be that the court, in making the decision on incompatibility, would have to be compliant with the constitutional provision.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that, if the courts were to override legislation, it would in some way violate the concept of separation of powers and the position of Members of the House as legislators. The reality is that courts regularly override statutory provisions where they are found to be unconstitutional. The House regularly enacts legislation which supersedes existing legislation. On occasion, Acts have been passed by the House with a broad section contained in them to the effect that, where there is a provision in existing legislation inconsistent with a provision in the Act, it is the later legislation which applies. A catch-all section of that nature has, on occasions, been inserted in legislation we have enacted. There is no reason this Bill should not have provided that the European convention and the rights under it take precedence over statutory provisions and that, if there is a court declaration of incompatibility, any statutory provision incompatible with the convention will cease to be enforceable, subject to the overriding rights individuals have under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Government, however, has sought to go a different route. It is my contention that it is the wrong route and that it is applying the wrong principles. What we are doing, which is extraordinary in the context of the number of the years the State has asserted its independence, is slavishly following the approach taken in the legislation enacted by the United Kingdom Parliament, except that, in some respects, that legislation, when it comes to declarations of incompatibility and ensuring compliance with the European convention, is broader than this legislation.</P>
    <P>In the Bill the courts are excluded from the organs of the State required to comply with the European convention. Why should they not be required to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights? The United Kingdom courts are required to do so. In other words, in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, the citizens of Northern Ireland have greater protection in their domestic law under the Human Rights Act, 1998, as passed by the Westminster Parliament than the citizens of this State will have under this measure.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Human Rights Act, 1998, are far broader in their application to public authorities. In the context of it being unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a convention right, section 6 of the <Col N="310" /> Human Rights Act, 1998, says the concept &ldquo;public authority&rdquo; includes first, a court or tribunal &ndash; our Bill includes a tribunal but excludes a court &ndash; and second, any person, certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature, but excluding the Houses of Parliament. All sorts of functions of a public nature undertaken by persons of legal identity will fall outside the provisions of this Bill as it is currently drafted. Again, the citizens of Northern Ireland will have greater protections than the citizens of this State. The Minister has not explained the reason for this.</P>
    <P>Section 3, which the Minister referred to as one of the sections under which a citizen of this State may obtain compensation for breach of the European Convention on Human Rights contains a provision which, again, slavishly follows the United Kingdom legislation. It provides that where there has been an acknowledged violation of convention rights in circumstances where the violation is not required by an existing statutory provision, an application for compensation can be made. Why can that application for compensation only be made within one year from the time when someone's rights are violated. There is a proviso that the period of one year in considering seeking compensation may be extended by order of the court, if the court considers it appropriate to do so in the interest of justice. However, on the basis of any basic civil action which can be brought, the statute of limitations currently prescribes a limit of three years in certain types of actions and a limit of six years in others. Where there is a violation of constitutional rights there is no limit at all. If there is to be a limitation period why should it not be three years? Why should someone whose rights are violated by an organ of the State in circumstances where that violation of rights was not required by statutory provision and who only discovers that his rights have been violated two years after the event, be excluded from seeking compensation? Why should such a person have to seek the special permission of the court to seek compensation and what principles would the court invoke in applying the concept of &ldquo;in the interest of justice&rdquo;? We do not know the answers to any of these questions. The one year period should be three years.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I contended that if we are serious about what we are doing our courts should not be required to apply statutory provisions to the outcome of litigation in circumstances where they are incompatible with the convention. In section 5 we are told:</P>
    <P>In any proceedings, the High Court, or the Supreme Court when exercising its appellate jurisdiction, may, having regard to the provisions of section 2, on application to it.where no other legal remedy is adequate. make a declaration.that a statutory provision or rule of law is incompatible with the State's obligations under the convention provisions.</P>
    <P>Why should a declaration of incompatibility be confined to the High Court or Supreme Court? <Col N="311" /> The Government has plans, in the Court and Court Officers Bill, to confer an enormous additional jurisdiction on the Circuit Court. The Bill will extend the jurisdiction of the District Court. The Minister should tell us what is the District or Circuit Court to do in litigation in which it is drawn to the attention of a District or Circuit Court Judge that making a decision might be incompatible with the convention?</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom legislation where litigation takes place in the courts, the courts are under a duty to consider whether the issue to be determined is relevant to the convention and whether issues concerning the convention should be brought into consideration. The courts have an independent duty to be aware of the provisions contained in the convention and are required to ensure that in administering justice, even if the lawyers representing individual litigants before the court or the litigants themselves do not refer to the convention, they do nothing which is contrary to the convention and the cases determined under it. Why is that provision excluded from this Bill? I do not understand why that is or why the citizens of Northern Ireland should have greater protection in that regard than the citizens of this State.</P>
    <P>In the context of what should happen following a declaration of incompatibility, the Government has included an extraordinary provision. If the courts make a declaration of incompatibility it means they have declared that someone's rights under the convention have been violated. However, the court which makes that declaration is not permitted to determine what compensation, if any, should be paid to the individual whose rights have been violated. It is interesting to note that the chairman of the Human Rights Commission, Mr. Justice Donal Barrington, a former Judge of the Supreme Court has dealt with this issue. Mr. Justice Barrington, addressing the provisions of the Bill at a recent conference, raised the question:</P>
    <P>Is it constitutional to have a decision where Parliament defines rights, the courts find that these rights are violated but cannot order compensation? This Bill needs a large measure of thought before it is passed by the Dáil. It is regrettable that we have adopted the British model of administrative option rather than legislative option.</P>
    <P>Not only have we adopted the British model of administrative option for dealing with the issue of compensation, the Minister is proposing a model which, of itself, violates the concept of separation of powers, further undermines the position of our courts in the constitution and seeks to confer on the Attorney General and the Government an adjudicating power in determining issues of compensation for violation of rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. We have now an Attorney General who wants to take to himself all sorts of powers which previous Attorneys General have not sought, who wants <Col N="312" /> to exercise a personal veto on who might in the future be appointed to the judiciary, regardless of what the commission which is supposed to vet the qualifications of those who seek judicial appointments recommends and who believes he should determine what compensation should be paid to those whose rights are violated under the convention.</P>
    <P>Section 5(4) says that where a declaration of incompatibility is made, a party to the proceedings may make an application in writing to the Attorney General for compensation in respect of an injury or loss or damage suffered by him, and if the Government &ldquo;in their discretion&rdquo; considers it appropriate to make an <i>ex gratia </i>payment to that person the Government may request an adviser appointed by it to advise it of the amount of such compensation, if any. The Government may then, &ldquo;in their discretion&rdquo;, make such payment.</P>
    <P>What does that mean? If my rights are violated under the convention I may write to the Attorney General and say I think I should be compensated. The Attorney General, rather than the court, may say that maybe I should or maybe I should not. He may then appoint an adviser who will advise on what compensation might be paid. If this adviser gives advice it can be entirely ignored by the Government, varied, amended, changed or implemented.</P>
    <P>Who is the adviser? Will it be a civil servant in one of the Departments or a friendly solicitor or barrister nominated to deal with the issue? What criteria will be applied in determining who is eligible to be appointed as adviser and what fee the adviser will be paid for the advice forthcoming? This proposal not only undermines the position of our courts in a constitutional system but also confers a function on the Attorney General that he should not exercise and a compensatory power to determine issues of damages on Government which violates the constitutional powers of the courts. It will result in Government taking unto itself a function excluded from it within our constitutional system. This is a deeply flawed Bill that should not have been brought before the House in this form. The Bill requires radical change by amendment and Fine Gael will be proposing such change on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A number of other provisions need to be addressed in greater detail, such as the Attorney General's rights should a case be taken to the European Court for this State's alleged violation of the Convention on Human Rights and the entitlement of the Attorney General to contend that this State is in compliance with the convention even in circumstances where the High Court or Supreme Court have already declared a legislative provision to be incompatible with the convention.</P>
    <P>Because of the deep-seated flaws in the Bill, the wish of the Fine Gael Party to see a much more inclusive measure enacted that truly gives effect to the European Convention on Human Rights and the appalling and scandalous manner in which the Human Rights Commission has been <Col N="313" /> treated by the Government, Fine Gael will be voting against the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The enactment of human rights legislation is an issue of the utmost importance, and the manner in which it is handled is critical. In that context, it is extremely disappointing that Fine Gael finds itself unable to support this legislation. The fact that we find ourselves in such a position today is an appalling reflection on the approach which the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has taken towards the establishment of the Human Rights Commission and the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law.</P>
      <P>The Minister should seriously consider the detailed critique which Deputy Shatter has made of the legislation. He should also seriously consider amendments on Committee Stage. I hope that Deputy Ardagh, who is Chairman of the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, has been listening to the detailed critique which has been made during the debate. It needs to be seriously addressed when this legislation comes before the committee.</P>
      <P>When the history of the establishment of the Human Rights Commission is written and when we look back over what has happened, I am afraid that some very serious issues will have to be reflected upon. The importance of having a strong Human Rights Commission in any country cannot be underestimated and neither can the importance of having a strong Human Rights Commission in this country. It arises in part from commitments given under the Good Friday Agreement, the North-South dimension of which is critical. The history of human rights in this country should have taught us much about the importance of having a strong and independent Human Rights Commission. The Human Rights Commission should have been in a position to comment on the European Convention on Human Rights and its integration into Irish law. However, the commission does not find itself in a position to do that because in this legislation we are also dealing with the mishandling of the original establishment of the commission.</P>
      <P>As of now, therefore, the commission has not been properly established and because of its legal status it is not in a position to comment on the Bill we are debating. As Deputy Shatter said, however, Mr. Justice Donal Barrington has made some comments on it. Any reading of what he has had to say should give the Minister and his Department cause for serious concern. The Minister should reflect on the Bill's contents because Mr. Justice Barrington, who is a very experienced judge, has raised the most serious issues concerning the detail of the legislation and its implications for the courts, not to mention the implications for the individual rights of citizens, because of the way in which the Minister is incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law through this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> Another question that arises is the extraordinary difficulty the Human Rights Commission, although appointed, has had in operating during recent weeks. For example, it was to meet with the equivalent body in the North but a question arose about the status of that meeting and whether it could proceed. We put the Human Rights Commission into a situation where, because of the mishandling of its establishment in the first place, its<i> raison d'être</i> and ability to work in recent months have been seriously undermined. What way is that to establish a Human Rights Commission and what way is that to begin its work?</P>
    <P>A group of people who were chosen by the original selection committee under Dr. Whitaker were left out of the commission. All the NGOs, including groups such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Amnesty International, were seriously concerned about the initial approach that was taken. The Minister attempted to get the Opposition parties to support his approach, which was incorrect. He then reviewed his original decision, decided to change it and brought forward legislation. He delayed bringing forward the legislation, however, to place the commission on a statutory footing and has now incorporated it in this Bill which is incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights. Both measures are being brought in together but the Opposition parties have been requesting for months that the Human Rights Commission should have been dealt with in a separate Bill. This would have corrected the original decision to establish the commission without taking on board those who had been recommended by the selection committee. That would have been a more appropriate approach and would have given the commission the statutory authority to do its work and to comment on relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>Instead, as Deputy Shatter has clearly outlined, there is a badly based and poorly thought out attempt to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law. The approach adopted can compromise our courts, puts decision making on human rights where it should not be, takes it away from a real interpretation of what the convention means and takes it back to arbitrary decision making by the Government to determine compensation levels. It seems to be a very weak-willed approach to human rights and an attempt to water down the importance which the convention could have provided through the courts for Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>All in all, the Bill represents an extraordinarily weak approach to the furtherance of human rights. It is very disappointing. It is clearly a missed opportunity to strengthen both the commission and the future of human rights. It is a poor reflection on the Government's approach to this legislation.</P>

      <P>I regret that so many of us who wished to speak at some length on a matter of fundamental importance find ourselves having to truncate our remarks to meet an arbitrary timeframe. That is a bad way of dealing with important business in the House. I am surprised and disappointed the Minister, who I believed had some regard for issues such as human rights, would treat this House, particularly the Opposition, in this way. It is not a good way of doing business.</P>
      <P>The issue of human rights is fundamental and should be a bridge builder across this House. With few if any exceptions the thrust of agreement on these matters that has been built up in the House would allow us to develop a consensus on matters such as this. I have sought clarity from the Minister in regard to these matters on a daily basis for the past week because it involves two separate issues. The first is rectifying the bad job made of establishing the human rights commission on a statutory basis and the second is transposing the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law. The convention has been around for a long time and following the wind of fresh air that permeated public thought and political discussion in Ireland in 1998 during the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement its transposition into enforceable law in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland, and by extension the United Kingdom, and the rights afforded to the broad European citizenry under it were highlighted.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made a bags of it instead of rectifying the deficiencies that were readily identified at the end of last year in the human rights commission legislation and making sure members of the commission were not further insulted. Simple, amending legislation could have been introduced that would have had the full support of Members. I have made that offer repeatedly on the Order of Business. The Minister gave some consideration to it and to taking a different, more considered approach to the transposition into domestic law of the terms of the convention.</P>
      <P>I am invariably frustrated dealing with the Minister and the Department. They use impenetrable justice speak whenever they produce a speech. I am fearful the Minister is, four years on, a captive of the Department. There is a definite shelf life for anybody working in the Department and the Minister has gone well beyond it.</P>

      <P>The Minister's contribution needs to be unravelled and I will refer to three areas, the debacle concerning the human rights commission, the history of the legislation, including the Good Friday Agreement, and the method of transposition of the convention and our record on human rights. The Minister referred to states generally being slow to take up the option of transposing the convention into legislation in their own jurisdictions. He cited the United Kingdom, which only accepted the jurisdiction of the European Court on Human Rights in 1966, to bolster this argument but we are getting around to it much later than that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter outlined a very good analysis of the method of transposition of the legislation, with which I agree entirely. By design, a minimalist approach has been taken. It is designed to ensure there is an extraordinary mechanism in place to half vindicate rights enunciated in the convention for Irish citizens. The Minister stated in a dense, impenetrable paragraph: &ldquo;The view was taken that it was preferable in our case to leave the convention as a source of non-cognisable and non-justiciable rights in the strict sense.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <P>Let us get out the Oxford English Dictionary. That statement means rights are not enforceable and courts cannot say that one has a certain right under the convention, which has been violated by act of an institution of the State and should be struck down.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incumbent on the Minister to speak to the House in plain English and say he is not transposing the European convention in plain rights terms into basic statute law in this State. Why is that the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated some international conventions like the Lugano convention and the Hague Convention on Child Abduction could be transposed into Irish law but this convention will not be because of the doctrine of the separation of powers. That is justice speak for an entirely different concept. By this, the officials in the Department mean that by protecting the doctrine of the separation of powers it will be ensured that judges of the High Court will keep their noses and fingers out of the Department's affairs so that fundamental rights will not be demanded by courts. It also means that courageous and honourable judges, such as Mr. Justice Peter <Col N="317" /> Kelly, who repeatedly underscores the deficiencies of public administration in vindicating rights of citizens, will not be given any extra powers to trespass on the fiefdom of independent Departments that might vindicate for citizens rights that these Departments and Governments co-operate on and contrive to deprive them of. That is the argument contained in the phrase: &ldquo;.one of the central pillars of the Constitution, doctrine of the separation of powers&rdquo;. The intention is to keep to a minimum the enforceable rights of citizens to rights established under the European convention.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister has bought that line and that he does not have the courage to say that we will risk it because we are in a new era where not only is there a new recognition of fundamental rights, but there is a new economic framework within which the State has the wherewithal to give fundamental rights capable of being enforced through to the courts to marginalised, vulnerable people. That is not to be case. Minimalist transposition will be the method used and it is on a par with the minimalist view taken in the United Kingdom. However, as Deputy Shatter correctly pointed out, it does not even go that far.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated yesterday that there would be an extended Committee Stage debate on all these matters. We will engage with him as regards our views then but in the meantime he has, by insisting on this flawed transposition process and coupling with it the rectification of the flaws in the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, ensured the Human Rights Commission, which has been established for many months, will not have statutory authority, probably, until the next Dáil session in the autumn. That is not only a great pity but an abdication of duty by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I said that to him when I offered, on behalf of this party, a swift and easy passage of that tidy up legislation. He has chosen instead to couple it to an unpopular set of proposals which will, by necessity, take considerable time to process through committee. That is regrettable and bad judgment by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Other Members indicated the views of the president of the Human Rights Commission on this Bill. He is a distinguished jurist and a former Supreme Court judge whom we selected and the Minister endorsed to be the president of the Human Rights Commission &ndash; the first such office holder. We must start as we mean to continue. If we do not have respect for his views on human rights issues, what point is there having a commission or the exalted title of president? He said publicly that the Bill was regrettable and ill-thought out. He went into detail, which I will not quote because Deputy Shatter quoted it and my time is limited, about the identifiable deficiencies in the transposition and how it will affect the rights of citizens of this State to have their full European convention rights vindicated. I will <Col N="318" /> hold most of my powder dry in the time I have left on this matter for another day.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the consequence of having a protracted debate on this contentious issue means that the statutory establishment of the Human Rights Commission in this State will be further delayed. The thought might occur to people that that might be deliberate. It might be designed to ensure the commission will not be statutorily able to comment on this legislation. It would be the supreme irony that the most important first legislative measure involving human rights to come before this House will not be properly commented on by the Human Rights Commission by design of the Minister. His tactics would lead one to believe that is exactly what was intended.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the Irish record on human rights. We are often complacent in this House and in the State to believe that human rights are issues which affect other jurisdictions where there is quantifiable objective oppression to which we are immune. Many believe we do not need a Human Rights Commission because all is well in this emerald State. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. Amnesty International in its audit of all countries last year had some profound things to say about the status of human rights in this State. Among the findings of the 2000 audit of Amnesty International was its main area of concern about the lack of an independent police complaints procedure in this jurisdiction. This is an issue to which I have returned on many occasions. I have returned to it at Question Time and tabled comprehensive proposals which, I must confess, were copied in many ways from the Patten proposals in relation to Northern Ireland. It is appropriate that I refer to them again today because not only are they fundamental to the administration of human rights in this country, but this Bill is part of the same Good Friday process of which Patten is part.</P>
    <P>We must ensure we do not tinker with the police complaints procedure in this House or, as the Minister has repeatedly said, polish the existing internal procedures with some external input from the Garda Complaints Board, but that we instigate a fundamental change by the establishment of an independent police ombudsman modelled on the Northern Ireland model. That case is now unanswerable and doubly so in the context of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights, the Strasbourg court about which we are speaking, in the Loughgall case. It found that the basic rights of the individuals in that case were violated not by any action that was taken, but by the lack of an independent mechanism for investigation of the incident. It found in its judgment that it was not possible for the force being investigated to carry out the investigation through the separation of units within the force.</P>
    <P>There is now an unanswerable case to implement the proposals I have argued in favour of for a long time, such as the establishment of a police ombudsman. I was slightly heartened by the most recent reaction to these proposals at the <Col N="319" /> last Question Time to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I did not get as emphatic a rejection as I got on previous occasions. I have no doubt we will have an opportunity to come back to the issue of Garda accountability through an ombudsman and a new Garda authority. I drafted both proposals and the time has now come to implement them.</P>
    <P>The second comment made by the Amnesty International audit was about the rights of prisoners. It referred to the absence of an effective safeguard to prevent the ill treatment of prisoners. We have been awaiting the prisons Bill for a long time which, we understand, will include an independent prisons inspectorate. When will we see the concrete proposals to establish, on a statutory basis, the prison service and what nature and type of independent inspectorate will be established? These are issues the Minister should address. We cannot dismiss international reports from respected organisations because we are a developed, open and democratic State and, therefore, those criticisms do not apply to us, they only apply to a Third World or undemocratic state. I hope the Minister responds to this point in his reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the comments of the director general of the prison service, Mr. Aylward, who has promised the publication and implementation of new prison rules. When will those rules be published? Will there be any democratic input into them? Will they be brought before the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in order that we can discuss them? That is the type of open way to deal with these matters, which should be the hallmark of a developing, open and transparent society.</P>
    <P>I will not have time to talk about the Offences Against the State Act which will continue in operation or to inquire about the Minister's intentions in relation to it, which is unfortunate. I would have hoped the Minister would have accepted the bona fides of the Members of this side of the House to facilitate the early enactment of basic legislation to put on a proper and acceptable basis the Human Rights Commission and to give us the time, space and an openness of mind to see how the European Convention on Human Rights can be transposed in this jurisdiction in a way that has the broadest possible good effect for the citizens of this State. If we do not make radical decisions which upset Administrations, it is likely that our decisions are inadequate. If we want to advance human rights, it must be done in a way which affects the <i>status quo</i> and those in charge of institutions in this State.</P>
    <P>There is an inherent reluctance to take that step and half a century after the Convention on Human Rights was first adopted we are still dragging reluctant Administrations into the understanding of, and vindication of basic human rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin for giving me five minutes of his time. I join other Opposition spokespersons in expressing regret that the Minister has chosen this method of dealing with the two very important issues of the establishment of the Human Rights Commission and the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law.</P>
      <P>I fully support what my colleague, Deputy Howlin said both today and previously, on the fact that we would have facilitated the Minister in bringing forward a short Bill which would have dealt with outstanding matters with regard to the establishment of the Human Rights Commission. This would have allowed the commission to be up and running on a statutory basis well before the summer recess in accordance with both our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement, and the expectations of very many groups in this country. This has been awaited for a long time and many people feel it will be a very substantial addition in the human rights area in this country.</P>
      <P>One group which has been awaiting this commission in terms of its rights is people with disabilities. The promised disabilities Bill has been long in coming and has now been shoved on to the end of this year. These people feel they will need the Human Rights Commission to vindicate many of their rights, because there appears to be no political will to bring forward specific legislation with regard to them. This applies to many other areas as well.</P>
      <P>As I have a short period of time, I will concentrate on the substance of this Bill which is the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law. I add my voice to the voices of those who have already expressed deep disappointment, not only in this House. Mr. Justice Barrington, and others outside this House have expressed disappointment about the minimalist method the Minister has chosen to undertake in this regard. As Deputy Howlin has said, this convention has been in existence for half a century and we would have hoped that when we incorporated it into our laws it would make a real difference in terms of people's opportunities to vindicate their human rights. It is so minimalist that I have to ask whether it will really make much difference at all. The method the Minister has chosen in incorporating it will inevitably provide issues around the question of the Constitution and the rights under this convention. Will people still have to go to the European Court of Human Rights in order to vindicate matters that are of concern to them, having gone through all of the processes under our national jurisdiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the case of our Oireachtas colleague, Senator David Norris, who in 1988, was granted the rights under the European Convention, that had been denied to him under our legislation. I suggest that if this measure which the Minister is proposing today had been incorporated at that time he would still have had to go to Europe to vindicate his rights because of the conflict with the Constitution and that even though he would <Col N="321" /> have established a right under the convention, he would not have had remedy for that right. I suggest to the Minister that we are really not taking the opportunity that is there under this legislation and that is a terrible shame.</P>
    <P>I also put it to the Minister that there will be many groups who will wish to express their views to the committee and if that is facilitated, which it should be, and if the amount of time that is needed is provided, as it should be in order to go into the deeply complex aspects of this, then we will not enact the legislation before the summer recess. There are many groups that have already expressed concern and I have no doubt they will have something to say with regard to this. As legislators we should listen to them.</P>
    <P>As equality spokesperson for the Labour Party, I am deeply concerned that this is such a very small step when it could have been a much larger, broader and more meaningful one in terms of advancing human rights here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin for giving me five minutes to put down a few markers as he and other colleagues have done. Like him, Deputies Shatter, O'Sullivan and Fitzgerald I want to express my sense of disappointment on two levels. We are trying to respond to one of the most important Bills to come through this House that will, I hope, affect generations and we are sharing time in allotments of five minutes, because of the truncated guillotined way in which the Second Stage is being taken. Second Stage is usually an opportunity to discuss, not just the contents, but the policy, direction and commitment of that Bill, all of which is lamentably short, no more than the time allowed to us here to address it.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed and hugely annoyed by this Bill. Members on this side of the House have urged the Minister again and again, and the Taoiseach on the Order of Business to take a fast track approach and introduce an amending Bill with which everybody on this side of the House would agree, given that this Bill arose out of the chaotic way the setting up of the Human Rights Commission was bungled. We do not have it on a statutory basis that would allow the authority, support, resources and respect for a Human Rights Commission that is sorely lacking. To set it up in this slipshod way, in this derisory minimalist way, to have to go back and not to have the representation and the full cross population of this country included in that in the first place is a reflection of the way this Bill is being dragged through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provided an opportunity. I saw this Human Rights Commission, as did my colleagues, as a wonderful piece of bridge building, a bridge to be built between North and South. It is to our shame and embarrassment that the Northern Ireland commission is up and running and we are still dragging this Bill in this way through this House. It could also have been bridge building to the extent that everybody here on this side of the <Col N="322" /> House wanted to work with the Government and the Minister in bringing about a fundamental, positive, supportive Bill, on what the Minister himself called the most fundamental right, human rights. We are not doing that.</P>
    <P>I concur with what Deputy Shatter said particularly on sections 3 and 5, and I hope one of the things we can do arising from this, is study models of good practice and listen to people on Committee Stage. God knows, we have left it long enough to be able to see models of good practice all over the world, particularly at European level. I appeal to the Minister to look again at our minimalist approach to this. The British Act requires that new legislation be European Convention proofed. We have done that with some other legislation here. Why is a similar provision not in this Bill? There is still time and I hope the Minister and his officials will take on board what we have just begun, and respond in the way that Members across the House have asked them to, so that people in a sovereign State such as that we were trying to establish during the Nice treaty referendum, can stand proudly with the other European member states that have done this long before us and with far greater alacrity and far greater spirit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note the progression of human rights generally. The Minister referred to the natural law philosophers of Greece, Roman law and the American and French Declarations of Independence, but we could not but look at the Proclamation of Poblacht na hÉireann in which there is one sentence which is very relevant. It states, &ldquo;The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally, and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past&rdquo;. That informed the drafters of the 1937 Constitution in which there is enshrined a formal written bill of rights.</P>
      <P>The European Convention on Human Rights was a product of certain people in response to the Holocaust and the awful atrocities that occurred in the Second World War. They saw fundamental human rights as a foundation for justice and peace and they hoped they would be implemented into the laws of countries throughout Europe in particular.</P>
      <P>The Commission issued a memorandum in 1979 requesting the communities to become signatories to the European Convention <i>en bloc</i>, and there was a great deal of argument in various governments and Parliaments. At the time, the House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities took the view that &ldquo;the immediate practical gains of accession are likely to be limited, the benefits being largely indirect and to some extent symbolic&rdquo;. There were problems even then. Again, in 1990, the European Commission set out to get the various countries to consolidate human rights in the community but the European Court of Justice ruled that out of order in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of why it has taken so long for the convention to be transposed into legislation, as the Minister said, in 1996 the Constitution review group talked about the incorporation of the convention directly into the Constitution. It said at that time that the Constitution was so <Col N="324" /> complete in relation to human rights that the European convention would cloud some of the issues that were clear in the Irish Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitutional method of recognising and protecting fundamental rights was advanced for its time but the Constitution review group felt it contained certain flaws and that there was a need for revision. Because of the strength of the Constitution and the importance of the European Convention on Human Rights, I agree with the Minister that statute law and rules of common law should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the State's obligations under the convention, and that statutory powers and the exercise of public law functions by the State agencies should be carried out in a manner conformable with the convention.</P>
      <P>Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights states, &ldquo;Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority, notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity&rdquo;. That is encompassed in the Bill and the Minister has already outlined the various remedies that are available, and the whole concept of incompatibility The question of compensation was raised and who would decide on the amount, but that is a matter for discussion on Committee Stage, although I acknowledge it is a valid point to raise. That is an important part of the Bill which is not included in the United Kingdom law because it believes parliamentary sovereignty is supreme.</P>
      <P>The incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights was a long way off until the Good Friday Agreement whereby the Governments, acting together under that Agreement, decided the convention was an important element of it. It has been incorporated in respect of Northern Ireland since October 2000 and I am delighted it is being incorporated into this Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to mention a number of articles in the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 1 states that everyone's right to life shall be protected by law. There is a further protocol, the abolition of the death penalty, and I am delighted that the recent referendum on the death penalty was successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 2.2 states that the deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary. There are three sub-paragraphs to that <Col N="325" /> article. Certain bodies in the State will have to examine the way they work to ensure all the articles in the European Convention on Human Rights are fully taken into account in any rules of procedure or engagement being drafted.</P>
      <P>Article 4.2 states that no one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour. Article 5.2 states that everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and the charge against him. That raises the whole question of certain asylum seekers having to work in enforced labour in a country to repay the person who brought them to that country.</P>
      <P>On the question of the language, as referred to in Article 5.2, we would have a problem in that regard. As a cosmopolitan country, we will have to improve our linguistic skills and I am delighted we will have the opportunity to do that and that we will be encouraged to do so.</P>
      <P>Article 8.1 states that everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. I wonder whether one should add, &ldquo;except for Oireachtas Members&rdquo;, as we do not seem to have the right to respect for our private and family lives. This issue has already been discussed on the Electoral Bill but we might be able to bring about a change in the Public Offices Commission under the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to this debate. This Bill is compatible with the UK legislation but, in a number of respects, it goes further than that legislation. I make this point, particularly in response to Deputy Shatter's contribution. The Bill goes further in that it incorporates Article 13 and provides a remedy where declarations of incompatibility are made by the courts. In those two respects the Bill goes further than the British legislation.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement does not provide that this jurisdiction must incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into law. The option is, and was, always there for Irish Governments to do so since ratification in 1950. However, no Government chose to do so until this Government decided to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into law. There is no obligation to do so under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>The points made by Deputy Shatter regarding declarations of incompatibility are more relevant to Committee Stage and I have already indicated that additional time will be made available on that Stage to discuss this legislation. Deputies will be aware that I do not order the business of the House. However, the Government Chief Whip has made it clear that additional time will be made available. All Deputies will welcome that measure and will have the opportunity to make a full and complete contribution if they so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the exclusion of the courts, it is not accepted that citizens of Northern Ireland enjoy <Col N="326" /> greater protection than citizens in this jurisdiction. In my speech I stated that our courts are required to act in accordance with the law and the Constitution. The limitation period of one year, to which Deputy Shatter also referred, can be extended by the courts if they so desire. I stated that this period of one year is required because of the importance for the State of the areas which may be impugned. The powers to make declarations are tied to the Superior Courts in the same way as those courts alone have jurisdiction to strike down unconstitutional statutes.</P>
    <P>The courts cannot award compensation because, under the scheme of the Bill, rational provisions remain in force until they are changed by law. In other words, provisions which exist would have to be changed by law. The role of the Attorney General is limited by the Bill to one of notification. The Government will decide the matter and the Attorney General has no jurisdiction or function because the Government&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was used and drafted by the constitutional review group. Deputy Howlin has lost sight of the fact that recent developments in the Superior Courts regarding human rights issues have been constitutionally based. In effect, all the unenumerated rights to which the Deputy referred are home-grown and do not derive from the European Convention on Human Rights. The argument has been made by people far more versed in human rights, that the Supreme Court, through its liberal interpretation of the human rights provisions of the 1937 Constitution, and, in particular, in its elucidation of unenumerated rights, has, on many occasions, gone further with regard to the protection of human rights and freedoms in this jurisdiction than the European Convention on Human Rights. Many jurists, not just in this country, but world-wide, have expressed great appreciation for the work of some of our more eminent judges. Many of these judges are deceased, but some are still active in our courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take on board the views of the Human Rights Commission. However, that does not necessarily mean I have to accept what it says. The commission, and its chairman, are entitled to <Col N="327" /> their opinions and, whether they are on an interim or statutory footing, any Government will listen to what they have to say and give careful consideration to their deliberations and expressions. However, it is a matter for the Government to govern and for the Human Rights Commission to perform its functions, pursuant to the statute under which it is being established.</P>

      <P>It is, to a certain degree, the function of the Human Rights Commission to interface with the Government if it is to represent the public. At no stage would I wish to have a Human Rights Commission in this State which felt it was in some way subject to the views of the Government or anyone else. No commission could fulfil its functions if it played such a role. I have made it clear from the outset that the intention is that the commission will be independent in the exercise of its functions. It is heart-warming to hear the commission express views which I may not hold.</P>

The drafting of the prisons Bill is at an advanced stage, but that issue is also for another day. I hope to shortly deliberate on the Hederman committee which is reviewing the Offences against the State Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the case referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan, if the provisions of this Bill were in force in 1988, the Supreme Court would have issued a declaration of incompatibility and it would then have been up to the court to rectify the position. Effectively that is what happened. If <Col N="328" /> the Bill had been applied it would have happened within months, rather than the long hiatus to which the Deputy referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes is normally constructive, but I reject her suggestion that the appointments to the Human Rights Commission were bungled or performed in a slipshod manner. The Government had to act in accordance with the Act and the Government of the day has to preserve its freedom to appoint people from a broad spectrum of society to the board in question.</P>

I did not wish to see the Human Rights Commission strangled at birth and, therefore, I went back to the drawing board and decided to increase the number of persons on the commission. This was not an act of cuteness, or anything like that, but an act of magnanimity to ensure we would have a broad spectrum of society dealing with this issue. That is precisely what occurred.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>The section relating to directly elected mayors and cathaoirligh of county councils will be of little value to the affairs of county councils unless a change is made to the powers granted. There is a need to give them executive functions. I cannot understand the reason we cannot consider extending the powers of directly elected mayors under the present system whereby the mayor or cathaoirleach is elected by members of the county council. Following the election if the powers were extended, it would satisfy the function of mayor far better than electing the person directly from the general electorate. On Committee Stage we should look at this suggestion again. I do not see any demand from the electorate for a directly elected chair and there is no reason for it. The deficit in local democracy can be addressed by changing the role of mayor from a temporary to a permanent position. It can also be addressed by taking powers away from officials and giving them back to the elected members of corporations and county councils, particularly mayors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new local government structures, in terms of the strategic policy committees, have exercised the minds of those of us involved in local government. They are, simply, another layer of bureaucracy. I cannot see them functioning as designed and having the necessary backup staff to ensure they function properly and efficiently. It would be far better to focus on the financial deficit within local authorities and ensure moneys required to make projects happen are directed to them rather than through a heavily bureaucratic system. The cost of this bureaucracy at local level in Kilkenny <Col N="331" /> will be in the region of £1 million. Unless we measure this against the demand on the ground for projects to be completed, and give the money, we are not creating an effective and efficient local government system.</P>
    <P>Looking at the 246 sections within the Bill, were one to ask any member of the local authority what immediate reform would change the workings of local government forever, they would refer to managers. The managers of every local authority, while they are all good men and women doing a fine job, have too much power.</P>
    <P>They deal with everything and local authority members are rubber stamping the decisions already taken in a system dominated by bureaucrats. It is time we reformed local government and, if we are serious about empowering it, gave powers to mayors, chairmen and elected representatives. The manager should not just work in a consultative process but in partnership with and sharing power with the elected representatives. We are creating a situation where the general public is annoyed and frustrated with public representatives because they believe we have the power when we do not, everything is a function of the manager. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I recognise there are many good public officials keeping the local government system going and do not want to take away from them in this contribution. The system does not allow them to follow a positive career path and move from their grade without great disruption. There needs to be a freeing up of the structure to ensure good people are kept in the system. They should be paid more than they are because the private sector is robbing the system of the qualified people serving local government.</P>
    <P>I take particular issue with the interview process in local government, where employees of local government at particular levels interview those seeking position in their counties. As a result, there is an internal system of interviewing which does not serve the system properly. We should introduce a new system where an independent company becomes part of the interview process in order that we could get the best people from either the public or private sectors to serve in these positions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly disappointed with and protest in the strongest possible terms at the way in which this Bill is being dealt with. Those of us with a lot of experience at local level went to a lot of trouble researching speeches for Second Stage but we, in Fine Gael, in particular, now find ourselves with five minutes per slot, which is absolutely disgraceful. This Bill was available for the last 12 months but was not brought to the House until it could be rushed through. It is as simple as that and I protest in the strongest possible terms.</P>
      <P>I will not have time to say so but I agree with most of what Deputy McGuinness said. Regarding the financing of local government, the abolition of domestic rates in 1977 did more damage to local government than anything done for 50 years beforehand or since. That was the great Fianna Fáil manifesto: free rates and car tax and everything else that went with it. The abolition of agricultural rates was the result of a court case and the abolition of domestic water charges was a little to do with us, as two Governments were involved. When the present Minister took office he said he would change this but he has changed absolutely nothing.</P>
      <P>These issues have a major impact on local government resources and their management. Since the abolition of charges local authorities are depending on central government to supplement their incomes for the loss of funding. The growth in the economy in the last ten to 15 years indicates very strongly that the loss in potential revenue from these sources of income has been a major loss to local authorities across the country. The replacement funding, that is, the rate support grant, the equalisation fund and now local government funding, has not kept pace with the potential growth in those funding sources, with minimal increases being applied.</P>
      <P>Significant increased costs, both in the provision and operation of services, are being experienced because of the increased and stringent requirements imposed by EU directives and regulations, particularly in the areas of road construction, operation of landfill sites, bridge construction, water quality, water and sewage treatment, etc. Water and sewage treatment are causing local authorities huge problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has been instrumental in restricting the main source of discretionary funding by way of capping annual rate increases. <Col N="333" /> Projects are limited by way of specific funding being allocated centrally and such limitations have impacted on the level of services available and the projects are being curtailed.</P>
    <P>The Celtic tiger has put an increased strain on local authority financing. All services from the local authority have experienced increased customer numbers and caseloads, while many of the services have no source of local income attached to them. That is important. During the years we have seen the Department time and again put an extra burden on a county council with no finance provided, that is what is causing the awful problems of local government.</P>
    <P>Increasing demand for the services of local authorities has led to increases in staff numbers to meet those demands and we will see a significant cost increase due to the increasing staff requirements to maintain services. Every county councillor knows that in the last three months we got a direction from headquarters, the Department, about these staff increases and to establish new structures. Wexford County Council has a bill in the region of £1 million but what the Department has failed to do is to explain where the money is to come from. Every county council is the same. We are to have better local government and various things are to happen but unfortunately very little is happening.</P>
    <P>New legislation is being published regularly and will impact on the operation of a local authority, which, in turn, imposes financial pressures. Recent legislation having such an impact includes the Freedom of Information Act, the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, the waste management, litter and water quality legislation.</P>
    <P>As infrastructure within local authorities is expanding through the development of the road, water and sewage networks, so too does the huge cost of routine maintenance and operation which must be funded from the narrowing income sources base which is restricted by cap or linked to inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo Deputy D'Arcy's comment that we were not allocated enough time to deal with this Bill which is of supreme importance. Enough time should be allowed for us to discuss it fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That said, a radical and imaginative reform of our current structures is required. The introduction of strategic policy committees is a step forward and the manner of their development requires ongoing work. As a long-serving member of a local authority, I have watched the evolution of the SPCs which are working well, particularly in my local authority, Fingal County Council. I see real developments in the field of infrastructure, in issuing grants to local communities and in the housing strategy we just completed, which is working very well. We are blessed in that local authority in that we have an excellent manager who looks to the future, Mr. Soffe, and who is very conscious of Fingal as a <Col N="334" /> new council. He can see it developing far into the future and I compliment him on his foresight.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure the voice of the people is heard and acted upon. My understanding of the democratic system is that the people exercise their vote, providing a mandate for a particular person. Should that person receive sufficient support, then they stand elected to speak and act on behalf of the electorate. It is important that democracy prevails and that ordinary people's views are reflected and that special interest groups are not allowed influence beyond which they merit. Such groups should and must be listened to and should be encouraged to help inform the public, providing education and sharing their specialist knowledge in a way which develops and educates the electorate. It is important that people understand the issues and, through their votes, elect a council that truly reflects the people's views. The councillor must be empowered by knowledge and must be given the support structures within the local authority to interact and communicate with the electors. The proposals exist in this Bill to at least pay a salary to elected councillors, a salary which should not be set at the discretion of a Minister but which should be linked in this Bill to a percentage of a Deputy's salary. It should reflect the years of service of a member of a local authority.</P>
    <P>That said, what most local authority members require is adequate office and secretarial services which would allow them to get best value from the time they invest in helping to shape their communities. The Bill addresses new financial management systems. I suggest some changes in the area of finance generation for local authorities. While councils may draw up plans for their areas, they are reliant on the property owner to take up those ideas. There is an opportunity for councils to become more fundamentally involved in the shaping and development of their county.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the issue of commercial rates and how valuation is applied. This is not used in the best interests of business, councils and local communities. County councils must be allowed to construct a rating system to reflect how they wish their county to develop. Special rates relief incentives could be put in place to encourage, for example, the refurbishment of shop fronts to the desired style which a council may wish to promote within a town. Some industries require special assistance, for example, the agri-business industry which adds value to products and is fighting to service the growing supermarket business.</P>
    <P>The Bill should establish a requirement and a system to allow local authority members to make declarations of donations each year as a matter of course. The Minister recognises the increasing role of councillors. He should also recognise that their activities must be funded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Echoing what colleagues have said, it is a disgrace that for such an important Bill <Col N="335" /> Members are offered just five minutes to speak. This Bill has more than 270 sections. I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, to pass on my regards to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, as I understand he is sick. I hope he has a swift recovery.</P>
      <P>This is the Minister's Stalingrad. This is the legislation on which he has been working for the past four years. This Minister was going to deliver the knock-out blow to those in the House who wished to retain the dual mandate. He has failed. He should resign as that is the only honourable course of action open to him. I am not surprised that another Fianna Fáil Minister has got it so wrong in relation to local government. In 1977, the rape of local government really took place, when the Government, led by Mr. Lynch, decided to abolish the only genuine source of revenue open to local government &ndash; the rates structure.</P>
      <P>We will continue to debate this legislation without any adequate form of funding for local government. Until that issue is debated, and it is not included in this legislation, we will continue to have interesting discussions, but those discussions will get us nowhere. Unless the issue of funding is resolved, local government will not have the power it deserves.</P>
      <P>It is shameful the way in which this Government has treated the House on the issue of the dual mandate. Yesterday the Minister outlined in public that he will drop the prohibition on the dual mandate. That has not been discussed at Cabinet yet. I was under the illusion that Cabinet confidentiality applied to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government as it does to all Ministers. Obviously, that is not true in this case. He has suffered a humiliating climbdown in his efforts to placate the four Independent Members who support the Government.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be unfair to those four Members, but they contribute very little to this House. They do not make a substantial contribution as they rarely speak in the House. When one compares the contributions of my colleague Deputy Ring, who is an active member of a local authority and an active Member of the House, it is evident that he regularly speaks on national legislation. The four Members propping up the current Government do not. It is interesting that they have so little to say about national legislation and this has been the case for the past four years. We are in a pickle at present because the Government has not developed this legislation in year one or year two of holding office. It has nothing to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ridiculous that we are to introduce this new electoral system without giving additional powers to the new mayors. Those new mayors will have some small co-ordinating powers but they will not have the power to raise money, or to spend money as those in a mayoral position should be able to do. That is a huge deficit in the Bill. On the issue of funding, in my county substantial sums of money in the county capital account can<Col N="336" /> not be spent because the rules that provide for expenditure of local government funds do not allow flexibility in the way we spend our money. That needs to be looked at in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Tallaght, which is a part of my constituency, has a population of 80,000. It is the size of Limerick city, yet it has ten councillors representing 80,000 people. Limerick city has a corporation of about 16 members. This is a bad day for the Government and the Minister should consider his position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I am outraged, as one who has been in public life for 22 years, that Members get five minutes to speak on the most important legislation that has come before this House. First, however, I congratulate the Taoiseach, Deputy Healy-Rae, the Tánaiste, Deputy Fox, the Minister for social welfare, Deputy Gildea, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Blaney, on winning the day.</P>
      <P>I will not be dishonest and say I do not welcome this. In Russia, when there was no democracy, people complained that there was a dictatorship. I agree. I was a member of an urban district council, a county council and the Dáil. I made a decision at the last local elections that I was not going to stand for the urban council after 21 years in that office. I loved the urban council and wanted to stay on it, but I could not give the time. I was free to make that decision. Why should a Government deprive an individual of the right to stand for an office. It is outrageous.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder that the people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in last week's referendum on the Nice Treaty. They did so because they are sick and tired of being told how to vote. What do Ministers or the Civil Service know more than the general public? If there was a general election, and I did not like the result, would I have another go the following week? That is not the way democracy works. Democracy is democracy. There is no longer democracy in local government.</P>
      <P>I am glad to get the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Managers have taken over. They have too much power. There is no power coming down to the elected representative. That is the aspect of this Bill that should be coming before the Dáil. This is what needs to be discussed and why we want an opportunity to debate this Bill. It is the most important legislation to come through the House in 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no apology for elected representatives and councillors. They do an excellent job in difficult circumstances. It is not easy to be an elected representative at this time in Ireland, whether one is a councillor, a TD or a Minister. One cannot go to Mass on a Sunday, to a football match or anywhere else without being asked to do things for people. That is the way democracy works. When one puts oneself in the front line one must be prepared for that. However, I see no reason councillors should not be paid. What is wrong in this House is that we are afraid to speak the truth. <Col N="337" /> I welcome the fact that the dual mandate will not be abolished. Why should anybody tell me whether I can or cannot stand for the council, the Dáil, the European Parliament or the Presidency? It is the people who decide, that is democracy. If some people do not like that they have a few choices. They can walk out of here this evening and give their resignation note to the Ceann Comhairle, next week we will have a by-election and someone else will be elected. Anyone who does not like the county council can resign from it.</P>
    <P>We must take the power from the chief executives of health boards and the county managers and give it to elected representatives. They are the people who go before the interview board every five years and the interview is becoming increasingly difficult. The interview board will decide if they want to elect us, not the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Healy-Rae or anyone else. At the last election one-third of the Members of this House were not returned. I predict that half of the Members of this House will not come back after the next election and it will not be voluntary retirement, they will be retired by the electorate.</P>
    <P>We should discuss what powers we can give to elected representatives. Instead, this most important Bill has been guillotined by the Government and we do not have an opportunity to debate it. What are the Government plans to bring power back to the Members and the people? Power should not be given to faceless, unelected individuals. They do not have to stand for election. I would love to see included in this Bill a provision where the county manager and secretary would have to stand for election every five years as is done in America. That is real democracy.</P>
    <P>When it comes to Traveller halting sites, every time the question of halting sites is raised at a council meeting the solution is to position them near working-class housing estates. They are not ever built near well-off areas. I welcome halting sites in every local authority housing estate, but only if they are spread around, but that is not what happens. It is always a matter of keeping the small man down. That is why we had the reaction last week in the Treaty of Nice referendum. The vote was not an anti-Europe one. It was anti-health board, anti-council, anti-planning laws and anti-politician. I have made the prediction that 40% of the Members of this House will not be back. The people are waiting. There are too many &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men and women. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle tells me my time has expired. but I have a great deal more to say on this. It is outrageous that we are given only five minutes to discuss such an important Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Cooper-Flynn. I must respond to some of the comments of Fine Gael Members. I am struck by their hypocrisy. I was shocked to hear them complaining about the loss of domestic and agri<Col N="338" /> cultural rates, motor tax revenue, domestic water rates and the capping of commercial rates. The clear implication from that is if they had their way they would reintroduce those rates, increase motor tax and lift the cap on commercial rates which would result in enormous annual increases at estimates time.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed at their shallow attack on the Minister and the four Independent Deputies who are elected to this House the same as everyone else. It proves the shallowness of the Opposition parties' commitment to support the passage of the Second Stage of this Bill if the Independents did not support the Government. That was a shallow promise and one which the Government could not have relied on. The Government is better off relying on itself and the Independents.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, it is a major initiative by the Minister and one which he has worked on for a long time. He has shown his commitment to local government since he took office and has presided over a dramatic increase in funding. The only problem most local authorities have is spending the money allocated to them. Very few can meet the targets of their house building or road works programmes. If their books were examined it would become apparent that there is no lack of available funds. There are sufficient funds being given to local authorities and we must ensure they are spent properly.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the proliferation of committees at local authority level. I was first elected to a local authority at the last council election. I found that Laois County Council elected members to 32 different committees, the vast majority of which I had not ever heard of before, for example drainage boards and burial boards. I could not believe it. Half of those bodies are a farce. They serve no useful purpose and should be integrated into normal council activities. I do not know what they were there for in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am giving serious consideration to putting down an amendment at Committee Stage regarding local authority boundaries. I want the Minister to take note of this. Graiguecullen is in the administrative county of Laois and the Dáil constituency of Laoighis-Offaly. The people there have been disenfranchised. They were not entitled to vote in the elections to Laois County Council. They vote in Carlow County Council and Carlow Urban District Council elections under an agreement reached some years ago. Their area is not administered by either of those councils. Their constitutional right to vote for the local authority which administers the area in which they reside has been taken from them. That is due to an anomaly where the electoral boundaries were changed but the administrative boundaries were not. Before the Bill completes its passage through this House I demand that provision be made for electoral boundaries to correspond with the functional boundaries of a local <Col N="339" /> authority. A similar anomaly exists in a town in County Louth which borders County Meath.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to respond by saying this can be examined by the new Electoral Boundary Commission. This was referred to in the Electoral Area Boundary Commission report of 1998 which stated &ldquo;the boundary of County Laois was altered by the Local Government (Boundaries) (Town Elections) Regulations, 1994, to exclude a small part of the electoral division of Graigue Rural in County Laois and to include it within the boundary of County Carlow for electoral purposes.&rdquo; That should not have happened and must now be reversed. The electoral boundaries must be brought back to the administrative functional boundaries. It is disgraceful that those people are disenfranchised and do not have a vote in the local authority area in which they reside. I ask the Minister to put down an amendment. If he does not, I will be forced to do so on behalf of the people of Graiguecullen who live in County Laois. I acknowledge that part of Graiguecullen is in County Carlow but I refer to the part in County Laois.</P>
    <P>My single biggest complaint about this Bill regards finances and how the annual budget and estimates procedures will be run. I am pleased to see the annual budget must be published seven days in advance and at the budget meeting &ndash; formerly known as the estimates meeting &ndash; members shall, by resolution adopt the budget with or without amendments. I am gravely disappointed there is a separate section dealing with the capital programme. The county manager is solely responsible for the programme and elected members have no input to development levies, proceeds from sale of land or where those are reinvested. That is strictly within the remit of the county manager. Under the legislation the situation is made worse because all the manager will need to do is submit a report to members which they may consider &ndash; they are not obliged to do so. Council members will have no authority to do anything about such reports and they do not have to adopt or pass comment on them. That is outrageous.</P>
    <P>The annual estimates should deal with both capital and revenue expenditure. There is over £20 million in the revenue account of Laois County Council every year and a further £20 million in its capital account and it is outrageous that only the revenue aspect of the council's activities is the estimates meeting. Some of the major decisions that affect the county are arrived at through the capital account process. This provision needs to be amended on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty with managers being the only people who can act in any legal action taken on behalf of councils. There are many instances in which members should be entitled to legal advice. Laois County Council had a number of difficulties with its county development and waste management plans and we were informed that the <Col N="340" /> county manager acts as legal adviser to members. That is unsatisfactory because we are individuals representing the public and should have access to proper legal advice. The decision taken in respect of this matter must be reversed.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I intend to propose an amendment to remove the proposal from section 182 whereby the Minister's consent is required if land is being disposed of at less than its commercial value. That is impractical because there are many good reasons a council would want to take action of this nature. It should be within the remit of councils to make their own decisions which would be subject to annual audit. I ask that the section to which I refer be deleted on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Local Government Bill. I have been a member of a county council since September 1996 and, therefore, speak as someone who has experience of working in the local government sector. When I first joined the county council there was a perception among councillors that our main job was to rubber-stamp policy decisions put forward by officials of the council and the county manager. Many were of the opinion that the councillors were ineffective and I am delighted that this perception will be changed as a result of this Bill's introduction. I am surprised that all Members do not fully support many of the provisions it contains.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to hear my colleague from County Mayo speak about the importance of the dual mandate, particularly when one considers that on local radio earlier this week he stated that our local county council is ineffective. The Deputy has now stated that it is vital for him to continue to serve as a representative for County Mayo.</P>
      <P>It is important for public representatives to be able to sit on local authorities &ndash; I do so myself &ndash; because it keeps us in close contact with the people. The system that operates in Ireland, when compared to those in Britain and throughout Europe, allows public representatives to be fully aware of what is needed in their constituencies. This makes us more effective in terms of our ability to act on behalf of our constituents at both local and national level.</P>
      <P>In the Bill the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has set about trying to give power back to the democratically elected representatives who are closest to the people. Having served as a member of a local authority, the Minister recognises the important role played by county councillors and urban councillors. He has also dealt with one of the most significant issues in this area, namely, funding for local authorities, and introduced measures in recent years which have enabled local authorities to put in place policies that are in the best interests of communities. In addition, he has provided funding to allow them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> For many years before I became a councillor in 1996, local authorities had been starved of money. Funding was being allocated to other local development initiatives operated by people who had not been elected. This meant that power was being taken away from those who had been democratically elected. Matters will now be set to rights, however, in the light of the additional powers being conferred on the elected members of councils. That is the reason this Bill is so important.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, who set down as one of his priorities when entering office the putting in place of the local government fund. He achieved this through the introduction of legislation in 1998 and the fund is delivering significant additional resources. In 2001, £730 million is being provided for local authorities. In terms of the general purpose needs of local authorities, the fund is delivering almost 64% more than in 1997. That is a true measure of the success of the policies the Minister is implementing at local level.</P>
    <P>For a county the size of Mayo, the diameter of which is 140 miles, particularly in terms of promoting better efficiency, new measures are badly needed and they are being provided in the Bill. People in the county are obliged to travel to Castlebar to tax their cars. For many of them, this involves a round trip of 130 or 140 miles. It is simply unacceptable in this age of technological advances that this type of archaic system remains in operation. I welcome the provision in the Bill which will allow for the creation of one-stop-shops. Everyone is in favour of providing services and this mechanism will give us an opportunity to do so, thereby replacing the outrageously outdated system which obtains at present. I welcome the establishment of these pilot programmes which will be of major benefit and make councils much more efficient.</P>
    <P>County councils and local authorities are only as good as their members. Many criticise both the level of debate that takes place in local authorities and the nature of some of the items which appear for discussion on their agendas. However, councillors are not provided with the information and training programmes they require, the level of debate that is expected and needed at local level will not be achieved.</P>
    <P>An important element of the provisions in the Bill centres on the strategic policy committees. These provide an opportunity for elected members to produce policy in co-operation with local interest groups and have it properly debated at council meetings. I welcome the fact that strategic policy committees are already in place. In my county a number of committees are operational and will begin bringing minutes to the main council meetings in September.</P>
    <P>I wish to address a number of issues with which this sizeable Bill deals. I will first comment on Part 3, section 19, which relates to co-options. I welcome the provision which will allow a party which loses a member on a council to nominate <Col N="342" /> a replacement. I was co-opted to Mayo County Council in 1996 and I am delighted that the system was in place at the time. However, I am aware that in other local authority areas throughout the country parties which lost members were not always allowed to co-opt replacements.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that under Part 4, section 26, elections will take place every five years. Accountability is the number one priority for local councillors when dealing with members of the community who are entitled to voice their opinions on the effectiveness of the council which represents them. They can only do so if there is a guarantee that elections will not be postponed and that they must be held at five year intervals.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal now with the issue of committees and, in particular, the fact that statutory recognition of the strategic policy committees is catered for in section 48. Anyone who tries to argue in the future that county councils are ineffective will have only themselves to blame because it will be the responsibility of members to give the dedication, time and energy required to develop policies at the committees which will be meaningful and of real benefit to the constituencies they represent. I welcome the fact that this is provided for in Part 7.</P>
    <P>With regard to the functions of local authorities, the objective for county and town councils to take steps for a more unified and improved customer service for the public is critical, particularly in counties similar in size to Mayo. It is vitally important that we provide a service for the people we represent and make it easy for them to access that service.</P>
    <P>On the question of finance, I wish to take up a number of points raised by Deputy Fleming. I agree with his comments in relation to the budget, particularly in terms of the view he expressed about county managers being solely responsible for capital programmes and also for deciding how development levies and proceeds from the sale of lands are spent in council areas. I will support the Deputy's attempt to have this amended on Committee Stage because, in light of the millions of pounds spent by local authorities each year, the only people accountable to the public every five years will be the elected members. It is vital that they be given a say in respect of the operation of the capital and revenue programmes of councils.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that managers will be obliged to submit reports on capital programmes for three years with draft budgets. They will also be able to submit periodic reports which may specify an authority's financial position. That will only be effective if the council has a say and real clout in how the money will be spent. There can be reports galore, but the democratically elected members need to have the clout to make proposals and changes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact a local authority will have the power to establish an audit committee when it receives the audit report. We have seen the effectiveness at national level of the Committee <Col N="343" /> of Public Accounts in monitoring how money is spent in the public interest. I welcome the potential for these mini-committees of public accounts to operate at local authority level. It is important local authority members are satisfied the vast funding available to the authorities is spent in the best possible way and that they can justify how it is spent to the electorate to whom they will be answerable every five years.</P>
    <P>In Part XIV the manager is responsible for the effective and efficient operation of the local authority for ensuring implementation without undue delay of decisions of the elected council. This has been a matter of great concern to me over the past 12 months in that I find county councils do not have sufficient staff nor are they paying those they have well enough, especially in areas such as engineering and planning, to enable them fulfil that specific task. If properly trained staff are not in place to implement decisions taken by the county council, it becomes ineffective. The salary structure for these professionals in local authorities needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House. This is brave and innovative legislation the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has put forward.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, well. I understand he is sick at present.</P>
      <P>When the issue of the Bill was first raised in the House some two years ago, it was felt it was among the most important legislation with which the House would deal. Unfortunately, we became caught up in one item, namely, the dual mandate, and we have been hedging, talking and negotiating since. It has taken much of the gloss from the Bill which is of major importance to local government and the service provided at local level to people.</P>
      <P>I can understand the case made for the dual mandate in that a Member of the Oireachtas would also want to be a member of the local authority in his or her area. As a member of Kildare County Council and Athy Urban District Council, I see the value in that. One can see on a daily basis the value of the service delivered to local people by the local authority system.</P>
      <P>In debating that system, one word which comes up is service and it is not being provided. Local authorities have many ambitions and many reports have been compiled about them. Taking into account all the reports compiled about them, they have probably been the most discussed topic within the term of office of any Government. Despite that, we still have major problems providing the services the people richly deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to be serious about the development of local authorities and delivering the necessary <Col N="344" /> services, be they housing, water and sewerage or roads, the proper support needs to be in place not only to provide services but to allow councillors do their work. It is of great concern to me that we continue to develop local authorities without putting in place any structure to support the member who is under greater pressure now than he was 15 or 20 years ago. Nowadays we are on strategic policy committees and other committees within the structure of local authorities. We are expected to deliver reports, attend meetings on a regular basis, table motions for council meetings, examine estimates and deliver services without the necessary support to provide them.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about local authorities, a staffing system should be put in place to assist the local authority member to fulfil his or her duties. That is not the case at present. We do not have facilities. To my knowledge no local authority has proper rooms where a member can go to do some work, even such as typing a letter. No such rooms exist which would assist local authority members to provide the service to people in their areas. That is the basic necessary commitment and I do not see it anywhere in the Bill. There is nothing which states that we will care and provide for local authority members who find it becoming increasingly difficult to carry out their functions.</P>
    <P>As regards planning, my local authority in Kildare should have 15 planners but instead has six. One can imagine the pressure that places on the authority and on the people in the planning section. One can imagine the frustration members of the local authority endure. The authority supplies planning services to Naas and Athy UDCs. It is not possible to do that under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister if it was possible for local authorities to hire people to train them to be planners within the system. I received a negative reply from him stating that, in two years' time, another 75 planners will be available from the universities and that should meet demand. That means, however, that, in the interim, there will be major problems within the system in Kildare because there are not enough planners to meet the demand of one of the fastest developing counties in Ireland. This development is because of the county's proximity to Dublin and the area is rapidly becoming part of the greater Dublin area. Despite this, the planning section in the county council is in disarray because we cannot employ enough planners nor can we seem to employ them on a permanent basis. This causes major problems with development plans.</P>
    <P>These plans are behind schedule in Kildare, despite the fact we have as committed staff as one could have. The problem is we do not have enough of them to meet demand. Interviews were held recently to hire more staff, but I understand they will not be employed until September. The problem still exists and is growing because the proper staffing levels are not in place.</P>
    <P>This is what is wrong with local authorities. We have not given sufficient impetus to them to <Col N="345" /> match private investment. When a good planner or engineer is hired, he or she is identified by private interests, sounded out to identify his or her qualities and then head hunted. He or she moves on and the local authority is at a loss. We must invest in local authority staff if we are to provide a service to match the demands of local government.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on a number of occasions about urban district councils and town commissioners. The town of Newbridge, with a population of 20,000, has a town commission. It should be given its rightful place in local government by the provision of an urban district council which would give it its own housing and planning authority. There are 600 people on the housing list in Newbridge, yet the town depends for housing and planning services on Kildare County Council. We must recognise the extent of development and population growth in many towns and give them a new impetus and the right to make decisions within their own areas. In north Kildare the towns of Leixlip, Celbridge, Maynooth and Kilcock are areas of high population density but they have no impetus to provide the structures which would encourage public responsibility because the centre of responsibility for them is removed from the focus of the townspeople. We are allowing satellite towns to develop with no focus or community involvement. The Bill speaks of town councils but contains nothing positive in this regard. I hope the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, will look again at the provision of urban councils with housing and planning authority for these towns. This would be of major significance in their development. The centre of decision making would not be removed to the county authority as is now the case in County Kildare.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring has spoken of the right of the people to decide who will be their local government or Dáil representatives. The party leaders have expressed their view on the question of the dual mandate. However, in many cases their supporters have been elected to this House because of the work they have done on local authorities. Party leaders might not be so anxious to remove the dual mandate if they reflected on this. I am happy the dual mandate is to remain and that the right to elect their representatives is to remain with the people. It is still within the remit of the people to decide if a person will represent them on an urban or county council or in Dáil Éireann. This may be one of the lessons we learned from last Thursday's vote on the Nice Treaty.</P>
    <P>Because of the way it has been handled I am sure many Deputies will want to contribute to the debate on this Bill. We will hear a wider range of Deputies' views during the debate on Committee Stage. I hope we do not have such time constraints then as we have today.</P>

There has been a clamour <Col N="346" /> from Deputies who are not even members of local authorities to speak on a matter, of which they have no working knowledge.

      <P>I agree with Deputy Wall with regard to the dual mandate for membership of local authorities and Dáil Éireann. The Bill has been signalled for the past two years. It is regrettable that we now find our discussion of it constrained by time. The Bill contains 241 sections but where are the reforms? Reform of the dual mandate was the trumpet which heralded the Bill.</P>

      <P>The proposal has now been dropped and I am delighted. I am a member of a local authority and I am proud of that fact. When the fig leaf of dual mandate reform is removed the Bill is seen to contain nothing of substance. Where is the reform? What was all the talk about? The only reform proposed was the banning of the dual mandate. Now that that has been abandoned the Bill is a damp squib. There is no reform.</P>
      <P>Titles are to be changed. We are to have executive directors and directors of services. I have never heard such nonsense. The same people will be dressed up in different uniforms wearing different hats but doing the same jobs. These people should have been left as they are. Our planning engineer is now a director of services, God bless the mark.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of a local authority for the past 27 years and recently a member of an urban council. I am very proud of this. Local government is the coalface of democracy. It is where we learn the problems of the people. The people who elect us to local authorities are the people who know us. If they place their trust in us that is an indication of our ability to represent them. We are then entitled to go on to Dáil Éireann to air the views expressed at county council meetings on a weekly basis. Excellent discussions are heard at local authority meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some members of local authorities have a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude to local authority officials. This is not helpful. Members of local authorities should work with the executive. They are professional people who know their job. I am proud of the rapid strides my county has made in the past decade. We have one of the most outstanding county managers in the country, Mr. Brian Johnston. He has a marvellous executive team around him. We have made strides because we have a team of officials who know their jobs and elected members who work with the authority while being prepared to put their views forward <Col N="347" /> and have reasonable discussions. That will not change, nor do I want it to.</P>
    <P>The 241 sections in this Bill are a waste of time. Local government wants more finance but this is not signalled in the Bill. Local authorities are being starved of finance. The Government does not realise this.</P>

      <P>I used be laughed at when I spoke about money for roads. I might as well have been speaking to people on the street. However, when we got real money the job was done.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the dual mandate proposal has been dropped. It was a fig-leaf from the start and there is no reform behind it. I am proud to be a member of a local authority and I will remain there until the people, not the Minister, decide otherwise. I wish the Minister well.

      <P>I am mindful of Deputy Boylan's injunction that Deputies who are not local authority members should not be allowed to contribute to the debate. I find that rather odd. This is the national Parliament and such matters should be debated here. Fortunately or otherwise, depending upon how one looks at it, I am one of those people who came directly into the Dáil without the almost vital rite of passage through a local authority. Having said that, however, I am as entitled as anybody else, including Deputy Boylan, to make known my own <Col N="348" /> views, both on the dual mandate and on the vexed issue of local government reform. Every Member of the House is entitled to express an opinion on that. It is unfortunate, in a sense, that I was not given the opportunity to serve at local authority level before I entered this House. I had a great deal of learning to do and I continue to make great strides in trying to understand the intricate details of the workings of local authorities. As a constituency TD, I am certainly at a disadvantage in not having a full understanding of how the detail of the local authority system works. I do not believe, however, that there is any compelling case to be made for a Member of this House to be also a member of a local authority.</P>
      <P>In my maiden speech to the House, I made it clear that I approved of the abolition of the dual mandate. I am an abolitionist in that sense and I fully support the Minister, Deputy Dempsey's, efforts in this. He is right and the principle is correct. The principle has not been destroyed by this debate or by the Bill. The issue will be revisited in time, perhaps under another Government after another general election. It would be only right for the dual mandate issue to be revisited for the proper development of local democracy and local authorities generally.</P>
      <P>The dual mandate is wrong and I challenge those who operate under it to reassure me and the voting public that they can do both jobs well. Given the serious reform the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has inaugurated in this Bill, and the reforms that have preceded this legislation, I do not believe one can do both jobs well. If one is serving in this House three days a week, one will inevitably miss local authority meetings of one sort or another, be they full plenary sessions or vital committee meetings where the new special policy committees will be in action, including business and community interests that are now an integrated part of the local authority system.</P>
      <P>One cannot do both jobs well. A person would fail his constituents in trying to do both jobs. I understand the vulnerability of my colleagues and Opposition Members who feel that if they were removed from a local authority they would not have a relevance locally and may lose out electorally. That vulnerability arises from a low sense of confidence among people who operate under the dual mandate. TDs can do well for their constituents without necessarily being on a local authority and as time goes on that will become more apparent. Unfortunately, however, because of all sorts of political and other factors &ndash; both within my own party and among the Independent Deputies &ndash; we will not get rid of the dual mandate for now. I hope that matter will be dealt with in the future and we will arrive at a situation whereby we can pay local authority members properly for the vital work they do. Their work often goes unrecognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is often thought that a Dáil election is a more difficult contest than a local election but I would be the first to admit that I would not like to fight a local election. I consider it a far more difficult <Col N="349" /> a contest than a Dáil election because a huge proportion of the voters one meets on the doorsteps do not go out to vote. It is difficult also because it is more local in nature and it is hard for new candidates to launch themselves.</P>
    <P>To state, as Deputy Boylan did, that the Bill contains nothing, now that the abolition of the dual mandate is no longer to be a part of it, is simply not the case. There are wider reforms in the Bill which will have a lasting value for the development of local government. One such reform provides for the election of local mayors and another concerns the special policy committees that will allow all the social forces in a local authority area to play their part in the system of government in a given county. Other reforms will work in the long run.</P>
    <P>As regards the dual mandate, the Minister should proceed with his idea of allowing TDs who are not county councillors to have rights of access to information and reports from the local authority. In some local authorities TDs are well served in that regard, even if they are not members of the authority, but in others they are not so well served. The system should be even-handed. It might be helpful in weaning people off the idea of the dual mandate if TDs were given rights of access and representation to be able to attend some local authority meetings and speak in limited circumstances. I hope the Minister will go ahead with those ideas irrespective of the dual mandate. I know it will not go down terribly well with councillors who would feel the TDs were crowding their ground but the Minister now has an opportunity to push ahead with the idea of giving TDs and Senators rights of access to local councils, their officials and the reports they produce.</P>
    <P>There is a more important reform issue which is not contained in the Bill but which should be contained in future local government legislation. It applies not just to local government but to the entire State sector. We need an Ombudsman or advocate system on behalf of the public, the constituents, who come to us every day about matters relating to local authorities or social services on a national level. We need such an advocate system which could take a customer-focused approach in championing and vindicating people's rights. So often one finds in politics that people have approached a State office yet they have not found a response apart from a formulaic letter which does not satisfy them when they feel their entitlements have been transgressed.</P>
    <P>The delivery of our social services, both locally and nationally, but particularly locally, would be delivered in a better way if we had an advocate-type system in place in every local authority. In that way customers could arrive at a State office if they felt they were not receiving their due entitlements. Somebody could be employed &ndash; but not under the management of the local authority &ndash; to vindicate their rights in much the same way as the Ombudsman does concerning other State services. This could be a vital addition to <Col N="350" /> the operation of local authorities. It would also inspire more confidence in local bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>The issue of directly elected mayors has become a vexed one. I am not entirely happy with what the Minister has done in imposing a restriction of five years' experience in a local authority before one can qualify to become a directly elected mayor. That provision may be open to future constitutional challenge. Is it possible to discriminate between incumbent local authority members and ordinary citizens who may wish to put themselves forward for a position as a directly elected mayor? I would question the validity and long-term usefulness of restricting the qualification of those who wish to run for the office of mayor to those who have experience as an incumbent of a local authority. That argument may run counter to the interests of incumbent local authority councillors but, nonetheless, we are better off with a fully open and transparent system where anybody, no matter who they are, can put his or her name up for election. I suspect the reason for its inclusion in the Bill relates to what I might call the &ldquo;Dana factor&rdquo;. Let us be honest, there was a certain apprehension among the political class about the arrival of one Dana Rosemary Scallon on the political scene for the European Parliament elections. There was apprehension about the idea that independents, or single issue candidates of one kind or another with ordinary and very extraordinary views, could somehow be elected. At the end of the day, despite the contribution made by single issue candidates, which is often negative, democracy is democracy and it is open to everyone, once they reach the minimum age qualification, to put their names forward for election.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried, in difficult circumstances, to engage in the business of serious reform and this legislation is but one incremental change in the process. It will not lead to an overnight revolution but in the long run if local government is to be reformed in a serious manner, more payments must be provided for councillors for their hard work. The issue of devolving responsibility for budgets and social services to local authorities also needs to be examined. That is where real accountability will be provided.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister for the Environment and Local Government well. This debate is timely. The Bill has been awaited for a long time and I am most disappointed that the issue of the dual mandate is the only aspect of the legislation which has concentrated the minds of all the political parties and political commentators because there are many positive provisions in it which have gone unnoticed. I intend to highlight these on Committee Stage due to the lack of time available to discuss them in-depth now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully endorse direct elections of mayors as it is a positive step. There has been a democratic deficit at local government level for some time. Under the structure of local government since its <Col N="351" /> inception in the 19th century unelected officials have had all the powers. It is time to address this deficiency and shift the balance of power to allow local authority candidates to outline policies during elections and get involved in the strategic policy committees once they are elected to discuss these policies, which could then be implemented by the elected representatives as opposed to always having to depend on city and county managers to bring forward proposals which are discussed <i>ad nauseum </i>by local authority members but ultimately implemented by the managers. If we are serious about providing for directly elected mayors, it is imperative that they should be given stronger powers during the transition phase. Initially, the local government system could be upset if the powers are transferred automatically during a mayor's first term but a continual shift of power over a number of years from the local authority manager to the mayor should be examined.</P>
    <P>The restrictions on mayoral elections have been mentioned and I also agree that everybody should be entitled to put their name forward for election. We should be able to trust the public to decide who they want to represent them at city or county council level for five years. If single issue candidates come forward, whether the issue is of national or local importance, it means the previous set of councillors were not addressing something that they should have. If there is a strong feeling among the public regarding an issue, a breakdown in accountability and democracy at local government level is highlighted. This issue should be revisited. Many councillors are concerned that they will not have an opportunity to become mayors. However, they can go through their party's system or stand as independents and let the people be the final arbiters of who will represent them as mayor for a five year term.</P>
    <P>We can undertake all the local government reform we wish but the key factor is funding. As time passes, we should examine the development of a system which would allow local authorities to raise their own funds. Both Cork Corporation and Cork County Council, for example, apply service charges. If local authorities are willing to put their heads on the block and vote through charges on the public, a system should be in place to reward them. A penalty system was in place for many years whereby local authorities which raised their own funds were penalised by central government by not getting their fair share of the national cake because these funds were taken into account.</P>
    <P>If local authorities are prepared to levy charges, an incentive should be provided by the Government and funding increased for the councils involved in order that if members are willing to pass service charges, the public will see tangible evidence of local taxes being spent in their communities on library services and so on. There is no difficulty explaining to the public the reason funds must be raised locally if the local authority <Col N="352" /> is rewarded by central government and amenities and services are provided on the ground.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of the one-stop-shop. Local government, similar to central government, is sometimes out of touch with what is happening in the everyday lives of ordinary people. A previous speaker referred to a constituent who had to undertake a round trip of 140 miles to tax his car. That is completely unacceptable. Every large town should have a one-stop-shop where the services of all State agencies, including local authorities and health boards, are available to citizens. In this day and age it should be straightforward to provide all these services in a one-stop-shop. I acknowledge the scheme will be established on a pilot basis but as the shops are established, they will become a hub for citizens to access the services of local government and various State agencies.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about the issue of managers and officials in local authorities. I have not had a bad experience with officials as Cork Corporation is probably one of the more dynamic local authorities and an excellent new city manager has been appointed. In the past the local authority official who had the most impact on the lives of citizens was the manager because he or she decided policy. It was almost impossible to remove a manager who was inefficient, incapable or not up to the job and the local authority was stuck with that person. A mechanism should be in place to provide accountability in this regard.</P>
    <P>Cases involving bad local authority engineers are often raised. It is evident as one drives around the country that when one travels from one engineer's division to another there is a tangible difference in the quality of road surfaces, hedgerows and various maintenance works. This is down to one official who is not performing his or her role well. There is no system in place to remove these officials from their duties. This issue must be examined. It is fine to say all local authority officials and civil servants are effective but it is obvious that some are not. As in any other walk of life, some people are not up to the task they are expected to perform.</P>
    <P>The issue of capital programmes should also be examined. If accountability is to be ensured, local authority members must be allowed to make a significant input into such programmes. Members currently vote on estimates, development plans, the sale of lands but do not vote on capital programmes. Local authority members should have more of an input into budgetary decisions. We expect the public to elect councillors who will sit on a local authority for five years but do not trust them enough to have a serious input into the financial arrangements of their authority and how moneys are expended. This issue must be addressed. Cork Corporation has come a long way and members are often consulted on issues. When proposals from committees are put before the corporation the managers take the views of members on board. Funds have been set aside for <Col N="353" /> traffic calming and so on about which I feel strongly.</P>

      <P>The guillotine has dropped even sooner. I will do my best to share my time with Deputy Ulick Burke.</P>
      <P>When drafting my remarks on this Bill last night, I intended to say that we were debating in the dark with a guillotine hanging over us. However, last night the Government turned on the light and what we saw was not a pretty sight. There is nothing elegant about a political U-turn, even one that was this long coming. This was an inadequate Bill to start with, but with one of its principal innovations now gone, the ending of the dual mandate, it is as forlorn a piece of legislation as was ever placed before the Dáil. This long promised Bill was finally published on 4 May 2000, but it only came before the Dáil on 8 March this year. It was adjourned and is now back over a year since its publication.</P>
      <P>The fate of the Bill was the subject of widespread rumour and speculation centred on those Independent Deputies who support the Government but did not support the proposal in the Bill as published to end the dual mandate and disqualify Deputies and Senators from election to local authorities. It was a long year of negotiations between the Government and the Deputies in question and, more importantly perhaps, the Government's backbenchers. I assured the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, that I would support the ending of the dual mandate. He stated he did not have any intention of backing down on the issue. However, the entire Cabinet has now backed down. This is a legislative farce. I understand the Minister is unwell and wish him a speedy recovery. However, the Cabinet is clearly suffering from some form of viral infection and, regrettably, there is no immediately available antibiotic for Jackie Healy-Raeitis. The Cabinet's U-turn was forced not only by the four Independent Deputies who support the Government but also by many Fianna Fáil backbenchers whose grumbling against this measure was less audible, but no less ominous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having waited so long for the Bill we now find ourselves debating it with a guillotine hanging over us. This is a ridiculous way to conduct the <Col N="354" /> business of the Dáil on any matter, let alone a Bill which deals with local government, an issue which goes to the heart of democracy. The Second Stage debate on this long, varied and detailed Bill has been restricted to less than a week and many Deputies have clearly not had the opportunity to speak. Given the long wait for publication of the Bill and the undue delay in bringing it before the House, this guillotine is totally unacceptable. As a member of the Select Committee on Environment and Local Government, I protest also at a similarly restricted time for Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>I am totally dissatisfied with the situation in relation to this Bill. On this occasion, as on many others, the Minister has proved to be a total failure. He now lacks credibility because of his failure to defend the Bill he introduced in the Chamber. He has failed to challenge the four Independents who oppose it. It is sad that the four people responsible for this U-turn by the Minister have not appeared in the House to defend their actions. They would prefer to give the media a television sound bite on the plinth. If that is the way the Minister has yielded on this occasion, we deserve what we get as regards local government policy.</P>
      <P>The Bill emphasises that elected councils can determine policy and sets out an updated range of mechanisms for its implementation. However, the reality is different from what is stated in the Bill. The role of elected members is nothing more than to rubber stamp decisions. I have been a member of a local authority since 1974 and every year estimates are presented to us. Elected members have the capacity to change approximately 3% of the total expenditure of the local authority. It is futile for us to pretend otherwise. We saw what the Minister did recently in terms of waste management, where he failed miserably. A waste management policy was introduced by him. However, he denied the elected members of various councils the opportunity to have an input into devising a waste management policy. He will now force that policy on them. That is not local government and regrettable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to be here today to conclude the Second Stage of the debate on the Local Government Bill, 2000, which marks another milestone in the Government's ongoing programme for the renewal of our local government system. The diverse and wide-ranging contributions during the debate by Members of the House reflect the importance of local government in our society and show how it impacts in a real way on the daily lives of each one of us. Among the range <Col N="355" /> of issues referred to in the debate were funding, customer service, dual mandate, staffing, co-options, roads, planning, housing, new committee structures, salary for members, management and the need to enhance the role of council, community development, cathaoirleach, titles, meetings, the ombudsman, waste disposal and accounts. This gives a flavour of local government today. It also highlights that local government is integral to our continued economic and social development at all levels, both locally and nationally.</P>
    <P>Everyone agrees there is a need for the renewal of local government and the Government's renewal programme aims to move forward in a progressive way to deliver on this objective in a realistic and practical manner. The critical aims of the renewal programme are to strengthen local democracy, particularly through an enhanced role for elected members; to provide proper resources; to develop partnership with sectoral interests and local communities; to improve customer service and to develop efficiencies in local government. Since taking up office the Government has embarked on a major programme of action to achieve these objectives. After decades of reports, studies, analysis and rhetoric on the matter, we are now seeing real actions delivering tangible results. These actions are making a difference and visible not only to those operating within the local government system but also to the communities which local government serves.</P>
    <P>What has been achieved in the past four years? A brief snapshot shows that local government is now constitutionally recognised with a fixed electoral cycle and guaranteed local elections and a constitutional provision which provides the cornerstone for the Bill. A proper local government funding system is in place, which is now delivering more than 63% general purpose funding to local authorities, over and above the 1997 figures, and underpinned by modern financial management systems. County and city development boards are up and running and crucially under the democratic leadership of local government. This brings together for the first time at local level the State agencies, local development and social partners in planning for the future.</P>
    <P>There is a wide agenda to improve customer service by way of the one-stop-shop programme, better corporate planning, customer action plans and service indicators, special funding for service improvement and innovation as well as information technology and upgraded audit and VFM systems. Local authorities are key players under the national development plan in providing housing, water, roads, waste and other infrastructure necessary to sustain our continued social and economic progress and with funding at record levels. With proper back-up and directors of service now in place strategic policy committees are beginning to operate as intended, allowing members to develop a central role in policy development together with comprehensive train<Col N="356" /> ing and information programmes which are well under way for elected members.</P>
    <P>The implementation of modern human resources policies through new management structures in local authorities will strengthen management and staffing capacity and provide clearer accountability and responsibility, as well as opening up better career prospects in local government. Last but not least, is the Local Government Bill which provides the framework within which this programme of action will be carried forward, as well as providing a modern and consolidated code of local government law following from constitutional recognition and repealing enactments dating back almost two centuries.</P>
    <P>The local government Bill now before the House is one element of the overall package and must not be considered in isolation or as an end in itself, but rather as an important component of the overall programme. I hope the Bill will be viewed within this wider context as an element in a much broader programme of action, a package of measures designed to encompass the diverse functions of local government as well as the large number and range of authorities. We must consider those involved in the process, 1,600 councillors, 30,000 staff and most importantly the people from whom local government draws its mandate.</P>
    <P>The Bill will underpin the range of initiatives I have already outlined and aims to enhance the role of the elected members and place them at the heart of local democracy. As the Minister has indicated previously, he has approached the task of renewing local government as a realist in the light of practical experience and knowledge as a former councillor.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been criticised by some opposition spokespersons because it is not radical enough. However, the time has come to separate the theory from the reality. In a somewhat abstract sense there have been calls for radical change in local government, but at a practical level the Minister has not sensed any appetite for radical change. The reaction of some to the dual mandate provision and to the directly elected cathaoirleach would seem to bear this out. Nor have I heard any serious calls to redraw the map of local government as we know it. Quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>We might also recall that the actions of Opposition parties when in Government did not deliver the widespread removal of functions from other agencies, which they now loudly proclaim, and their transfer to local government. Fine Gael delivered nothing to local government other than dog licensing. Contrast that with the first experiment ever in this State to provide a lead role for local government through the county and city development boards, in bringing together at local level the State agencies, local development bodies and social partners to formulate and oversee implementation of an agreed strategy for the economic, social and cultural development of each county and city. This is a practical and innovative step forward as opposed to empty <Col N="357" /> rhetoric. The Minister is satisfied the Bill provides a framework to facilitate change in a manner which will allow the people involved to take ownership of the process. This is the key to success. It will allow local government to evolve in new directions and facilitate progressive change. The Minister will bring forward amendments on committee stage largely to take account of suggestions by the local authority associations and other interests; and to reflect other legislation such as the planning and development Act, enacted subsequent to publication of the Bill. As announced last evening, the Minister will also bring to Government, for consideration at its meeting next Tuesday, an amendment to remove the proposed bar on the dual mandate.</P>

      <P>We will shortly have an opportunity to debate the detailed provisions of the Bill on Committee Stage so I will confine my comments today to one or two particular issues. Many provisions in the Bill are geared towards enhancing the position of the elected members by allowing them to exercise their rightful role as policy makers. The corporate policy group, or CPG, headed by, and working in conjunction with the directly elected cathaoirleach, will provide a powerful impetus for change in the internal dynamics of local government, overseeing the executive arm and thus addressing the democratic deficit which has arisen over the years. The CPG will have a key role in the preparation of the corporate plan for the life of the council and the annual budget, both of which must be prepared by the manager in consultation with the CPG. The Bill provides for a range of powers for the CPG and the elected council to develop, make and steer policy and oversee the executive.</P>
      <P>At this stage, an executive role is not proposed for the CPG or cathaoirleach. However, it is worth mentioning that the recent report on local government in Ireland carried out on behalf of the Council of Europe's, Congress of Local and Regional Authorities commented on the potential for the CPG to evolve into a more executive type board over time. We will consider future developments in this direction in the light of experience gained in the operation of the new arrangements as now provided for in the Bill; and of the developing programme of local government renewal generally. In other words we must walk before we run. The Bill provides the opportunities for local government to engage with local communities and for the CPG with an elected cathaoirleach to occupy a central role both within the system and in bringing together for the common good the various local interests and agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> Members also need practical supports in order to carry out their role and maximise their contribution. The comprehensive training and education programme for all councillors, now well advanced, is one such support. In addition, the Bill provides for a salary-type payment and the introduction of pension arrangements for elected members for the first time ever in the history of local government in Ireland. I know this provision has wholehearted support across the political spectrum.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that local government in Ireland is facing huge challenges, higher expectations and greater accountability than ever before. The Government's renewal programme aims to equip it to perform efficiently and effectively in this changing environment. To do this, however, the local government system needs a modern legal framework, and this is the first time since the foundation of the State that any Government has brought forward such legislation. The Bill acknowledges the need for change and provides a practical framework for local <Col N="360" /> government to reshape its operations with full involvement of members, staff and local communities in a more participative and representative democracy. It provides a new ethics code to uphold high standards of integrity and transparency &ndash; standards which unfortunately have been damaged by the actions of a very small few.</P>
    <P>Few will disagree with me that this legislation is long overdue and that successive Governments down through the years must share responsibility for this. That being said I am happy to acknowledge previous work such as the publication of <i>Better Local Government</i> in 1996. However over the past four years the Minister has delivered real progress across a wide agenda of change. The Bill is the next step and I look forward to its more detailed consideration in the coming weeks.</P>

      <Quest>the basis on which exclusive rights to mussel fishing on Lough Foyle have been granted to a small number of operators, notwithstanding the fact that the transfer of mussel seed to the lough was publicly funded; the access other operators can claim to that mussel fishery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>No operators have been granted any rights to farm mussels or any other species in Lough Foyle to date because the necessary legalisation to enable aquaculture operations to be managed and controlled under licence is not in place. Under the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, responsibility for the development and licensing of aquaculture in Lough Foyle was conferred on the Foyle Carlingford Irish Lights Commission, one of the six North-South implementation bodies established under that Act.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Agreement Act provided that the necessary legislation to enable the FCILC to carry out functions regarding aquaculture would be brought forward in both jurisdictions. This draft legislation is being finalised by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland, with a view to publication later this year.</P>
      <P>In the absence of a legislative framework for aquaculture in the lough, public funding has not been made available to operators to support the development of commercial operations. However, in 1998 BIM made payments to operators for the relaying of mussels throughout Lough Foyle to enable a scientific survey to be undertaken, aimed at determining the mussel growing potential of the lough. At the time all operators were entitled to participate in the survey and it was also made clear that receipt of public funding did not confer any rights whatsoever in relation to any area where mussels were relayed.</P>
      <P>When the necessary statutory provisions are in place, which will entail parallel legislation being enacted in the Oireachtas and in the Northern Ireland Assembly, it will then be a matter for the FCILC to determine who will be awarded aquaculture licences in Lough Foyle. Any parties aggrieved by decisions of the FCILC will have a right of appeal to an independent aquaculture licence appeals tribunal, the establishment of which is also being provided for in the proposed new legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Minister of State's reply that participation in the seeding operation will not carry any right, or any claim to a right, to a licence? Does the Minister of State agree that the draft legislation to which he referred is long overdue? What provisions are being contemplated or put into force to allow the <Col N="363" /> normal continuation of existing aquaculture operations on the lough?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The harvesting of mussels and oysters will continue as heretofore. We do not have any right, by way of legislation, to enforce a particular system within the lough. There is a gentleman's agreement and natural justice applies.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of past arrangements, no rights will be granted to anyone. Each application for a licence will be considered on its merit and licences will be granted or refused on this basis. We are very anxious that this legislation will stand the test of time. Consequently, we do not wish to rush it but are progressing it as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now getting to the nub of the matter. The Minister of State said that mussel and oyster harvesting operations will continue &ldquo;as heretofore&rdquo;. What exactly does he mean by that in terms of who carries out these operations and the basis on which they are carried out? Will he inform the House what is involved in the gentleman's agreement to which he referred? What are its terms and on what are they based? While I understand the Minister of State's concern to ensure the legislation will stand the test of time, others are concerned to ensure that the gentleman's agreement, whatever it may be, will also stand the test of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>A gentleman's agreement is an agreement among all the operators within Lough Foyle. Some wild oysters were being cultured in the area and BIM was anxious to ascertain whether mussels could also be cultivated in the lough. That proved very successful. By and large, those who lay the mussels harvest them. Some people in the area traditionally lifted mussels and there are tensions in this regard. It is my intention through BIM and the Department to allay some of the operators' fears. I would like to see people in the lough working together. I hope to facilitate this, as has happened in other areas in which there were difficulties and tensions. That is my goal and I am sure the Deputy shares my view.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>if he favours a set-aside or buy-out of drift net or snap net salmon fishing; whether a definitive decision is required at this stage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have previously advised the House on the complexities inherent in promoting a complete voluntary buy-out or set-aside of the Irish commercial salmon sector. The Deputy will be aware that funding has been made available for two catchment based set-aside draft net schemes on a pilot basis and I have invited regional fisheries boards to make proposals to me.</P>
      <P>My Department has been working with the Southern Regional Fisheries Board on its proposal for a five year set-aside of commercial netting on the River Blackwater. It has not been possible to reach agreement for this season on this proposal because the actual take-up by commercial fishermen was proving too low and many of the active fishermen, in particular, were not on board. The SRFB will continue to explore with local interests the possibility of reaching an agreement for the 2002 commercial season.</P>
      <P>A number of interests are pressing for a national scheme to fund the complete cessation of commercial salmon fishing. Whether such a scheme would have the desired impact in conserving our salmon stocks and represent value for money is far from clear at this time. I have made the point that international experience on the removal of commercial wild salmon operations is mixed. There are instances in which stocks have not recovered despite the complete closure of the commercial operations. Furthermore, not all active commercial salmon fishermen are willing to be bought out. I have cautioned against the excessive raising of expectations about compensation and reiterate that simplistic solutions will not work.</P>
      <P>My objective is that all commercial salmon fishing is sustainable, proportionate and predicated on quality and I am considering all policy options for future direction in that context. I have asked my Department, in conjunction with the ongoing work of the National Salmon Commission on consideration and effort reduction, to analyse all appropriate strategies at our disposal, including incentivisation, fishing season restrictions, catch restrictions and licence reductions. The Department is assessing the practicalities, realism and benefit of different approaches to achieving the overall objective. The cost benefit of any strategy is a key consideration. My Department will liaise closely with the National Salmon Commission in finalising its assessment.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that due to a typographical error, the words &ldquo;draft net&rdquo; were omitted after &ldquo;drift net&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister outline the details of the pilot schemes? Have they been publicised? I am not aware of them and they would serve as a useful yardstick. Does the Minister intend to extend the pilot schemes to other locations throughout the country and, if so, when? What is the timeframe for the current schemes or will they run indefinitely?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the precise details of the schemes on the River Blackwater and the other river to hand but will forward them to the Deputy. Neither I nor the Minister of State can recall the other river involved in a set-aside scheme. Our intention is to identify common ground for set-aside or buy-out with commercial salmon draft net and drift net fishermen. This is quite a complex issue. Many fishermen do not wish to engage in a buy-out or set-aside while others have completely exorbitant expectations of the level of compensation.</P>
      <P>I have asked the National Salmon Commission which is representative of all the groups involved in this area to discuss the issue and bring forward proposals. Discussions have also been held with Orri Vigfusson who is anxious to see a complete buy-out of the commercial salmon sector. I pointed out to him that the situation which prevails in Ireland is not similar to that in other areas in which buy-outs have proved successful. It is not possible to make simple comparisons in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the lack of a concrete proposal from the Department to the fishermen concerned is causing difficulty? I am not aware of any such proposal. Some fishermen are dreaming up compensation figures running to telephone numbers. Until such time as the Department puts a solid proposal on the calculations for buy-out or set-aside to all sectors on a nationwide basis, we cannot get down to serious discussions on this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point. The National Salmon Commission was established to address these issues and identify common ground among the various sectors in the industry. I have had a number of discussions with various interests. It is a complex issue and not one where one can lay a plan on the table and expect everyone will agree to it. That will not happen. The National Salmon Commission is trying to come up with a formula to enable us to pursue the policies of set-aside and buy-out.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>if exceptions have been made to the application of the Merchant Shipping Register Regulations, 1997 (SI 294), particularly in relation to Paragraph 9.2(b) thereof; if so, when such exceptions were made; the reason in each case for making such an exception; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16973/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulation 9(2)(b) of the Merchant Shipping (Registry, Lettering and Numbering of Fishing Boats) Regulations, 1997, provides for the allocation to vessels of distinguishing letters and a number. This is part of the registration process. In practice, the allocation is made by the local registrar for a port of registry on receipt of an application for registration on the fishing boat <Col N="366" /> register of a vessel licensed under section 222B of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959. The distinguishing letters and number are allocated before the vessel is finally entered on the fishing boat register.</P>
      <P>In several cases it has not been possible to finally complete the registration process pending resolution of outstanding matters. Primarily, the delays have arisen because of unresolved issues under negotiation with the EU Commission. These relate to the overall capacity objectives of the Irish pelagic segment and outstanding applications for safety capacity credits. Issues to be finalised with some individual vessel owners in relation to delivery of replacement capacity have also contributed to delays in the final registration process. My Department is working to resolve these issues as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that when the identification letters and numbers are issued it is the presumption, and the accepted practice elsewhere, that the vessel already has a fishing licence? Why are there cases where that practice has not been followed? What is the reason that issue of identification letters and numbers has proceeded in advance of the issue of a fishing licence? Can the Minister tell us why there are unresolved issues with regard to the capacity of the pelagic segment in relation to safety capacity credits and replacement capacity? Why has it not been made clear that identification letters and numbers cannot be issued until all of those issues have been resolved and the fishing licences issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal practice is that registration is carried out before the boat is entered on the fishing boat register. It is not unusual for a long time to elapse before the boat is placed on the register due to a whole series of negotiations which normally take place. The difficulties causing the delay in the outstanding cases have to do with the overall capacity objectives of the Irish pelagic segment where we are clearly at over capacity in terms of the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EU Commission. There are also issues whereby boat sizes have been increased and there is discussion with the Commission and the owners involved as to the amount of safety tonnage that can be provided for that increase. We have an ongoing discussion with the owners and with the Commission and this is not abnormal. It happens in cases going back over the years. Negotiations are ongoing with both sides with a view to finalising the licences for those boats. In the meantime they are operating on temporary licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister began by saying the registration letters and numbers are issued, on application to the relevant authority, on the basis that the vessel is licensed as a fishing vessel. That is the clear intent of the regulations. They set out that a vessel to which a fishing licence has been <Col N="367" /> granted may be registered and issued with identification letters and numbers. If it is the case that a practice has grown up whereby these identification letters and numbers are issued in advance of the issue of a fishing licence, I put it to the Minister that it is a breach of the clear intent of the regulations. Does the Minister feel it is causing confusion and a good deal of suspicion that this can arise? What does he intend to do to bring the practice into conformity with the regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation is made by the local registrar for a port of registry on receipt of an application. The distinguishing letters and numbers are therefore allocated before the vessel is finally entered on to the fishing boat register. Negotiations then take place on the licence as that is normal practice. I am not aware that it is in breach of regulations but I will be happy to check it out. From the time I came into the Department, and for much longer before, that has been standard practice. I will clarify for the Deputy if departmental practice is outside the normal regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements for access by foreign fishing vessels to the six and 12 mile bands, the Irish Box and the Irish exclusive economic zone, are governed by EU legislation. There has been no change to the access arrangements since the establishment of the western waters effort regime in the mid-1990s. Access is one of the issues currently being considered in the context of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy. While some member states want to see the six and 12 mile limits removed and the Irish Box abandoned, I will continue to strongly oppose any <Col N="368" /> such moves. In addition to retaining the current access restriction I am concerned to ensure that in the review adequate protection is provided to coastal states to ensure that a sustainable balance is retained between fishing effort and resources in those waters. The work we initiated in the European Union in relation to stock recovery programmes will provide long-term benefits to fishermen by ensuring that young fish are not removed. It is through these initiatives and even-handed control and enforcement within the Common Fisheries Policy that the long-term interest of fishermen can best be protected.</P>
      <P>Our fisheries protection services are working to ensure that all vessels fishing in the Irish exclusive economic zone respect all relevant conservation measures. In the first four months of this year the Naval Service sighted 761 fishing vessels in Irish waters and boarded 437 of those vessels for the purposes of inspection. In total, half of all Irish vessels sighted were boarded and about two thirds of the non-Irish vessels were boarded. Efficient, even-handed fisheries control is vital to ensuring sustainable fisheries in our waters. I have stressed to Commissioner Fischler the need to ensure a level playing field in respect to effective fisheries control throughout the European Union and I will continue to raise this issue at every opportunity.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the new strategic plan for the development of forestry will entice more planting; the achievable targets for planting on an annual basis over the next five years; if his attention has been drawn to the anger of 12,000 forestry farmers who are refused top-up payments for land planted prior to 1999; his views on whether this decision will militate against the planting targets set out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The planting targets are set out in the 1996 strategic plan for forestry, Growing for the Future. The plan envisaged annual planting levels of up to 25,000 hectares up to the end of 2000 and 20,000 hectares thereafter.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, these ambitious targets have not been met in recent years because of a number of factors, including competition with agricultural schemes and premium levels. The shortfall in planting levels <i>vis-à-vis</i> targets and the need to get planting back to the target levels was reviewed in the context of the formulation of the rural development plan, 2000-06. It is envisaged that planting levels in the next few years will be of the following order: 2001, 16,000 hectares; 2002, 18,000 hectares; 2003, 20,000 hectares.</P>
      <P>As indicated, it is expected that the planting level of 20,000 will be reached in 2003. Significant funding of around £540 million has been provided for afforestation under the rural development plan. Last year I announced average increases of around 30% in both the grant and premium levels. This has had a positive impact in terms of planting in 2000. I have also secured agreement in principle on the inclusion of a mid-term review under the rural development plan. Given the combination of these factors, I am confident that planting levels will increase on an incremental basis.</P>
      <P>I also remind the Deputy of the revised framework in which forestry activities are undertaken. Last year my Department published a suite of environmental measures. These included an Irish forest standard, a code of best forest practice and five environmental guidelines. This is further evidence of my commitment to ensuring all forestry activities are carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable forest management.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>The Government's recently published national climate change strategy recognised the strategic importance of forestry and called for an intensification of the planting programme. On the issue of backdating of premiums for those who planted pre-2000, I have sought to secure increases for the people concerned. It was not possible, despite our every effort, to persuade the European Commission, which remained steadfast in its opposition. The possibility of the Exchequer bearing the full cost for such was considered. However, in view of other calls on the Exchequer, it is not possible for the Government to do so in the current year. I will continue to pursue this matter. I am confident that future prospects for the forestry sector are good, given the particular considerations to which I have already referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister of State a simple answer as to the reason there was a big dip in the acreage for planting this year. He knows it as well as I do. In fairness to him and <Col N="370" /> the Department, a useful range of financial grants have been made available for planting but is it reasonable to assume that the very year those came into operation there is a huge dip in the amount of land being made available for afforestation? I and many others believe farmers have lost confidence because of the way the Minister, the Minister of State and the Government have handled the commitment given to the 12,000 farmers who were told they would get retrospective payments for before 1999. No matter how one analyses the reasons the target has not been met, that is the main reason and it will be around for a long time.</P>

      <P>Two onshore licensing options are currently held by Priority Oil and Gas, an American-based company, over an area in the north west carboniferous basin. The licensed area comprises lands in Counties Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo and straddles the border with County Fermanagh. The company recently applied to my Department for approval to assign its entire interests in the options to Evergreen Resources Inc., which is also American based. The application is being processed by my Department.</P>
      <P>The options are due to expire at the end of this month. An option gives the holder first right to an exploration licence over the area. I understand that when the assignment of the options has been completed, Evergreen Resources intends to apply for an onshore exploration licence and, subject to approval, intend to drill at least one well in the near future. Evergreen Resources has indicated to my Department and recently announced its intention, as the Deputy may be aware, to drill up to five wells in the north west, four shallower wells in the North of Ireland and one deeper well in the Republic over the summer and early autumn.</P>
      <P>At this stage there are no definite proposals for the drilling of the onshore well. In the event of an application by Evergreen for an onshore exploration licence it will be necessary for the company to submit a proposed work programme, which would include the drilling of a well, for approval by my Department.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the report made to me prior to last December's budget by the advisory board to the Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO. The advisory board recognised the need to have in place a competitive package of attractions to make Ireland a centre for shipping and shipping services. Key components of a competitive package identified by the advisory board were a tonnage tax, a modernised ship registration system, an increased seafarer's income tax allowance, speedy development of a new national maritime college and provision for locally based ship financing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The IMDO's agenda for the creation of a competitive Irish shipping base has been significantly progressed. Last December's budget saw the special £5,000 seafarer's income tax allowance made more accessible by the reduction in the number of days a seafarer is required to be on a voyage to qualify for the allowance, which is now 161 days as against the previous 169 days. In addition, the 12.5% corporation tax regime for the shipping sector was brought forward from 2003 to 1 January 2001. Progress on undertaking the development of the new National Maritime College at Ringaskiddy, County Cork, as a public private partnership continues. It is planned that the college will be up and running by 2003. Discussions are ongoing between my Department and the Department of Finance in relation to the tonnage tax and seafarers income tax issues. The IMDO is also developing ship financing proposals which I am advised will be finalised shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IMDO has commissioned consultants to help with the preparation of new and up-to-date ship registration processes. In due course I intend to transfer registration functions for merchant <Col N="373" /> vessels &ndash; at present undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners and my Department's Mercantile Marine Office &ndash; to the IMDO.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that even the changes in the tax regime &ndash; he mentions the proposal for a tonnage tax and the change to the 12.5% tax &ndash; still leaves us at a disadvantage compared to other countries? Does he agree that in relation to the seafarers tax, the change that was made by reducing the voyage length from 169 days to 161 days is a meagre response to what was a much more comprehensive proposal? Can the Minister tell the House if consideration has been given to the other part of that proposal which was to increase the seafarers income tax allowance from £5,000 to £15,000? Can the Minister undertake to take any steps, or apply any pressure, towards getting that part of the recommendation implemented in the context of the forthcoming budget?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Minister for Finance, the Deputy will be well aware of the implications of increasing any segments of tax free allowances. That is the difficulty. I agree the change in the number of days, from 169 to 161, is a small improvement. I accept that we are still at a disadvantage, despite the improvement in the budget, compared to other countries who have tonnage taxes. It is my continuing objective to bring about improvements, and to introduce a tonnage tax which will make Ireland a more attractive place for ship registration. There is no doubt the IMDO has done a good job in identifying for my Department and the Government the potential that exists and the disadvantages that we are at. During this year, it will be my objective to bring about these improvements in association with the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The current licensing terms were very carefully designed and introduced in 1992 to compensate for Ireland's disadvantage in terms of perceived prospectivity and operating conditions and to encourage interest in exploration and <Col N="374" /> development. Since the introduction of the 1992 licensing terms, a total of 37 exploration licences have been granted, of which 26 were frontier exploration licences. Earlier this month, eight of the 11 frontier licences granted under the licensing round in 1997 were relinquished which means there are now only 13 offshore exploration licences in place at present compared to a peak of 32 in 1997. Out of the 37 licences granted since the 1992 terms were introduced, a total of 24 have been relinquished, including 15 of the frontier licences.</P>
      <P>Only three exploration wells have been drilled in the Irish offshore in the past 3 years, despite the existence of the 1992 terms. Irish prospectivity is low and is not comparable with our oil producing neighbours. We have only had three successful exploration wells out of 123 wells in 30 years. Over the same period the United Kingdom has drilled about 3,000 wells of which about 250 are in production.</P>
      <P>In light of these factors, it is premature to consider changing our terms but I intend to keep them under continuing review. Such a debate at this time is not justified by our record of prospectivity, and would send the wrong signals to the industry at a time when we need to encourage the industry to increase the level of exploration.</P>

      <P>A small number of people continually engage in a philosophical debate about this issue. I am blue in the face repeating Government policy. In addition to what I have said, there is no point in changing terms and applying a taxation regime to increase income for the State until we have an oil or gas province. We do not have that with just one successful well after 30 years of exploration. Our terms are continually kept under review. We do not intend to break any binding contracts we have made with companies. In the event of successful drilling programmes in the years to come, and in the event of finding an oil or gas province, at that point we would be justified in improving the terms so that we can increase the flow of taxation to the Exchequer.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware a thorough examination of the final report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into accident DH 248/rescue 111 Tramore, 2 July 1999 took place in my Department. The following is an update on the response of my Department to the recommendations which relate specifically to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. The recommendation 4.14 &ndash; safety recommendation 24 of 2000 &ndash; refers to the emergency services including fire service, regional airport fire crews, the Garda Síochána, IMES coas<Col N="376" /> tal teams, mountain rescue teams and RNLI lifeboat crews being made fully aware of and trained to deal with, the potential hazards to rescue personnel associated with sites of serious aircraft accidents. My Department has in place training programmes for coast guard units in dealing with hazardous situations. This training is being upgraded in the case of incidents of serious aircraft accidents. On 14 October 2000, the chief fire officer at Shannon Airport delivered a lecture on the subject of downed aircraft search and approach techniques at the coast guard area officers' annual conference in Limerick. I plan to have this lecture as a regular means of training personnel in relation to downed aircraft.</P>
      <P>Recommendation 4.15 &ndash; safety recommendation 25 of 2000 &ndash; recommends that a formal service level agreement be put in place between the Air Corps and the Irish coast guard defining the precise responsibilities and deliverables of both parties. My Department accepts the need for formalising current relationships and such agreements are at draft stage at present.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>All safety recommendations have been concluded by my Department with the exception of a service agreement between my Department and the Air Corps of the Department of Defence. This agreement awaits the outcome of the Department of Defence contract for helicopter procurement and the finalisation of the report of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources-Department of Defence working group on dedicated marine emergency response helicopters.</P>
      <P>Recommendation 4.16 &ndash; safety recommendation 26 of 2000 &ndash; states that for future SAR bases at airports-aerodromes, a service level agreement between the operator and the airport authorities should be put in place before operations are commenced. This should clearly identify the level of support services to be provided. My Department in its contract relationships with private operators ensures that appropriate agreements to the Department's satisfaction are in place between service providers and airport authorities. It should be noted that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is not a party to relationships between the Air Corps and airport authorities.</P>
      <P>Recommendation 4.21 &ndash; safety recommendation 31 of 2000 &ndash; recommends that my Department should review the aviation expertise and training requirements for personnel involved in the tasking of SAR air assets. My Department has an ongoing training and review programme in place which encompasses, <i>inter alia</i>, aviation awareness. Two three week search and rescue mission co-ordinator's courses have been attended by 12 staff to date and a two day aviation awareness module was introduced on the course.</P>

    <P>Recommendation 4.22 &ndash; safety recommendation 32 of 2000 &ndash; is that my Department should <Col N="377" /> conduct an investigation into the maritime circumstances, which gave rise to the mission and to prolonging the mission. The maritime circumstances that gave rise to the rescue mission are well known and documented. Unfortunately these type of circumstances are all too common despite continuing intensive media and publicity campaigns led by my Department assisted by the RNLI, Irish Water Safety, the Civil Defence, CII, and sporting, fishing and various representative organisations. The chief marine surveyor has advised that a formal investigation is not required as all the details are already available. The level of call out to assist leisure craft in difficulty is more than 300 annually. A key aim of my Department is to bring about a fundamental change in safety culture.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 4.25 &ndash; safety recommendation 35 of 2000 &ndash; states that the relevant operators should ensure that future new, or significantly changed, SAR operations, are the subject of a work-up period prior to the commencement of full operations. My Department has to be satisfied when taking on private contractors that they will be fully capable and proficient in providing the required service from date of contract. The relationship with the Air Corps is not a contractual one and the matter of proficiency of crews and assets is primarily for the military authorities.</P>

Will the office of the Ceann Comhairle issue an instruction to Departments not to produce lengthy answers for Ministers which take longer to read than the time allowed in the nósanna Oireachtis? The Minister has just read out a supplementary response, and we know how these briefs are prepared, that has taken longer to read than is allowed. There is another Minister &ndash; not the current Minister &ndash; with whom I dealt on another matter, who came in and gave us lectures that could have lasted all night. I suggest that the Leas Cheann-Comhairle gets the office of the Ceann Comhairle to issue a reminder <Col N="378" /> to Departments not to prepare these time-wasting tomes for Ministers.

      <P>In 1995 Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and partners were granted a frontier exploration licence over five and a half blocks in the Porcupine Basin.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply on 8 May last to Question No. 12748/01 on the matter. On that occasion I informed the House that I had received a document from the Irish Fishermen's Organisation entitled the &ldquo;Safety aspects of salmon fishing regulations&rdquo; and that it would be considered by my Department in consultation with the National Salmon Commission. This document calls for the introduction of safety days which are explained as extra days which would be allowed at the end of the drift net fishing season to compensate fishermen for days during June and July when fishing is not possible due to bad weather. The case made for the introduction of safety days is to remove the pressure on salmon fishermen to go out in adverse weather conditions. Other interests in the salmon resource take the view that this would in effect amount to an extension of the drift net fishing season and an increase in the level of commercial fishing effort.</P>
      <P>The current limitations on the drift net season were introduced as part of a range of vital measures in 1997 to conserve our vulnerable salmon stocks following the publication of the report of the Salmon Management Task Force in 1996. These measures, including the length of the commercial season, were put in place as part of a package of measures to address a serious decline in salmon stocks generally. As part of the package, the prohibition on the use of monofilament nets was lifted. As the Deputy will appreciate, this process of consideration of this proposal requires that all perspectives on the impact of the proposal must be taken into account, including, the views of other interests and the impact on existing conservation measures and on salmon stocks generally. It is unlikely that that this proposal would be acceptable to all interests except in the context of other fundamental changes in our salmon conservation strategies. I have therefore asked my Department to consider it further in the context of the current strategic analysis of future directives for the commercial salmon fishing sector which I signalled in my reply to Question No. 2 earlier today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give the impression that I favour drift net fishing, I am totally opposed to it in any form. The Irish Fishermen's Organisation made a submission, the question was asked on 8 May and the Minister replied to it. Is it not reasonable to assume that a sufficient period has elapsed to allow a decision, either favourable or unfavourable, to be made on that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that there are many interested parties involved, all of which <Col N="380" /> have to be contacted. He referred to drift net fishing and, living on the Hook Peninsula, I know drift net, draft net and snap net fishermen who all want to continue this tradition and obtain, by whatever means, the right to fish on a number of additional days. I am not suggesting that they are trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes, but even in the sunny south east there are days in June and July on which bad weather prevents fishing.</P>
      <P>We want to ensure this matter is put to rights. Salmon conservation measures are vitally important to the country, from many points of view, including that of the economy. In order to get it right we must consult will all interested parties. A target date has been set and we will, I hope, be able to arrive at a solution to the problem in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>the steps being taken to ensure Coillte Teoranta plants a greater proportion of broadleaf trees, having regard to the concerns expressed by environmental organisations regarding the impact of the level of conifer planting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17395/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding for the current afforestation programme is provided for in the CAP rural development plan, 2000-06, which was agreed following lengthy discussions with the European Commission. A significant feature of this plan is an increase in the target for broadleaf planting. This target, which was agreed with the European Commission, is for 30% of broadleaves by the end of 2006. The target for broadleaf planting up to and including 1999 was 20%, which we have already achieved.</P>
      <P>Last year's planting by Coillte was 1,464 hectares out of a total of 15,655 hectares planted. The main reason for this low level of planting by Coillte was the decision of the European Commission to regard Coillte as ineligible for forestry premium payments. It was not possible for Coillte in such circumstances to undertake large scale afforestation for economic reasons. Pending the conclusion of the legal action taken against the European Commission, Coillte is effectively precluded on the basis of commercial criteria from acquiring additional lands for the purpose of undertaking new planting.</P>
      <P>The broadleaf planting target is to be viewed on a national planting basis. On an individual site basis there is a 10% broadleaf requirement subject to soil and site suitability. Generally broadleaf species require better quality arable-type land which is not the situation for conifers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>The main consideration when planting is the suitability of the tree species to the site and soil conditions. Forestry inspectors from my Depart<Col N="381" /> ment include this in their operational recommendations on afforestation applications. It is Department policy that diversity of species should be introduced into all plantations where possible and broadleaves planted where suitable. It should be pointed out that all afforestation applications whether from Coillte or private applicants are subject to the same provisions. I understand concerns expressed by environmental organisations were addressed during the consultation stage of Coillte's certification by the Forest Stewardship Council, FSC. The announcement of this award was made last month. Certification is awarded in respect of the practice of sustainable forest management and covers the social, economic and ecological aspects of forestry.</P>
    <P>The practice of afforestation in Ireland is subject to the principles of sustainable forest management. These principles address the social, economic and ecological aspects of forestry. All afforestation projects are subject to compliance with the national forest standard and the code of best forest practice published in September 2000. In addition, compliance with a series of environmental guidelines is a condition of grant aid. The relevant guidelines are: forestry and water quality; forestry and biodiversity; forestry and archaeology; forestry and the landscape; forest harvesting and the environment. These were also published in September 2000.</P>
    <P>The national climate change strategy recognises the beneficial aspects of forestry, in particular in countering greenhouse gases and in its role as a carbon sequestrator. It is worth noting that conifers are particularly well suited in this regard. These species play a significant role as a carbon sequestrator. It is estimated that on average one hectare of Sitka spruce absorbs 3.3 tonnes of carbon per year while broadleaves absorb 1.3 tonnes. Over its rotation, one hectare of conifers will remove approximately 100 tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere, per hectare making them exceptionally efficient in combating the greenhouse gas effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no significant difference. With regard to Deputy Bell's question, it is obvious that timber can be produced more quickly from conifers than from broadleaves. Since farmers are business people, it is only to be expected that they would choose to plant conifers. We have to achieve our target in relation to broadleaf planting. Everyone likes broadleaf trees but conifers are extremely important <Col N="382" /> because they can remove far more carbon from the atmosphere than broadleaf trees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am again in the unfortunate position of having to draw the attention of the Minister and the House to yet another closure and a further major loss of jobs in County Wexford. Just over a month ago, the county was badly hit by the loss of 150 jobs at the Wexal factory in Enniscorthy. This week, my home town of Wexford is reeling from the announcement that the Wexford weaving factory is to close with a loss of 120 jobs.</P>
      <P>Both of these were long established traditional industries in County Wexford and the job losses resulting from their closure will have a considerable knock-on impact in the county. There have also been similar closures in other parts of the country and the underlying trend in the live register figures has, unfortunately, begun to creep upwards again. The Minister admitted in the House yesterday that job losses this year were likely to be 15,000 up on last year. This points to the fact boom can quickly turn to bust. At the very least we are witnessing a slowing down in the economy and urgent action on jobs is required. One of the key promises in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme for Government was the further encouragement of a home based industrial-manufacturing sector with export potential and balanced regional development. However, the Government has delivered on neither of these promises. The home based manufacturing sector is suffering a significant rate of attrition in terms of job losses and the Government has failed to honour its commitment to balanced regional development, as the experience of Wexford graphically illustrates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wexford has one of the lowest manufacturing bases in the entire country. Recent figures released by the Central Statistics Office reveal that it also has one of the lowest levels of <i>per capita</i> incomes in the State. The live register and labour force survey show that the south-east has not benefited from the economic boom to anything like the same extent as other areas. These are not just statistics, these are stories of human suffering, hardship and neglect. Despite the <Col N="384" /> shocking succession of job losses in Wexford, the Government is doing little or nothing to find replacement jobs or to attract new industries to County Wexford.</P>
    <P>The major employers in Wexford use traditional skills. This sector is under enormous pressure from international competitors and many of the jobs of those employed in it are vulnerable. As already stated, no effort is being made by the Government to support these jobs or attract new industries to the county. Reading through the list of new job announcements from the Minister, Deputy Harney, is a depressing experience if one happens to live in County Wexford, particularly if one's job is under threat or has recently vanished. Virtually every other part of the county seems to feature on the list. I do not begrudge other counties their good fortune, but I am convinced that Wexford is as entitled to its fair share as any other. The indisputable fact is that chronic industrial neglect has been visited upon Wexford since the Government took office. It is time those responsible for this neglect were called to account.</P>
    <P>Government policy has been reversed by four Independent Deputies. I call on not only the Minister to respond and take action but also those Members who sustain the Government in office to take a stand and put Wexford first. There should be no more reports, analyses, investigations or task forces. What Wexford must have is an immediate and substantive jobs announcement.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of the employment record in County Wexford. I thank the Minister for being present to respond to what we have to say.</P>
      <P>I raised the issue of Wexal in Enniscorthy on the Adjournment about three weeks ago. I pointed to the serious situation in my home town and throughout County Wexford. Little did I think at the time that Wexford Weaving would also be put out of business.</P>
      <P>There have been more than 300 job losses in the past three weeks in County Wexford, in addition to a number temporary lay-offs. As Deputy Howlin said, there are a number of industries in Wexford at present which are very shaky and need Government support.</P>
      <P>We have trotted out on numerous occasions the fact that the unemployment figures for Wexford are the worst in the country. This is recognised by the Minister. We have three times the national average unemployment rate. Some say we have twice but I contend we have three times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a mood of frustration, despair and anger in the county because thousands of jobs have been announced throughout the country in the past three years, yet Wexford has been bypassed. Why, might one ask? If there are hidden reasons we do not receive the job announcements and industry into County Wexford, perhaps we should be told. We have installed the <Col N="385" /> infrastructure, we are on the gateway to Europe, yet we are being left behind.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are a dead loss. They do not have any interest in County Wexford. We recently went as part of a delegation to meet Mr. Seán Dorgan and his team in Dublin. Deputy Howlin was present with others. We received soup and sandwiches and nothing else. It was a total negative as far as jobs in County Wexford were concerned.</P>

        <b>:</b> In all my years as part of deputations to IDA Ireland, and I have been part of many, I have never met such a negative bunch as Mr. Dorgan and his personnel on that occasion.</P>
      <P>We have advance factories proposed for New Ross and Enniscorthy, but these are being delayed by IDA Ireland because of bureaucratic nonsense. We have made every effort to try to have them built, and planning permission has been sought for one in Enniscorthy, but we receive no support from IDA Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister established the excellent enterprise initiative in Wexford in 1999 under the chairmanship of Séamus Dooley. As Deputy Howlin said, it has compiled reports and we have had the Bacon report outlining all the problems in Wexford and making a number of recommendations. However, nothing has happened with these reports.</P>
      <P>The time has come for action. We have had many reports; what we need now are jobs. Like Deputy Howlin, I represent the people of County Wexford, and they want their share of the job announcements from the Minister's Department. I call on her not to ask but to tell IDA Ireland's Mr. Dorgan and Enterprise Ireland's Mr. Flinter to give Wexford the priority it deserves. The gloves are off on this occasion and there is no going back. The fight is on and there is a mood of anger in County Wexford.</P>
      <P>Nothing will be accepted other than a few high-tech job announcements for the county in the coming weeks and months. It is no more than we in County Wexford and we as public representatives deserve. My party, Fianna Fáil, is in Government, and I am sorry to have to say that we in Wexford have been neglected over the past three years. We will not accept it any longer. I ask the Minister to ensure that we receive some priority in the coming weeks and months to deal with the situation in Wexford.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Howlin and Browne for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I join with them in extending my sympathy to the 150 workers at Wexford Weaving, their families and their community. I also extend my sympathy to the workers in Dungar<Col N="386" /> van and Dundalk who are also being told of job losses in both towns.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the success of the economy which creates more than 1,000 new jobs per week and which requires us to grant 1,000 work permits per week, there are still areas of the country which depend on basic manufacturing, and many of those jobs are, unfortunately, no longer viable. In the case of this company, almost £4 million of taxpayers' money was given to it in recent years with a view to saving it and making it competitive. That was not to be and it was not able to compete with companies in what are called low cost economies. Enterprise Ireland believed recently it had a potential investor from the United States but, after much consideration, the investor decided not to proceed.</P>
      <P>It is not all bleak. There are a number of companies in Wexford town and throughout the county that are applying for work permits and who do not appear to be able to find people in County Wexford for the vacancies they have. That is a fact of which the Deputies should be aware.</P>

      <P>That is a fact and I wish to put it on record because people might not understand it.</P>
      <P>Discussions have already taken place with FÁS, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Wexford County Enterprise Board, and they have been asked to ensure every effort is made to find alternative employment for the workers who have lost their jobs. I understand some of the workers have already approached the Wexford County Enterprise Board and have been made aware of the range of assistance available to them.</P>
      <P>FÁS, in conjunction with SIPTU, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Wexford Area Partnership will meet the workforce next Thursday with a view to providing as much assistance as possible with CV preparation, skills audit, self-employment, training and employment services.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland had maintained a close relationship with Wexford Weaving since its takeover in April 2000. The company's focus over the past 12 months had been on capability improvements, and Enterprise Ireland had been actively working with the company on this area. In addition, Enterprise Ireland had been working with the company to explore opportunities in new markets. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of everyone, Wexford Weaving Limited was incurring considerable losses which forced yesterday's closure announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of its strategy to ensure a greater regional spread of enterprises and with a view to <Col N="387" /> ensuring new employment opportunities for areas such as Wexford, Enterprise Ireland held an event today in Dublin called Into the Regions. I attended it earlier today and there was considerable interest from some Dublin based companies in expansion possibilities in Wexford. The county is being heavily promoted, not just for foreign direct investment, and Deputies must acknowledge there is a slowdown on the technology side because of what is happening in the United States, in the electronics area in particular, but also for companies in Dublin examining expansion possibilities into the regions. Enterprise Ireland tells me that Wexford is seen as an attractive location for those expansion possibilities and I hope they are successful.</P>
    <P>The object of the showcase today was to arrange contacts between regional representatives and Dublin based businesses. This will be the first in a series of marketing initiatives aimed at having expansion located in the regions. Initial indications are positive and could result in new employment being generated in places outside the capital.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed Wexford has not done better and I said that in the House yesterday. Wexford, Laois, Offaly and north Tipperary are probably the four areas that have not done well and I am disappointed about that. That is why I put together the Wexford initiative which submitted its final report to me on 31 March last. The report sets out a comprehensive blueprint for the development of the county and makes recommendations across a wide number of investment priorities. The successful implementation of the report, which has been undertaken by a sub-group of the county development board, will do much to improve the environment for enterprise in County Wexford.</P>
    <P>A financial services company which is expected to employ more than 300 people is currently constructing a 30,000 square foot office building on the business park and recruitment has already commenced. IDA Ireland will continue actively to promote the 42,500 square foot advance facility at Whitemill industrial estate. In addition, it will work towards addressing the various impediments to a new inward investment identified in the Wexford Enterprise Initiative report.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to the IDA in relation to the delays in the building of the advance factories. I had a meeting recently with representatives from Rosslare. I, too, am frustrated that something that seems so simple should take so long. I hope the matters which are holding those projects back can be resolved quickly.</P>
    <P>Because of my concern, not just in relation to the closures but with vulnerable companies in the Wexford area, I believe we must do more. It is not acceptable that any area should not be attractive for investment. The climate is favourable in Ireland, particularly given the demands on companies in the greater Dublin area. Wexford is <Col N="388" /> accessible and has a sufficiently large population. It is close to the third level facility in Waterford and has, as Deputy Howlin has frequently reminded me, an excellent port. It also has a good hotel infrastructure, which is important for industrial investment. In the next week or so I intend to meet the chief executives of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to see how the agencies can work together towards a positive outcome for Wexford town and the other towns in the county in the short to medium term.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - School Staffing.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me time to raise this important issue. St. Gabriel's national school, Cowper Street, Dublin 7, has already documented for the Department in great detail, the problems the school is tackling and the resources it needs, given its special circumstances. The school needs an extra teaching post over and above the promised staffing level for September this year. This is essential to enable the school to retain a teacher per class at each level in the school, operate a manageable pupil-teacher ratio in each class and provide a badly needed remedial mathematics class.</P>
      <P>There is a very young population in the school's immediate catchment area which is located in area D of the north-west inner city. More than one fifth of the population is aged 14 years and under. The 1996 census shows that 70.4% of the population aged 15 years and over had left school at the time of or before their junior certificate, compared to 40.2% in the north-west inner city as a whole and 36.2% in Dublin. Only 10% of the past pupils of the school in question have completed the leaving certificate since 1994.</P>
      <P>The area network, in its area action plan for 1999-2004 for the north-west inner city, states that the school is located in an area of immense socio-economic disadvantage and deprivation. Difficult family circumstances impacting on children and their experiences, development, education and future employment denote a spiralling circle of disadvantage. School is a refuge and a haven of peace and fair play and a step towards equal opportunity, provided the pupil-teacher ratio enables effective delivery of a child-centred education where the needs of the individual pupil are adequately met.</P>
      <P>Following an amalgamation in 1996 of the former girls' and boys' schools it was considered by the school authorities a priority to have a teacher per class, in order to meet the needs of every child. The pupil-teacher ratio for disadvantaged schools was reduced to 29:1 a number of years ago. Because the school has always considered 29:1 to be far in excess of one where the needs of all could be met, one of the remedial teachers and both concessionary teachers were assigned to classroom duties. Consequently class sizes have been around 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past year, however, the school's numbers have increased, particularly in the junior <Col N="389" /> section. With no extra staffing and a directive to keep the pupil-teacher ratio in junior classes at 20:1, the school will have to lump senior classes together. Some of fifth class will have to work with sixth class, and so on. This would be a retrograde step and detrimental to the excellent efforts being made by teachers to meet the individual needs of all pupils.</P>
    <P>The school is due an extra teacher next September, due to the increased enrolment of the previous year. It had hoped to establish a much needed remedial mathematics post with that appointment. However, in order to keep classes in the junior section to 20 pupils, it must deploy six teachers there. As there are at least 27 in second class, seven will have to be moved back to work with first class in order to maintain a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1, and so on along the line causing multiple or mixed classes. This, the school says, is not a satisfactory arrangement and furthermore, means new children who come to live in the area cannot be enrolled.</P>
    <P>In order to keep senior classes as single units the school must deploy four teachers there. Consequently the new assistant must take a class and the school must again forgo its remedial mathematics class.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State. I know the work of this school at first hand. It deserves this chance and badly needs these resouces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline to the House the current position on staffing at St. Gabriel's national school, Cowper Street, Dublin 7.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question increased from 166 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 188 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and seven mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year as compared with a principal and six teachers for the current school year. In addition, the school has two learning support teachers, a special class teacher, two concessionary posts due to the school's disadvantaged status, a home-school liaison teacher based in the school and a teacher for non-national pupils.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware of the new disadvantaged programme, Giving Children an Even Break, which was launched by the Department on 4 January last, will run over a three year period and cost £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to over 2,300 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools invited to participate in the new programme were identified through a survey of edu<Col N="390" /> cational disadvantage in primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre for the Department last year. A key condition of participation in the new programme is that the additional resources must be used for the provision of holistic supports for pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentration of at-risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocation to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in junior classes, infants through to second class, and a ratio of 29:1 in senior classes, third class through to sixth class.</P>
    <P>The school in question is included in the urban dimension of the programme and is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £2,479 in the current year towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned. The school concerned is also one of a number of urban schools considered for additional teaching staff under the programme. However, it was deemed that the school already had sufficient teaching staff to implement the maximum class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes and 29:1 in senior classes in respect of both the current school year and the school year commencing next September.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank the Deputy for raising this matter and trust that I have clarified the staffing position in relation to this school. I am sure the Deputy will agree the school will benefit from the generosity of this Government to our educational system at primary level and at all levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The headlines of an <i>Irish Times</i> sports article written by Ian O'Riordan said it all: &ldquo;Youth Olympians Pay the Price&rdquo;, &ldquo;Athletics &ndash; Another Row Over Kit&rdquo;. Twenty 16 and 17 year olds are apparently being prevented from taking part in the European Youth Olympics because of a row between two sporting organisations. The deadline for this group of young people to participate internationally has been missed. I look forward to what the Minister has to say but, on the face of it, this seems to be an extraordinary situation. Coaches are committed to nurturing young talent by giving their time and energy. Young people have participated at national level to qualify for the European Youth Olympics, yet we now discover that they have not been officially entered for this international event because of a <Col N="391" /> row. This has happened in the context of a major debate over a new national stadium and encouraging young people to participate in sport. What sort of example does this provide for these young people? One can only imagine their dismay, upset and sense of loss, and that of their families, in being denied the opportunity to participate internationally due to a dispute that first surfaced several years ago between two sporting organisations. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about it.</P>
      <P>The European Youth Olympics would have represented a wonderful opportunity for the cream of Irish juvenile athletes to develop their talents on an international stage. Of all the teams, the athletes are the only ones who will suffer from this disagreement which, unfortunately, has prevented their participation. One can only imagine the disappointment this has caused.</P>
      <P>Has the Government and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation taken any action to resolve this matter, or do they intend to? Given the enthusiasm, hard work and sporting dedication demonstrated by these young people, it is extraordinary that a barrier has been erected to prevent their participation in the European Youth Olympics.</P>
      <P>According to reports, the feuding centres over the OCI's insistence that the AAI give a written guarantee that athletes would wear the official Olympic gear. However, each association has a contract with a rival brand. This dispute has gone on for a long time and it must be terribly disappointing for the young people involved. They have reached all the qualifying standards, yet they find that through no fault of their own they are being denied the opportunity to represent their country in Mercia, Spain, because of this impasse.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a number of questions and I hope he will be able to respond to them. Why has this row continued for five years? What can be done about it? What action is the Government taking to resolve the issue so that these young people can represent Ireland abroad? What role has the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation played, or does he intend to play, in this matter to ensure that a solution is found? What are these young people meant to say to their peer group from other countries with whom they have participated in other events? How will they explain their non appearance at this event in July because of an administrative row between two sporting organisations?</P>
      <P>Our international reputation is being damaged by this matter. Young people are being denied an opportunity to participate and they are falling victim to this dispute. It is extraordinary that such a thing is happening to this group of young people. I hope action can be taken, even at this late stage, to allow them to represent Ireland at this important event which is necessary for them, their families and for sport in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. While the matter raised by her is primarily an issue between two independent, autonomous organisations, I share her concern that sport, and athletics in particular, cannot but be adversely affected by yet another public disagreement of this kind.</P>
      <P>It is vital that all the energies and resources of all those organisations and individuals charged with the responsibility to promote and develop sport, should be utilised to the maximum. To compete with any degree of success on the world stage nowadays requires a great deal of commitment, dedication and discipline, not just from the athletes but from the organisations and agencies who provide the back-up, support and the environment in which the athlete can develop and thrive in the pursuit of excellence.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that because of my concerns in relation to the performance of so many of our competitors at the Sydney Olympics last year, I called on the relevant organisations to come together and work more effectively in future in achieving and maintaining high levels of performance in international competition, particularly in the Olympic games.</P>
      <P>I requested the Irish Sports Council to carry out an in-depth review of Ireland's preparations for and participation in Sydney and the report and recommendations for future actions were published last February. The council, in co-operation with the other relevant bodies, is well under way in the implementation of the recommendations. A meeting of the key agencies, including the Olympic Council of Ireland, the national governing bodies of sport, and the national coaching and training centre has taken place. All parties have committed themselves to the recommendations and the spirit of co-operation required in the lead up to Athens 2004, and beyond.</P>
      <P>A special high performance committee, which includes the OCI, has been established by the council, to assist and advise in the development of a high performance strategy for sport in Ireland. In addition, a special liaison group has been established between the sports council and the OCI to help maintain liaison and co-operation between both bodies and, crucially, to drive and monitor the implementation of the Sydney review recommendations.</P>
      <P>In the light of these major initiatives to improve sport in Ireland and to introduce a new, dynamic spirit of generosity and co-operation between organisations, in the interests of our young sportsmen and women, I hope both bodies involved in the issue raised by the Deputy will come together and resolve their differences in the interest of the greater good of sport in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The current position is that an Alouette 111 single engined helicopter is based at Waterford. This aircraft because of its visual contact flight conditions, daylight only restricted range, is not particularly suited for offshore marine emergency helicopter cover. It is, however, well suited for mountain, cliff and close-in marine search and rescue operations conducted by daylight in visual contact flight conditions.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Alouette is in replacement on a temporary basis of the Dauphin which crashed on Tramore beach on 2 July 1999 with the tragic loss of four crewmen.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to urgently upgrade the current unsuitable SAR helicopter service in Waterford and have pursued with my colleague, the Minister for Defence, how this might be achieved. We have now commenced negotiations on a contract for the early provision of a new dedicated all-weather, night flying, medium lift helicopter capacity at Waterford. This provision will be an interim arrangement pending a more permanent placing of a fully suitable service in Waterford. The Department has also commenced the contract procedures for the acquisition on contract of the latter service. My Department is currently in negotiation with the Department of Finance in regard to the provision of finance for these helicopter search and rescue improvements.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at the moment to put any precise date on when the replacement will be in place although it is my hope that the necessary finance will become available and the aircraft will be operational early next year.</P>

      <P>I recently presented Coillte Teoranta's annual report and accounts for the year 2000 to the Government. Overall, the company's financial performance was strong last year. Profit was £20.12 million, an increase of 20% over 1999 and the best since Coillte's establishment in 1989. Total revenues for the year were £97.10 million, an increase of 10% over 1999. The volume of timber sold increased by 9% to 2.73 million cubic metres. In the sawlog category, the volume sold increased by 16% to 1.65 million cubic metres, due to strong demand arising from increased processing capacity. Revenue from timber sales increased by 8% to £66.52 million. Non-timber revenue was strong at £30.58 million, an increase of 12% over 1999, reflecting improved performance of Coillte's ancillary business units. Ancillary activities include nurseries, Christmas tree production, leisure facilities and overseas consultancy work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coillte has also recently successfully completed the Forest Stewardship Council certification pro<Col N="395" /> cess. This certification verifies that Coillte's forests are managed in a way that is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.</P>
    <P>In relation to the future of Coillte, work is advancing on several key issues which follow on from the consultancy study on the company carried out by AIB Capital Markets and Merrill Lynch International. Copies of the study were circulated to Deputies shortly after its completion. One of the main recommendations of the study was that a development programme for the timber industry be put in place to create the desired market dynamic for the sector. The timber industry development group has been established by the Tánaiste and is working to this end. The group includes representatives of the stakeholders involved in the sector. The consultancy study also recommended a revised strategic plan and efficiency programme for Coillte and these are currently being put in place by the company. The Deputy may also be interested to know that the study recommended a retention of the <i>status quo</i> in relation to ownership of Coillte for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I will continue to review the position on an ongoing basis and in the light of the work being undertaken.</P>

      <P>The Irish territorial seas, as defined by the Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act, <Col N="396" /> 1987, extend to a distance of 12 nautical miles from baselines. The Irish fishery zone is defined in the Maritime Jurisdiction (Exclusive Fishery Limits) Order, 1976, and extends to a distance of 200 nautical miles from baselines, or where appropriate, to the equitable equidistant line between the State and another state.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, an exclusive economic zone is defined as an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea in respect of which the rights of the coastal state and the rights and freedoms of other states are governed by the relevant provisions of the convention. The convention provides that an exclusive economic zone shall not extend beyond 200 nautical miles from baselines. The coastal state has, subject to the provisions of the convention, sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the sea bed and of the sea-bed and its subsoil.</P>
      <P>A change to a limit of 350 nautical miles for fisheries or exclusive economic zone purposes would involve an amendment of the convention. This matter has not been discussed in the UN fora concerning the convention. The question of an extension of fishery limits has not arisen for discussion within the EU.</P>
      <P>The convention provides separately for the continental shelf. The continental shelf of a coastal state comprises the sea-bed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea to the outer edge of the continental margin. The outer limits cannot exceed either 350 nautical miles from baselines, or 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metre isobath. The coastal state exercises sovereign rights over the continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting mineral and other non-living resources of the sea-bed and subsoil.</P>
      <P>Where the outer limit of the continental shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles from baselines, the coastal state must establish the limits based on geological and geomorphological criteria and details of the limits must, in accordance with the convention, be submitted to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf before mid-May 2009 for approval. Ireland has designated continental shelf parts of which extend up to 500 nautical miles from baselines and are the subject of competing claims by other coastal states. Ireland's detailed submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf is in the course of preparation at present.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any demand from the public for a breach of the causeway at Bull Island. As the Deputy will have noted from my reply to his questions on 10 February 2000 and Wednesday, 21 March 2001, I am aware of resolutions by Dublin City Council on this matter.</P>
      <P>The question of breaching the causeway is primarily a matter for Dublin Corporation. My predecessor's reply to the Deputy's question on 25 November 1999 set out, in some detail, the steps which Dublin Corporation would have to take under the foreshore Acts before the causeway could be breached and, in particular, drew attention to the fact that as Bull Island is designated by Dúchas as a special protection area it would be necessary to consult with and obtain the approval of Dúchas before any work could be undertaken.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my reply to his previous questions that I have approved grant aid to assist Dublin Corporation in a study of the effects of breaching the causeway. I await the results of this study with interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent publication by the WWF entitled, The Status of Wild Atlantic Salmon: A River by River Assessment. The document is stated to be a country by country report on populations of wild Atlantic salmon and identifies threats to these populations from various factors such as exploitation levels, degradation of fisheries habitat and water pollution.</P>
      <P>The Marine Institute informs me that it has requested clarification from the WWF regarding some of the data and statements relating to Ireland which, in the view of the Marine Institute, are unsubstantiated and erroneous.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Marine Institute to provide its own most up to date assessment of the state of stocks as quick as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Salmon conservation measures at present are largely based on effort reduction. The commercial fishing sector is significantly restricted in terms of seasons, number of days fishing and times of fishing. Furthermore, the maximum <Col N="398" /> number of commercial licences which can be issued by the regional fisheries boards is capped.</P>
    <P>Shortly after coming into office last year I moved quickly to establish the National Salmon Commission to advise me on the management and development of the national salmon resource. The work of the commission facilitated the introduction of the wild salmon tagging scheme at the start of this year. The purpose of the tagging scheme is to provide a verifiable count of the salmon catch by all sectors. The information gathered by the tagging scheme together with the fish counter programme will enable us to quantify our salmon in a new way. The real time management which will flow from the system will pay major dividends for the management of the salmon resource.</P>
    <P>The commission has recently made a number of recommendations in relation to the conservation of spring salmon which are being processed by my Department at present with a view to the introduction of measures for next season.</P>
    <P>In addition to making co-funding available for pilot set-aside schemes in catchments, I have asked the Salmon Commission to advise on appropriate mechanisms for the reduction of commercial salmon fishing effort in light of various proposals put to me. In conjunction, I have asked my Department to review comprehensively all the strategic options for future management of the commercial salmon fishery.</P>
    <P>The salmon is vulnerable to a very complex range of factors. In particular the eutrophication of our inland waters is a major problem. I am consulting with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on pilot initiatives for enhanced co-operation by all interests and agencies in individual catchments of eutrophication to tackle the causes.</P>
    <P>Ireland still has a stock of wild Atlantic salmon which can if sustainably managed support a quality commercial and recreational fishery. However, there is no room for complacency in relation to the state of stocks. I must emphasise again that no sector can be relieved of its obligation to reduce its fishing effort on salmon in catchments at risk.</P>

      <P>The marine tourism and leisure sector in Ireland is one of great potential which offers the State a genuine opportunity to foster balanced economic development and job <Col N="399" /> creation. The Government fully recognised this potential and addressed the need for investment in marine recreational infrastructure by providing £20 million under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to the sector.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, my Department will have responsibility for administrating the marine tourism grant scheme, the main objectives of which will be to improve marine tourism access infrastructure, such as marinas, berths and slipways, and to encourage integrated development and co-operative partnerships, particularly in relation to networks and clusters. The grant scheme will form part of the two regional operational programmes and the funding has been allocated with £6 million for the south and east region and £14 million for the Border, midlands and western region.</P>
      <P>The marine tourism grant scheme is one of five sub-measures of the overall tourism measure of the national development plan. The scheme is currently being prepared by my Department in consultation with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Bord Fáilte and is expected to be launched later this summer.</P>
      <P>While applications for funding cannot be considered until the scheme is launched, nevertheless, details of those parties who have expressed an interest in the scheme are being kept on file and application forms will be sent to them as soon as they are available. I can assure the Deputy that once the formal scheme is in place, all applications received, including any which might be made in respect of Dunmanus Bay, will be assessed in accordance with the procedures laid down under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation referred to by the Deputy, together with a regulation for non-gill net tuna and other species fishing create a comprehensive legal framework which addresses a number of specific issues associated with the prosecution of these fisheries.</P>
      <P>The new legal framework fulfils a number of essential objectives. In the first instance it reflects the need to comply with our obligations and requirements at EU level and in relation to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas including by catch restrictions.</P>
      <P>The new framework is designed to ensure delivery of strategic national objectives in the context of the coming into force of the ban on drift netting for tuna next year. The newly established Irish quota for northern albacore tuna of 3,158 tonnes is a vitally important new fishing opportunity which will assist a significant portion of the whitefish fleet to diversify from fishing on traditional stocks already under pressure.</P>
      <P>To maximise the benefit of this quota for the whitefish fleet as a whole, it is necessary that the Irish fishing industry urgently develops the capability in longlining, trolling and pelagic trawling. The new legal framework is designed to facilitate progress being made in this area, otherwise the long-term capacity of the industry to catch and maximise the economic returns from this valuable quota will be undermined.</P>

      <P>As stated in previous replies on this matter, most recently on 3 April 2001, I have no direct role in the removal of the derelict tug at Clogherhead Pier, County Louth.</P>
      <P>I have previously outlined the provisions in the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, which govern the removal or rendering harmless of wrecked vessels. Under that Act, the appropriate authority is empowered to require the owner to remove or render harmless a wreck in circumstances where the wreck is a danger to navigation or constitutes a threat to the marine environment or related interests. The appropriate authority also has powers to remove or render harmless the offending wreck and to recover the expenses from the registered owner.</P>
      <P>The appropriate authority in this case is Louth County Council. I have been advised by Louth County Council that the registered owners of the vessel, Marine Blast Limited, has undertaken to remove the vessel from the harbour as soon as possible. If the Deputy has further concerns about the removal of this derelict tug, I suggest that he take up the matter directly with Louth County Council.</P>

      <P>In my reply to a previous question from the Deputy on 8 May, I indicated the precise number of fishermen engaged in fishing at sea on a full-time or part-time basis in specified years since 1969. While the number of fishermen in 1998, the latest year for which records are available, was about 20% less than it was a decade ago, it is broadly similar to the number engaged in fishing 25 years ago. Nevertheless, I am con<Col N="402" /> scious that the fishing industry like other sectors is experiencing labour shortages and that there is a tendency for workers to be increasingly drawn to the larger urban centres.</P>
      <P>This Government, through the whitefish fleet renewal scheme and the current investment programmes under the national development plan, is assisting the largest ever programme of investment in the seafood sector. These investments will secure a competitive, sustainable industry going forward and will help underpin the future development of coastal communities.</P>
      <P>A variety of licensing conditions have existed for a number of years which restrict many larger vessels from fishing inshore. In line with the Government's commitment to promote the development of inshore fisheries, I have made significant funding available to underpin initiatives on the management and conservation of inshore fisheries.</P>

      <P>The state of the Celtic Sea herring stock is assessed annually by the Marine Institute and these assessments are reviewed by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES. The assessments of this stock in 1998, 1999 and 2000 indicated that there were no serious concerns about the stock. A recent assessment of the stock gave dramatically different results, suggesting that the stock had declined significantly in recent years. The Marine Institute regards the recent assessment as uncertain and ICES decided in May that the assessment was not sufficiently realistic to form a basis for management advice. The Marine Institute and the fishing industry's <Col N="407" /> South and West Pelagic Committee have agreed a co-ordinated scientific programme to be carried out over the summer months with a view to clarifying the state of the stock in advance of the ICES meeting in October.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, I was approached by vessel owners who had participated in the Celtic Sea herring fishery in the past and were now precluded from participating by virtue of the fact that they had upgraded their vessels under the whitefish renewal programme and had not been able to purchase the necessary increment of active pelagic tonnage. I agreed to look at the policy of applying preclusions to fishing licences in these circumstances and I am in the process of consulting the industry on whether or not this aspect of fishing vessel licensing policy should be changed. To date I have made no decision in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of the Corrib gas reservoir presents opportunities for the west in terms of short-term building and construction jobs and, most importantly, in bringing an energy corridor through areas of the west where there has hitherto been deficiencies in energy supply. The latter development holds the potential, along with the BGE ringmain to Galway, to upgrade the energy infrastructure of the west and north-west. The Government is anxious to deliver direct gas supply to as many towns and centres in the west and north-west where to date there has been no availability of gas. The Government is also anxious that the quality of electricity supply to the west and north-west is improved and sees the availability of natural gas in the region making a major contribution to that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BGE is already committed to connecting the natural gas network to as many towns as can be reached within their commercial mandate. In addition to providing a gas supply to certain towns in the catchment area of the proposed pipeline and spur-line, I understand that BGE is examining the prospect of supplying gas to other centres of population in the north-west as part of a national study to determine centres that can be supplied with gas on an economic basis. When this assessment has been completed, a fuller picture as to the costs and viability of such extensions will emerge. The Government recently gave approval in principle for the construction of spur pipelines to the north-west of Ireland. The Government recognises that State funding will be required as BGE has a statutory obligation to <Col N="408" /> extend gas networks to new areas of supply on a commercial basis only.</P>
    <P>My priority is to see the extension of the gas network and a new supply off the west coast used to accelerate economic development in the Border, midland and western region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

      <P>The last inspection, carried out by this Administration, was held on 7 April last. We had carried out two previous inspections on 12 March and 21 March.</P>
      <P>I understand the detentions by the UK authorities were related to the inability of some crew members to perform, to the satisfaction of the inspectors, during emergency exercises or drills on board. It appears that some crew members were not able to display sufficient proficiency when presented with a fire emergency scenario. In addition, it appears the vessel's ISM, international safety management system, which should ensure that such deficiencies are identified in advance, was not of an acceptable standard. Accordingly, the UK authorities detained the vessel until these matters were rectified. Officials from my Department were in contact with their UK colleagues and were kept aware of developments.</P>
      <P>Swansea Cork Ferries has claimed that the responsibility for the safe operation of the vessel rests with the owners from whom it has chartered the vessel. It claims the owners must operate the ISM system, train the crews to acceptable standards and provide a safe ship complying with all the statutory requirements. However, in my opinion, Swansea Cork Ferries has a duty of care to those passengers to whom it sells travel tickets. Accordingly, it must play a role in ensuring the owners of the vessel establish any procedures necessary so that those passengers can be carried in safety.</P>

    <P>Officials from my Department have met the senior management of Swansea Cork Ferries and discussed these issues in great detail. The owners of the vessel have now retained an expert in ISM matters to ensure the necessary management systems are in place within the owner's company itself and on board the vessel. Swansea Cork Ferries is now employing its own expert to ensure the owners and the vessel continue to comply with the necessary requirements in order that it <Col N="409" /> can be satisfied that its passengers are being carried in safety.</P>
    <P>In addition, officials from my Department carried out inspections and drills on board the vessel in Cork yesterday, 13 June, and was satisfied with the crew's ability to handle different emergency situations. However, we will continue to monitor closely the vessel to ensure that these standards are maintained into the future and will not hesitate to detain the vessel in the event that safety standards fall below the required levels.</P>

      <P>Ireland has two proven reserves of gas. These are the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton gas field including south-west Kinsale, and the Corrib gas field which has been declared commercial and which is still being appraised. While exploration is progressing under 13 exploration licences, six licensing options and nine petroleum prospecting licences, these have not yet shown any reserves of oil or gas on a commercial scale.</P>
      <P>The data from the two proven reserves above are made available to the specialist staff in my Department at the same time as it becomes available to the operator of the licence. The data and information are analysed and interpreted by these experts who can provide me with an assessment. No case has been made to me for an independent assessment of these reserves, and I am fully satisfied with the service provided by these experts. Therefore, I would not see that such an independent assessment is warranted or necessary.</P>

      <P>I have been paying particular attention to the work of the Carra-Mask-Corrib Water Protection Group and recently I was pleased to speak at the formal launch of the group. This is a voluntary group established by three angling fed<Col N="410" /> erations in the Corrib catchment including the Carra Mask Angling Federation. One of the aims of the group is to raise awareness regarding pollution problems in our inland waters and I am fully supportive of this aim.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of their statutory remits in relation to the conservation of fisheries, the Central Fisheries Board and the Western Regional Fisheries Board have carried out water quality surveys on the three lakes. The Central Fisheries Board informs me that these surveys show an overall improvement in Lower Corrib and a slight deterioration in the open water of Upper Corrib, Mask and Carra. In the context of the Corrib plan, financed through the Tourism Angling Measure, the Western Regional Fisheries Board has reviewed the water quality data from 1997 to 2000 in the Corrib catchment. Some localised adverse impacts have been recorded in several rivers within the catchment due to domestic sewage, afforestation and agriculture. There are some specific locations in the lakes where quality is affected adjacent to inflowing rivers. However, there is no evidence of a significant worsening trend overall between 1997 and 2000.</P>
      <P>The western board estimates that the cost of the development of the catchments of Loughs Carra and Mask to maximise the trout production capacity would be in the region of £3 million to £4 million.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 55 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's forestry policy, as set out in Growing for the Future &ndash; A Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector in Ireland, is to increase Ireland's forest cover from its present level of 9% of land area to 17% by 2030. This strategy is to be achieved by planting approximately 20,000 hectares of forestry per annum. The planting programme is supported by a generous grants and premium package co-financed by the European Union. This significant increase in forestry will assist in countering the increase in greenhouse gases. Forestry is the only economic activity that can contribute to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Conifers are particularly well suited in this regard. These species play a significant role as a carbon sequestrator. It is estimated that on average one hectare of Sitka spruce absorbs 3.3 tonnes of carbon per year while broadleaves absorb 1.3 tonnes. Over its rotation one hectare of conifers will remove approximately 100 tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere, per hectare making them exceptionally efficient in combating the greenhouse gas effect.</P>
      <P>The national climate change strategy identifies the key role to be played by forestry in carbon sequestration. There have been ongoing discussions between my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in the context of the national climate change strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>COFORD, the Council for forest research and Development, is carrying out extensive work in the area of carbon sequestration with a view to maximising the sequestration potential of Irish forests. It is currently negotiating a research and development contract that will refine current estimates of carbon stocks in Irish forests. The results of this research will inform future forest service <Col N="412" /> policy. COFORD has also previously published an information leaflet on carbon sequestration entitled, The Carbon Connection.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suitability of particular species, soil and site as well as species determine the rate of forest growth and consequently the potential for carbon storage. The five most suitable species are grand fir, western hemlock, western red cedar, Sitka spruce and Douglas fir.</P>
    <P>Of these Sitka spruce and Douglas fir are the most commonly planted in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 57 to 59, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Irish and international law all vessels trading into and out of Irish ports are required to carry the appropriate certification to demonstrate compliance with the requisite international conventions applicable to ships of their size and type. All vessels are subject to surveys and inspections by their flag states and, under the European Union's port state control system, all vessels using Community ports are liable to inspections every six months by any of the EU states they are visit<Col N="413" /> ing. The application of port state control ensures that at any given time a large number of ships operating within the Community area have undergone an inspection by an EU port state in the previous six months.</P>
    <P>All Irish registered passenger and cargo vessels are inspected annually by my Department's surveyors and, in accordance with the port state control system, are liable to inspections every six months at the ports of other EU member states.</P>
    <P>Serious breaches of international convention requirements may result in the detention of a vessel. Two Irish flag vessels were detained by port states in the past year and others have had to rectify minor breaches within specified time frames.</P>
    <P>In relation to non-Irish registered vessels, last year my Department's surveyors inspected 194 such vessels which had not been inspected in the previous six months under port state control. Of these, 21 vessels were detained for non-compliance with the requisite international marine safety conventions.</P>
    <P>The monitoring of ships in EU waters by regular inspections under port state control, is proving to be an effective measure in encouraging full compliance with international safety standards and that the vast majority of vessels operating into and out of Irish ports are complying with international convention requirements.</P>

      <P>There have been significant recent developments regarding the provision of the mast for the Loran-C radio navigation system. At a recent meeting of the international steering committee which manages the Loran-C radio navigation system, two members of the committee, Germany and Norway, formally gave qualified notice of their withdrawal from the system at the expiry of the current agreement in 2004.</P>
      <P>This unexpected development means that Ireland must now move to determine its own marine radio navigation system in the likely absence of Loran-C. I have directed that we now proceed to assess the implications for Ireland of the qualified notice of withdrawal from the system by the German and Norwegian members; draw up our own policy on maritime radio navigation aids in consultation with all stakeholders, having regard to the relevance of the principle of avoiding sole dependence on one system, and to the vulnerability of GPS in that context, and to the availability of other possible aids to navigation; and in the meantime to suspend any work on the installation of a Loran-C mast in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have requested the Commissioners of Irish Lights to play a key advisory role in relation to the review which will be progressed on the basis of full consultation with all involved in the maritime safety area. I have asked my Department and the Commissioners of Irish Lights to draw up jointly a consultation document setting out an assessment of the state of radio-based aids to navigation around Ireland and the options for the future. This document will then be used as the basis for consultation.</P>

      <P>The basic research grants scheme, which is directed at supporting high-quality basic research projects in the third level sector, with a particular emphasis on the training of new graduates, is an essential element of the Government's research, technological development and innovation strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme has been expanded considerably in recent years from a base of £0.83 million in <Col N="415" /> 1994. The amount of £6.32 million for new projects which has been approved for the basic research grant scheme this year represents a substantial increase of 35% on the £4.68 million funding approved last year. The increase in overall funding has allowed a dramatic increase in funding granted to individual projects, with an average cost of £91,000 per project in 2001 compared to £55,000 last year. This expansion is in line with the recommendations contained in the independent review of the scheme carried out by Technopolis in 1997.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to basic research as a driver of economic growth extends beyond the basic research grants scheme. In particular, the technology foresight fund, administered by Science Foundation Ireland, will provide £500 million over the course of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to build up world class basic research capacity in niche areas of key strategic interest to Ireland in the fields of biotechnology and information and communication technologies. The programme for research in third level institutes &ndash; PRTLI &ndash; which is administered by the Higher Education Authority, also provides significant funding over the course of the national development plan for the strategic development of basic research infrastructure in Irish higher education institutions.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of the basic research grants scheme is to train researchers and develop a good research base here in Ireland. I am confident that the funding provided for basic research under the scheme and under the many other measures provided for in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, will ensure that this objective is met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The pattern of water based recreational activity throughout Ireland has changed significantly in recent years. Increased leisure time, greater tourism and a more affluent domestic society have all contributed to the growth of water based recreational pursuits, including the use of pleasure craft. The demand for this activity has given rise to an increase in the number of such craft including those of the powered variety.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that the Final Report of the Action Group on Small Powered Recreational Craft, including personal watercraft, was presented to me in April 2000. This report included a number of recommendations on the matter of the safe use of pleasure craft, and on the basis of these, the necessary legislative framework for the regulation of these craft was developed by my Department. The introduction of this legislative framework was achieved through the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000, which amended the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992. The result of these amendments is that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is now empowered to introduce statutory regulations to take account not only of the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants, but also the safety of other persons resulting from the use of the craft.</P>
      <P>In this regard I will shortly be introducing an initial phase of regulations which will contain national provisions governing the safe use of personal watercraft, jet skis, fast power craft and other mechanically propelled pleasure craft. These will include, <i>inter alia</i>, provisions relating to age restrictions, the carriage and use of lifejackets, restrictions on the use of alcohol and drugs as well as provisions relating to the careless and dangerous driving of such craft.</P>
      <P>The Action Group on Small Powered Recreational Craft made other recommendations relating to issues such as insurance and registration of pleasure craft as well as training and competence of users. These will now be addressed in greater detail by my Department, in full consultation with those in the sector, in order to design legislative provisions which are reasonable and practical, following the successful introduction and implementation of the initial phase of regulations.</P>

      <P>In accordance with my Department's certification and licensing regimes the Department's Marine Survey Office surveys all passenger vessels every year and all passenger boats every two years. My Department's surveyors also carry out spot checks at various times, including at the weekends during the peak season. My Department's policy is to prosecute owners or hirers of vessels which are found to be illegally carrying passengers. In addition, the Garda authorities are notified of those vessels and boats which hold certificates or licences to carry passengers and local Garda stations should be aware of which vessels are operating legally in their areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in my reply of 8 May to a similar question raised by the Deputy there were developments in relation to the Corrib gas accumulation.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Energy Ireland declared the Corrib gas field commercial in January this year on behalf of its co-venturers, Statoil and Marathon, and have applied to me for a lease for its development and it is expected that the lease will be issued in the near future. Enterprise Energy Ireland has plans to bring the gas ashore by October 2003 and expects the field to be in production for about 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only one exploration well has been completed offshore Ireland in the past 12 months, where Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited drilled an exploration well last April in the Rockall trough. <Col N="419" /> The well was unsuccessful and has now been plugged and abandoned. Two exploration wells are currently in progress. Statoil commenced drilling an exploration well in the Porcupine Basin last month and drilling is ongoing. An application by EDC, Europe, Limited to drill an exploration well in the Fastnet Basin has been approved by my Department and drilling will commence within the next few days.</P>
    <P>As regards non-petroleum minerals exploration, no new finds have been reported to me since I last answered a question on this subject on 4 May 2001, ref. no. 13028/01. The State itself does not carry out prospecting. In setting and agreeing the exploration programme under any licence, I ensure that the licence is awarded to the candidate proposing the most advantageous programme. By monitoring the reports of licence holders and site visits, I ensure that the terms of the commitment are met in each case, that we are immediately aware of finding any significant mineralisation and that there is a suitably aggressive pursuit of any positive results. I am pleased that recent work has identified three new zinc prospects in counties Laois, Limerick and Wicklow, which are being followed up. Should any of these prove to be economically viable this will be evidenced to me by an application for a State mining facility. Such an application would be made in parallel with applications to the relevant local authority for planning permission under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts and to the EPA for an integrated pollution control licence.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying that we have not only maintained but increased in real terms our share of world exploration funding for non-petroleum minerals in the context of a major global cutback over the past three years. The most recent report that I laid before the Houses under the Minerals Development Acts showed that at the end of December 2000 there were 480 prospecting licences being operated. The number of licences has increased over the past three years. We are actively engaged in promoting investment interest in minerals exploration from overseas companies, in order to keep the level of exploration in the country as high as possible. The success of earlier exploration work and prospect of finding further commercial orebodies encourages the market to concentrate on exploration for certain suites of minerals and de-emphasise others.</P>
    <P>As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the continuing attractiveness of Ireland, my Department is continuing its comparative study of international royalty and tax regimes. We are at present examining the preliminary results of that study. That examination and the further study results will inform policy decisions in the future and allow us to maintain our competitive status.</P>
    <P>Field work under existing licences had been hampered over recent months by the precautions to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. The restriction is being eased gradually as it is <Col N="420" /> deemed prudent and on the advice of the expert group set up by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. While most restrictions have now been relaxed it is still necessary to observe care and hygiene when entering on farmlands. I am pleased at the way those involved in the industry have taken the necessary precautions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Community Directive 94/25 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administration provisions of member states relating to recreational craft became fully operational in June 1998, and has been transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Recreational Craft) Regulations, 1998, S.I. No. 40 of 1998. The aim of the directive is to eliminate barriers to trade by approximating design and construction standards for recreational craft throughout the Community. The directive does not, however, regulate the safe operation of recreational craft or compliance with other safety standards by users of such craft. Other than this directive, there are no internationally agreed standards for the safe use of all pleasure craft and each country implements its own regulatory framework as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that the final report of the Action Group on Small Powered Recreational Craft, including personal watercraft, was presented to me in April 2000. This report included a number of recommendations on the matter of the safe use of pleasure craft and on the basis of these the necessary legislative framework for the regulation of these craft was developed by my Department. The introduction of this legislative framework was achieved through the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000, which amended the <Col N="422" /> Merchant Shipping Act, 1992. The result of these amendments is that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is now empowered to introduce statutory regulations to take account not only of the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants, but also the safety of other persons resulting from the use of the craft.</P>
    <P>In this regard I will shortly be introducing an initial phase of regulations which will contain national provisions governing the safe use of personal watercraft, jet skis, fast power craft and other mechanically propelled pleasure craft. These will include, <i>inter alia</i>, provisions relating to age restrictions, the carriage and use of lifejackets, restrictions on the use of alcohol and drugs as well as provisions relating to the careless and dangerous driving of such craft.</P>
    <P>The Action Group on Small Powered Recreational Craft made other recommendations relating to issues such as insurance and registration of pleasure craft as well as training and competence of users. These will now be addressed in greater detail by my Department, in full consultation with those in the sector, in order to design legislative provisions which are reasonable and practical, following the successful introduction and implementation of the initial phase of regulations.</P>

      <P>My Department has consistently taken a full and active part at EU and international level in this regard.</P>
      <P>Ireland led the campaign at the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, to have the Irradiated Nuclear Fuels, INF, Code made mandatory and following this, the EU adopted a directive requiring all vessels carrying such materials bound for or leaving a Community port to comply with strict notification and controls. In accordance with the EU directive on port state control, inspections relevant to pollution prevention, safety related matters and crew ability and competence are carried out on foreign vessels including tankers entering our ports. When deficiencies are noted, the vessel may be detained until the problems have been rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Erika incident in December 1999 off the coast of France served as a timely reminder of the importance of effective preventative measures. Since then, Ireland has participated in drawing up a number of measures which include <Col N="423" /> the phasing out of certain single hulled tankers in favour of double hulled types, improvements in liability regimes, enhanced inspection of foreign ships, more effective ship reporting arrangements, very stringent condition assessment of certain older tankers and the fitting of data recorders, black boxes. EU member states, including Ireland, have been prominent in obtaining agreement at the IMO to have those measures which are appropriate applied also at international level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions in relation to the re-opening of individual railway lines are matters for the board and management of CIE and Iarnród Éireann. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that they have no plans to carry out a feasibility study into the re-opening of the Collooney to Claremorris line as the anticipated level of passenger carryings relative to the capital and operating costs would not justify such a service. The line was closed finally in 1975 because of low patronage and in the absence of major development along the rail corridor its re-opening is unlikely to be viable.</P>
      <P>The rail investment programme currently being implemented by Iarnród Éireann is the largest investment ever put into railways in Ireland. However, these resources are limited and must be utilised so that the best value for money is achieved for the Irish public. Therefore, the investment programme is being implemented in a prioritised manner on the basis of rail safety, customer demand and expected economic return.</P>
      <P>Given the high capital and operational costs associated with investment in new rail infrastructure and services, I am not in a position to consider new rail projects at present other than those which are outlined in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>A number of alternative uses have been suggested for the Collooney to Claremorris rail formation in recent times including the installation of a gas pipeline and the development of the line for leisure activities. I understand that CIE and Iarnród Éireann are willing to discuss all these options with interested parties.</P>
      <P>While I am informed that no formal proposals for a gas pipeline on the rail formation have been received by CIE, I understand that, for safety concerns, the laying of a gas pipe line would necessarily lead to its abandonment for rail purposes.</P>

This concession is limited to those farmers whose period of eligibility under the scheme would have been reduced if they had to delay their applications until the lifting of these restrictions. An application in these circumstances could be processed up to payment stage. Once the stock is disposed of and proof that the herd number has been cancelled is furnished to the Department, payment will be made to the applicants from the valid date of their applications.</P>

      <P>Consequently his 2000 area aid application has now been processed based only on the information to hand from his 1999 application, excluding the new plot of land, and is clear for payment with no outstanding errors.</P>
      <P>The closing date for area aid applications was 28 April 2000, and late applications incurred a penalty of 1% per working day on any aid payable.

He was written to by my Department on 9 October 2000 advising him that he was in breach of paragraph 19 of the terms and conditions of the cattle headage scheme. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed. He replied on 20 November 2000 stating that he had another eligible animal. He was written to on 11 December 2000 informing him that no grant would be paid on the ineligible animal, and that grants payable on the remaining animals on his cattle headage application would be subject to a reduction penalty of 6.25% under the terms and conditions governing the cattle headage scheme. He was given the opportunity to appeal this decision by writing to the headage and premia appeals unit, Agriculture House, Kildare Street, Dublin 2 within 21 days.

He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed and he wrote to my Department on 3 May 2001 with details of a replacement animal.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. The guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons aged 16 upwards, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a <Col N="437" /> medical card holder are not normally entitled to a medical card. Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. The review is expected to be completed mid-year.</P>
    <P>In addition, the whole issue of eligibility is being examined in the context of the new health strategy that is currently being prepared in my Department and is expected to be completed mid-year.</P>

      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme. The findings of the report are being fully considered in my Department. In this regard, it is presumed the Deputy is referring to the issue raised by the Ombudsman of the interpretation by health boards of article 8.2 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993.</P>
      <P>Article 8.2 allows health boards disregard a sum equivalent to one fifth of the old age non-contributory pension when assessing means and calculating the amount of subvention to be paid. An additional allocation of £4 million was made available in 1998 to six of the eight health boards, where the regulations were applied incorrectly, to meet the costs of arrears payments in respect of the full implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, and subsequent regulations. When the Department became aware of continuing delays in paying arrears it took the matter up with the relevant boards and is continuing to pursue the matter.</P>
      <P>The current position is that where arrears were due to be paid, health boards have made retrospective payments in respect of persons currently resident in nursing homes. Some boards have also paid arrears in respect of former subvention recipients now deceased and former recipients who are no longer resident in nursing homes. I am advised that in excess of £1.2 million has been repaid to date. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has instructed the relevant boards to take immediate steps to pay all outstanding arrears as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Stringent drinking water standards are prescribed in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988 (SI 81 of 1988) which transpose Council Directive 80/778/EEC. Article 4 of these regulations places a duty on sanitary authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure that water intended for human consumption meets these standards. This duty is performed under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency. Chlorination is a means of disinfection for drinking water supplies and, depending on individual circumstances, may require augmentation by other measures to ensure compliance with the prescribed standards.</P>

      <P>In recognition of the valuable work being done funding for the scheme has been increased significantly in recent years from £6 million in 1999 to £8 million last year and £8.6 million for 2001.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year Kilkenny County Council sought my Department's approval for the use of internal capital receipts for the purposes of the disabled person's grants scheme. The priority claim on the use of internal capital receipts is to meet the needs of the main local authority housing programme and the remedial works scheme to supplement the Exchequer funding in these areas. Accordingly it was not possible to accede to the council's request. I have asked my Department to re-examine the position in the light of the council's commitments under the local authority housing programme and the remedial works scheme, the availability of internal capital receipts and need to provide adequately for the payment of the disabled person's grant by the council.</P>
      <P>The disabled person's grant scheme is administered by local authorities in accordance with the legal framework laid down in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, and statutory regulations made under the Act. The framework laid down in the statutory regulations is, as far as practicable, designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities in administering the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for the local authority to decide the staffing resources to be made available, the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid. It is also a matter for the authority to ensure that there are <Col N="442" /> no undue delays in the processing of applications for disabled persons grants.</P>
    <P>The regulations governing the scheme do not stipulate that authorities obtain a medical report or an occupational therapists report. Authorities generally require such reports to ensure that the most appropriate works are carried out to meet the needs of the applicant and that the potential long-term needs of the applicant are addressed having regard to their disability.</P>
    <P>I continue to urge local authorities to operate the scheme in a flexible and responsive manner having regard to the needs of the applicants.</P>

      <P>The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002 announced in July 2000. Given the priority afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include the Ballygawley scheme in the programme.</P>
      <P>It is open to the council to consider advancing the scheme under the devolved rural water programme.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme will operate this year from 1 June to 30 September. It is targeted at students from low income families who are participating in third level courses and who, under existing legislation, cannot apply for unemployment assistance during the summer months.</P>
      <P>This year, in order to give extra assistance to less well off students, an additional £1 per hour will be paid to those students whose parents are dependent on social welfare payments. This will allow them to earn an extra £200 if they work the maximum number of hours allowed under the scheme, giving them a total payment of £800 for 200 hours work. Demand for the scheme has dropped off significantly in the past few years which reflects the wider availability of summer jobs for students.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to increase the general £3 per hour payment under this year's scheme. It would be inadvisable to do this in a tightening job market situation when demand for labour is high, especially during the busy summer period.</P>

Under the Agreement, Waterways Ireland has been charged with responsibility for the management, maintenance and development, principally for recreational purposes, of the Shannon-Erne waterway, the Erne system, the Grand Canal, including the Barrow navigation, the Lower Bann navigation, the Royal Canal and the Shannon navigation. In addition, it is responsible for taking forward appropriate studies and appraisals in relation to the possible restoration of the Ulster Canal. Since the setting up of the body in December 1999, Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, no longer has any responsibility for canals and waterways development and maintenance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 to 119, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Waterways Ireland was set up as one of the six implementation bodies under the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999. Its co-sponsoring Departments are the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in the South and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure or DCAL in the North.</P>
      <P>In the Revised Estimates for the Public Service, 2001, Waterways Ireland received £22.174 million. Waterways Ireland is obliged to present its annual report and accounts to the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly by the end of June. The body is also accountable to the offices of the Comptroller and Auditor General, both North and South. The body is required to bring all major proposals to the waterways sectoral North-South Ministerial Council. The next such meeting is due to take place on 27 June.</P>
      <P>On a day-to-day basis the North-South co-operation division of my Department liaises with Waterways Ireland and DCAL. Currently Waterways Ireland submits all of its claims to my Department and they are paid from the Vote. Such payment requests are subject to the same checks as any other payments made by my Department. This position will change in 2002 when Waterways Ireland has its full staffing complement. I am satisfied that the procedures in place are adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation bodies, including Waterways Ireland, are not subject to freedom of information legislation in the South. However, the British-Irish Agreement provided that an FOI code of practice would be prepared for approval by the North-South Ministerial Council. The Department of Finance has submitted a draft set <Col N="448" /> of principles for such a code to the northern side and is awaiting a response.</P>
    <P>Departmental papers in the South relating to the body are subject to the FOI Act and applications for information may be made in the usual manner.</P>

Effect is given to that convention in Irish law by the Maintenance Act, 1994.

      <P>I am further informed that the gardaí at Clontarf then made contact with the gardaí at Pearse Street station. The superintendent of Pearse Street station was immediately notified of the fact, and daily contact at detective inspector level was maintained between both districts on all aspects of the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A press release was issued by the Garda Press Office on 15 May 2001, a missing persons report <Col N="450" /> was forwarded and the matter was circulated by telex to all Garda stations nationwide. A trace was placed on the subject's mobile phone and his bank accounts were monitored. Twenty video tapes from the vicinity were secured and examined by the investigating gardaí. Posters were placed throughout the city centre by the Garda Síochána and by family members, and the Garda Crimeline office was contacted with a view to ensuring maximum media coverage. All gardaí within the Dublin metropolitan region were made aware of the subject's disappearance and, in particular, the gardaí at Pearse Street station, from whose area the person in question had gone missing.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the body of the person in question was discovered on 30 May 2001 in the basement at the rear of a financial institution on Grafton Street-Suffolk Street.

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the situation where, in some third level institutions, full-time technicians do not enjoy pension rights or sick pay and are limited to stage nine of a 14 point incremental stage; and if he will investi gate the reason these technicians are not appointed on a permanent basis despite their long service.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question relates to technicians in the technological sector.</P>
      <P>Institutes of technology are statutory bodies established under the Dublin Institute of Technology Acts, 1992 and 1994, and the Regional Technical Colleges Acts, 1992 to 1999. Under those Acts, the governance and day-to-day activities of the institutes are matters for which the governing body and the management staff of the institutes are responsible. I have no statutory function in relation to the appointment, whether temporary or permanent, of an individual to a post. This is a matter for individual institutes.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to pension entitlements is that technicians employed in a permanent whole-time capacity are eligible for admission to the relevant pension scheme. These entitlements are not currently enjoyed by temporary whole-time technicians. However, my Department is currently reviewing the situation.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware that, in relation to sick pay for temporary wholetime technicians, different practices apply in individual institutes. As a result, my Department is reviewing the situation. I expect the review to be completed shortly. I anticipate that the outcome of the review will result in the issuing of guidelines on sick pay entitlements for temporary wholetime technicians.</P>
      <P>The position on incremental progression is that technicians employed on a temporary whole-time basis are granted annual increments up to a specified limit on the salary scale. However, the position has been reviewed in my Department and revised arrangements will shortly issue to institutes which will remove the limit.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 133, 152 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the schools on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>Sanction of the appointment of the fourth mainstream class teacher under maximum class size guidelines for the 2000-01 school year was given in September 2000. However, as accommodation was not available, the post was not filled.</P>
      <P>The staff warranted for the 2001-02 school year includes a principal and four mainstream class teachers. In addition, the school retains the services of a shared learning support teacher for the coming school year.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of the appointment of a resource teacher, my Department sanctioned 7.5 hours part-time resource support to cater for the special needs pupils enrolled in the school in question.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate has been requested to investigate the feasibility of allocating a full-time resource post to a cluster of schools in the Castlecomer area, including St. Patrick's national school. The resource teacher needs of St. Patrick's national school will be considered in this context.</P>
      <P>An application for permanent accommodation was received by my Department in April 2001. This is being examined in the planning and building unit of my Department and a response will be issued to the board of management of the school as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application for temporary school accommo<Col N="455" /> dation was received in my Department last month. The provision of one classroom in temporary accommodation has been approved and the school authorities have been advised to engage the services of a local consultant to prepare the necessary documentation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider it to be a matter of absolute importance that schools and my Department, where relevant, should act quickly and effectively in dealing with any cases involving allegations of child sexual abuse. The precise action to be taken in any given case will depend on the circumstances of that case and the guidelines, which have been issued by my Department and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children published new national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children, Children First, in September 1999. These guidelines are an important step in strengthening arrangements for the protection of children. The Children First guidelines place an onus on statutory and voluntary or community organisations to draw up local guidelines to complement Children First and to make them as effective and meaningful as possible.</P>
      <P>As a follow-up to the Children First guidelines, my Department has issued new child protection guidelines and procedures to all primary schools. These child protection guidelines and procedures have been developed following an extensive consultation and discussion process with the partners in education and a representative from the health boards. They were issued to primary schools in a set containing a copy of Children First.</P>
      <P>These child protection guidelines and procedures replace the guidelines entitled Procedures for Dealing with Allegations or Suspicions of Child Abuse which were issued to all primary schools in 1991. They are based on the Children First guidelines, but have been specifically developed with the primary school setting in mind. The intention of the new guidelines and procedures is to give direction and guidance to all school management authorities and school personnel in identifying, reporting and dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse. In particular, they emphasise the obligation on school authorities to ensure allegations or suspicions are reported to the health authorities and-or the Garda.</P>
      <P>While these guidelines are aimed at the primary school sector, they will be used as a basis for agreeing similar guidelines in the post-primary sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures to be followed by my Department where an allegation of abuse is received are set out in an internal instruction of 1995. Where <Col N="459" /> the allegation relates to a teacher, the procedure requires that the appropriate school authorities be notified by the Department. My Department then monitors the response of the school. While the allegation is being investigated, my Department's position is that the teacher in question should be directed by the school authorities to vacate his or her post pending the outcome of the inquiry. In such cases, my Department provides for paid substitution.</P>
    <P>Where evidence of child sexual abuse has been proven against a teacher in a court of law that person should not be engaged in any capacity in a school. My Department will take whatever action is necessary, subject to due process, to ensure that this is so if such cases come to our attention. The Teaching Council, which will be established under the recently enacted Teaching Council Act, 2001, will, together with the High Court, have regulatory functions in respect of teachers who have misconducted themselves in this way. This will provide further safeguards to children.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I and my Department consider that the care, welfare and safety of children in schools is of paramount concern in cases where allegations, proven or otherwise, are made against teachers or other school staff.</P>

      <P>Two of the families in question reside closer to another school, and, accordingly, their children are not eligible for school transport. The third family resides 1.2 miles from the route of service to the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a <Col N="460" /> pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the current arrangement is the most that can be offered by my Department.</P>

      <P>The board of management of each primary school is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated, while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption-free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</P>
      <P>Every pupil has the right to access the full range of curricular subjects and boards of management and staffs of schools should ensure that the full curriculum is delivered to all pupils. The cancelling of any curricular area as a form of administering discipline is not appropriate.</P>

      <P>Among the factors considered by my Department, prior to approving capital projects are the following: the extent of the overall capital allocation for school buildings; the requirements of an existing school or a developing area based on demographic projections; the fundamental reason for the project  &ndash; for example, amalgamation, upgrading of existing accommodation, green-field site school in developing area; the estimated delivery date for the project; the scale of the proposed development as expressed in area and pupil numbers; the estimated cost of the proposed development; the availability of alternative accommodation solutions; the necessity for a site acquisition; the age and condition of existing buildings; the length of time from the initial application; the presence of an effective maintenance programme and the effective use at primary level of the devolved grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The way in which my Department provides caretaking resources to second level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges, community and comprehensive schools and voluntary secondary schools.</P>
      <P>Voluntary secondary schools with enrolments of 200 or more in the free education scheme receive grants towards the cost of caretaking services under the PESP scheme. These grants are paid in addition to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant. 365 secondary schools are in receipt of grants &ndash; some 87% of the total number of voluntary secondary schools, including fee-paying schools. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, non-teaching staff allocations, including caretakers, are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme-wide basis. The way in which staffing is allocated to schools is a matter for each committee in line with their priorities and perceptions of need. My Department has made provision for caretaking services for all VEC schools with enrolments in excess of 200 pupils &ndash; some 79% of the total number of VEC schools, i.e. 247. All 85 schools in the community and comprehensive sector, have the services of one or more caretakers, the full salary costs of which are met by my Department.</P>
      <P>In addition to the funding arrangements outlined above, schools at second level now also receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. Provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position at primary level is that my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of secretaries and caretakers, under which my Depart<Col N="464" /> ment meets the full cost of salary and PRSI. Under this scheme, there were 205 full-time caretaker posts on 1 January 2001. However, as some of the posts are shared between two or more schools, there are actually 248 schools with a service under this scheme. This represents 7.5% of a total of 3,293 primary schools.</P>
    <P>The 1978-79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
    <P>The PESP scheme provides additional<i> per-capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard<i> per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional<i> per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed. All primary schools not already in receipt of funding under the 1978-79 scheme, or 92.5% of schools, are included in the PESP scheme.</P>
    <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil, with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum, which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, was increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will be further increased this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the phasing out of community employment schemes in schools. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as CE schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department, thereby ensuring an equitable and uniform system of funding for such services.</P>
