      <P>Section 11(1) of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, makes provision for the appointment of special advisers to my office. As provided for in section 11(3) of the Act, the terms and conditions of these appointments are subject to determination by the Minister for Finance. Excluding orders to cover the terms of these posts are requested from the Civil Service Commission, as required, by the Department of Finance.</P>

    <P>In regard to the appointments I have made as special advisers, the following are the details of those who currently assist me in dealing with the complexities and volume of Government business.<Col N="2" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will any of these advisers be involved in the Fianna Fáil general election campaign? If that is the Taoiseach's intention, will they resign in advance of the campaign from the positions they hold at present as civil servants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet given any thought to the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>We believe the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal procedure will be followed. I presume that if advisers are active and <Col N="3" /> working full time for Fianna Fáil during the day they cannot be Government advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is normal does not necessarily apply, as we found out on Question Time last week. The Taoiseach is already using civil servants in his communications unit for political purposes. Does the Taoiseach intend using his special advisers, who are now public servants, as party activists in the course of the general election campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not. To reiterate what I said last week, the civil servants who work in the information unit are not providing a political function to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we will have to ask the question a few more times before we get a definitive answer.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago when the Taoiseach was asked about the purchase by the State of the Battle of the Boyne site he confirmed that one of his political advisers had been involved in his private capacity in the course of the £8 million deal. Because of the many questions which remain unanswered about this issue, does the Taoiseach now agree that it is unwise for people who advise him in the manner he has described in his answer to be also involved privately in business where there could be, or where it could be made to seem there is, a conflict of interest, especially when so much taxpayers' money is involved? Will the Taoiseach discontinue this practice in respect of his current advisers and make this part of the terms and conditions of their employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Civil Service advisers, a protocol, that is a draft Civil Service code on standards and behaviour, is being developed by the Department of Finance. It has been laid before the House and has been referred to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. Provision is being made in that code to include its applicability to the various posts which are set out in it. That is before the House. Political advisers or advisers to the Government are also answerable under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, the application of which is overseen by the Public Offices Commission. They will be covered by the new code as well as by the Ethics in Public Office Act.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other issue raised by Deputy Noonan, I stated that the person involved in the Battle of the Boyne site was a friend of mine, not a political adviser. He has been a friend of mine for 20 to 25 years. He is not a political adviser and he has never worked for me, either in a voluntary or public capacity. He is not a civil servant but is involved in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In today's world it would be far better if people well known to one were not involved in anything. I was surprised when I discovered the person in <Col N="4" /> question was involved in that issue. I said that to the Deputy two weeks ago and I repeat it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach advise the House that those listed as his advisers in one capacity or another are not engaged in any outside business activity which is an undeclared conflict of interest or could be deemed to be one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my understanding. They must make full and detailed declarations, the arbiter of which is part of the remit of the Public Office Commission. To the best of my knowledge, none of them has great material needs, other than one who is a part-time farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Taoiseach's brief did not contain information on the full cost of the communications unit, especially regarding the salaries of the civil servants seconded from other Departments. Does he have this information now and will he indicate the annual salary of each of the persons mentioned in his original reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that information has been forwarded. I did not have it last week and I appreciate the Deputy's comment to that effect. I sent him a letter with the details. I have not got the information with me. It is not relevant to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, questions were submitted by Deputy Quinn and I concerning the same issue. Deputy Quinn's question specifically requested details of the budget of the communications unit. The Taoiseach outlined the cost of the unit to his Department but he did not include the salaries of the civil servants seconded to the Department. In the letter he sent to me this was detailed as an additional cost of £169,000 per annum. Over a five year period that amounts to a significant sum. It constitutes the main cost of the unit. Is it the case that, again, the Taoiseach does not have information on the cost of the salaries of these advisers? If not, will he look at his brief and read out their annual salaries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan should table a specific question on that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Sir, it is a legitimate supplementary question.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair decides what is a legitimate supplementary question. There is no reference to salaries in Question No. 1, which is concerned with the names of advisers and their duties. The correct procedure for the Deputy is to table a specific question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us in the House have been Ministers and we know what is contained in <Col N="5" /> a brief to parliamentary questions. We know civil servants normally include the material which allows Ministers answer questions about costs. That is a given. I am asking the Taoiseach to read out the annual salaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can help the Chair. I understood Deputy Noonan to be concerned with last week's question. He asked me if I now had information he requested last week. I assumed he was concerned about the information I promptly forwarded to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very unusual for annual salaries to have pence, so I take it the Taoiseach has given the amounts paid to these advisers so far in this calendar year, or has he given their annual salaries? It sounds like the amount paid to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

There was a report to the effect the letter had not been sent or received, and a spokesperson for the Taoiseach was quoted as saying this to <i>The Irish Times</i> on 5 October last, even though the letter had been delivered to Government Buildings on 4 October.

That was the charge made, and I want you to confirm to the House that the fault was on your side, that your spokesperson either intentionally or unintentionally briefed the press incorrectly.

      <P>Deputy Noonan was making the point, as I recall it, that the letter had gone over and that somebody in the Government press office was saying it had not. If it is that important to the Deputy, I will go back and check it again. I just accepted what he said. I do not go around my Department checking on letters which may not have reached their destination. However, if it is that important, I will check it. I said, on the day, that I accepted the Deputy's position when he said, as Leader of the Opposition, that he had sent the letter over. If he wishes me to conduct an investigation and to check which of the two ushers at the tunnel or which staff member in the corridors might have delayed the process of delivery, I will do so.

It is a matter for the Taoiseach as to how he manages his office and what internal procedures apply. What I am asking the Taoiseach is a much more serious question &ndash; who briefed <i>The Irish Times</i>, categorically, that the letter had not been sent from the Leader of the Opposition when it had? Is it the custom and practice in his office to brief on that basis, without checking whether a letter had arrived?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>A change management unit has been established to support the implementation of the modernisation programme for my Department and progress is being made on a number of fronts. As I indicated in my response on 3 July, performance indicators for the modernisation programme have been drawn up and forwarded to the Civil Service quality assurance group.</P>
      <P>In relation to business planning, the strategy statement for the period 2001-03 is due to be published shortly. The divisional business planning process is embedded within the overall management process of the Department and links are being developed with individual staff objectives as the performance management and development system is implemented. All staff have attended a presentation on the performance management system and comprehensive training courses are ongoing. As a further support for staff, career development training is currently under way, focusing on the development of the core competencies identified for the Department.</P>
      <P>A customer action plan for 2001-04 has been published and made available on my Department's website. Customer surveys were carried out in June 2000 and March 2001 and the results have informed the new action plan. A summary of the survey results has been published with the plan. My Department has been involved in providing central co-ordination and impetus to the Information Society and e-public service agenda. Internally, it has prepared its e-strategy and is engaged in a number of e-government projects, notably the e-Cabinet project and the upgrading of the website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work is under way on a number of human resource management initiatives, including the reorientation of the human resource function, the upgrading of training facilities and the development of an integrated human resource strategy and staff development plan. A survey will be issued to all staff shortly as part of the consulta<Col N="10" /> tive process for the plan. In addition, a gender equality policy for the Department has been agreed as part of the partnership process and circulated to all staff.</P>
    <P>My Department is among the leading Departments in implementing the new management information framework. Phase 1 of the project, the formulation of a comprehensive implementation strategy, was completed in March 2000. Additional resources, including a professional accountant, were assigned in October 2000. Phase 2 of the project is now under way, whereby a new financial management computer system has been selected and is expected to be implemented by June 2002. The approach used by my Department has since been adopted as a model by a number of other Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the report of the Information Commissioner which was published last summer? It criticises civil servants for not keeping adequate records. For example, despite a year-long fraud investigation in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, no records were kept about the investigation. The Information Commissioner was also critical of certain doctors in public employ not keeping medical records which were relevant to their patients. Is that report being examined by the strategic management committee with a view to ensuring that the records which are necessary for the proper running of the public services are kept?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the details of the issues raised because they are not part of the work in which I am involved. However, the strategic management initiative in the Departments which would cover those areas is trying to create an environment where not alone are records and facts kept, but they are kept in the most efficient way. It is also seeking to ensure that Departments use modern technology and performance indicators, are keeping abreast of the modernisation programme and are giving quality assurances to customers. As part of that process, the initiative is endeavouring to bring with it the staff and recruitment functions, appointment systems and all other areas that make up the normal clerical aspects of a Civil Service Department so there will be modern streamlined systems.</P>
      <P>That is what SMI is endeavouring to do and there are a number of sub-committees working on these issues. I will mention the matters raised by the Deputy. They are not within the remit of my Department but I am sure they are issues the committee is examining.</P>

      <P>The public. My Department, like all Departments, published a new customer <Col N="11" /> action plan for the years 2001 to 2004. A survey of external customers was carried out in March to monitor customer service levels. It covered all users, including other agencies. In addition, all employees will shortly be invited to respond to a survey which will include questions relating to internal customer service, which are the services within the Department. The customer information referral system is being used to look at the people who use the Department and the public generally.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of a report on the Revenue Commissioners by the Oireachtas committee on strategic management which recommended that persons who are out of pocket due to mistakes by the Revenue Commissioners should be compensated? Does the Taoiseach agree with this proposal and what steps is he taking to ensure that such a scheme is put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report's recommendation regarding members of the public who are left short over a period because of errors, faults or difficulties. They could be surcharged if the positions were reversed. They should therefore not be forced to suffer by reason of neglect on the part of Revenue. There have been cases brought to the notice of SMI and cases raised by the staff on the issues of marketing and other issues within the Departments. As regards issues in the Department of Finance, I am not aware of what will happen. I think there is a case because I am aware of cases where somebody could be out of pocket for a substantial amount of money for a considerable length of time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the case has been made but it is a matter for the Minister for Finance.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the House in May, the OECD report on &ldquo;Regulatory Reform in Ireland&rdquo; both records the good progress which has been made in certain areas of regulatory reform and highlights areas where further actions are needed. I am glad to report that considerable progress has been made in recent months in terms of implementation of the recommendations of the report. Last May, I told the House that a high level group on regulation was being established to give greater coherence in implementing &ldquo;better regulation&rdquo; measures across the full spectrum of Government activities. The group has met on five occasions so far this year, and is expected to make its first interim report to the Government in early January.</P>
      <P>The group comprises representatives of key Departments, independent sectoral regulators and agencies and offices with a particular interest and role in regulation such as Forfás the Competition Authority and the Director of Consumer Affairs. The group has identified two major tasks. A public consultation document is being prepared which will be the starting point for a wide public consultation process which will promote dialogue, greater public awareness of regulatory reform and better regulation. The group hopes to finalise a consultation document in early January with a view to commencing the public consultation phase in February. It is intended that this process will lead to an over-arching policy statement on &ldquo;Better Regulation&rdquo;, perhaps ultimately in the form of a Government White Paper.</P>
      <P>The policy statement will gather together the strands of the better regulation-regulatory reform agenda and set out the core principles which should govern what gets regulated and how areas of economic and social life are best regulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second main issue identified by the group is the need to develop a system of regulatory impact assessment. The group's work in this area <Col N="13" /> is intended to address one of the main criticisms made by the OECD in its report &ndash; namely the need for a systematic, rigorous assessment of proposed regulations before they are enacted. In common with many other OECD and EU countries, this will mean developing a system of impact assessment to ensure that we properly consider alternatives to regulation and legislation and that, where legislation is necessary, we seek to quantify in a systematic way the likely economic and social impacts of regulatory proposals.</P>
    <P>Any model of regulatory impact assessment that is developed for introduction in Departments must assist the quality of regulation and must not slow the legislative process. The ultimate benefit of impact analysis will be to avoid inappropriate regulations and to minimise both unintended effects and undue burdens of compliance on individual citizens and consumers, on businesses &ndash; especially small businesses &ndash; and on markets. There will need to be significant training for policy makers in respect of the application of whatever assessment model is developed.</P>
    <P>In addition to these two major tasks, the group is also monitoring progress on particular regulatory issues, including the ongoing reviews of specific regulations in sectors such as pharmacy services and liquor licensing. The Competition Authority has also embarked on its own study of professional services. While these are the highlights of the group's work to date, all Departments have been asked to consider fully the implications of the OECD report within their respective areas of responsibility and, where appropriate, take action to ensure better regulation for their customers, for the economy and for society in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The OECD report, which is the subject of these questions, was published in April last and the Government responded by setting up the implementation group. I put it to the Taoiseach that he is aware the OECD report included criticisms of pubs, pharmacies and the electricity and gas services. It strongly recommended that these areas should be subject to deregulation. Has the Taoiseach a view on the deregulation of the aforementioned bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been Government action on a number of these areas. All of the sectoral areas mentioned by Deputy Noonan are in the first instance the concern of individual Ministers who have already answered specific questions on these issues.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children has spoken on pharmacy deregulation. A working group on liquor licensing has published its first report and is shortly to publish its second report. Likewise with the issues of telecommunications, energy and transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the terms of reference for the review of the pharmacy sector has been agreed and the first meeting of the group established by the Minister for Health and Children, chaired by <Col N="14" /> Dr. Mortell, formerly of UCC, has taken place. An advertisement was placed regarding his submissions on this issue and on the operation of the regulations, and the review is ongoing. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already set up a review on which he gave a detailed account on 25 October last.</P>
    <P>With regard to telecommunications, Deputy Noonan will be aware that the regulatory functions were transferred to the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulations in June 1997. The OECD report on regulatory reform concluded that unbundling the local loop would be an important step in upgrading the telecommunications network. While the regulatory framework to do this is now in place, the take-up is still at a very early stage due to the cost related issues. In August, the Director of Telecommunications Regulations set out the minimum criteria for the handling of customer complaints by telecom operators.</P>
    <P>Energy is a matter for the Minister for Public Enterprise and the issues relating to the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, on the internal market and the various directives on the new regulatory regime have been established. The Electricity (Supply) Amendment Bill, 2001, provided for full liberalisation and the new bodies and structures operate under the Commission for Electricity Regulation. The Eirgrid energy transmission system is now designed to facilitate competition. On these areas as well as in transport and others, action is ongoing and the work of the committees will feed into them as they proceed. The committee hopes that, in addition to the areas about which Deputy Noonan has asked, it will address these areas simultaneously because they were mentioned by the OECD. It is also drafting a national policy statement on regulatory management for these and other areas.</P>
    <P>As I said in my earlier reply, it is also setting up a regulatory impact analysis group. I attended a meeting of this group recently and its interim report should be available next January. It will take some time to do that work but this will not delay work on the more pressing issues that have been highlighted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the group address the issue of consistency of the various regulators within the offices in its interim report? In addition will it consider the merits of having an integrated office of regulation, having regard to the relatively small size of the economy and the need for consistency, both in procedures and in thinking, as well as the lack of resources and the delays being caused in certain sectors?</P>
      <P>When will the group dealing with pharmacies, to which the Taoiseach referred in his reply, report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter has been discussed in the House a number of times. A number of regulators are sitting on the committee and it is their hope, on the basis of the meeting I <Col N="15" /> attended and briefing material I have read, that the committee will maintain standards and play a full role in this group, even though there are different EU regulations for the various sectors in terms of conducting a regulatory impact analysis. I cannot guarantee, given the different legislation and regulatory regimes, that the committee will achieve that. However, the committee is independent and while it has various remits, it will, I hope, help to achieve that.</P>
      <P>On the issue of pharmacies, the committee chaired by Dr. Mortell set itself a target of one year to complete its work. I am not sure when it started but it was not long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the current restrictions on the licensed trade and the pharmaceutical sector allow them to operate effectively as a cartel? Deregulation is required but, on the other hand, if the Groceries Order was abolished and the retail trade deregulated, many small shops and producers would suffer badly. Are those sectors to be dealt with in different ways?</P>
      <P>Has the Government agreed a position in regard to the timescale for reporting on the implementation of deregulation of liquor licensing and pharmacies, in particular? The Tánaiste stated in April that the matter could be reported on within a few months or certainly by the end of the year, while the Taoiseach was reported as saying it would be reported on before the end of 2002. Has the Government a clear line on this issue as those two positions are at variance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first question, there are difficulties. The Competition Authority is examining the professional services. Pharmacies, liquor licences, telecommunications, energy and transport are ones to which I have referred. The OECD report pointed out that Ireland is well advanced for a small country in many of these areas but once one touches any of them, there are difficulties because the implementation of deregulation creates difficulties for the sectors involved. That is why vested interests in these sectors must be given the opportunity to argue their case. The Deputy will be aware they do so trenchantly. They will outline how deregulation would affect them and work against the consumer. They appear to have good arguments in some cases but if one accepted all the arguments one would not do anything.</P>
      <P>If one looks back over the past decade, an enormous amount of legislation has been passed by the House in the area of deregulation, which has set new ground rules and regulated new sectors. The work programme set down by the regulators, Forfás and the other agencies and Departments for the first five meetings is enormous and their work will go on for the next decade. None of these sectors will be dealt with easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business issued an excellent report on the Groceries Order, which was laid before the <Col N="16" /> House, and it found favour with a majority outside the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to pharmacies, the committee set a target of one year from the time work commenced. To the best of my knowledge it commenced last August.</P>
    <P>On liquor licences, an interdepartmental group has been established to progress recommendations made in the report of the Commission on Liquor Licensing. It initially reported to the Government in June and is expected to report again by 31 January 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The review group, comprising Mr. Bill Attley, Mr. John Dunne and Mr. Kevin Bonner, which reported to me on 4 July on Iarnród Éireann: The Way Forward, indicated that there are major questions to be addressed with regard to the future of the rail freight business.</P>
      <P>The review group set out a number of arguments in favour of, and against, retaining freight services generally. In this regard, it recommended that a special and thorough study of the issue be commissioned as a matter of urgency. In addition, the review group suggested that long range plans need to be established for the rail sector as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware the boards of Iarnród Éireann and CIÉ are considering a business plan for the rail freight sector for 2001 to 2006 arising from commercial losses being incurred. They have forwarded a copy to me for my information. They are in the process of having discussions with the trade unions on the plan. I understand that no decisions have been taken in that regard. Furthermore, I understand that Iarnród Éireann is working on a business plan for the rail sector as a whole. We will commission a strategic study of the rail sector in line with the report of the three wise men, Iarnród Éireann &ndash; The Way Forward. This study will assess the CIE proposals and take account of the various other rail proposals which arise from land use studies being undertaken around the country. This study will also assess the rail freight proposals. It is intended to discuss the terms of reference for the proposed study with <Col N="18" /> CIE and the social partners at the partnership forum on public transport.</P>
    <P>EU funding of approximately £196 million &ndash; 249 million &ndash; is provided in the rail development programme set out in the national development plan for the upgrading and renewal of suburban and mainline rail services. No provision has been made for re-opening of passenger or freight lines. The decision by Iarnród Éireann to close the Kingscourt to Tara Mines rail line following the loss of the Tara Mines business is a matter of day-to-day responsibility of the board.</P>

        <b>: </b>Is the strategic study yet another means of putting this on the long finger to tide the Minister over until the next election? As the main shareholder, is the Minister prepared to stand over the decision to cut the number of employees working in the transportation of freight from 600 to 300? At a time when 6,000 new cars come on to the roads each week, convoys of juggernauts take over the roads and there is a huge increase in the number of road accident fatalities, is it not incredible that a proposal to cut freight is even contemplated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of proposing a cut in the numbers employed in Iarnród Éireann's freight business or in the amount of freight carried. I have made it very clear this was a proposal comprising for and against arguments. The board has taken no decision. I have spoken to the chairman about it informally because it is not my job to interfere in an actual decision. I fully agree with the Deputy that it is odd, when we are trying to reduce traffic on the roads, that additional heavy goods traffic would be put on the network. I do not think the plan is proper or that there would be a proposal of any kind to take freight from the railways. Iarnród Éireann's job is to look at where it is losing money and find what case it can make for a sustainable freight business. In every European country, freight is being moved more and more by rail and it does not make sense to say that we will take it from the railways and put it on the roads.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I thank the Minister for her reply. If this plan comes to the Minister, is she, as the main shareholder, prepared to veto it? Does the plan not reveal a manifest lack of marketing skills and competence on the part of the company? Why would it contemplate this at a time when there are many opportunities in the market and a willingness on the part of private industry to use railways? Most of Europe is now moving the transport of freight from road to railways. It is incredible that the company would not exploit the many existing opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it requires a short-term subsidy, would the Department of Public Enterprise be prepared to make the necessary finance available to put a proper marketing strategy in place and avail of the many opportunities? Is the Minister aware that this is more than something that has just been <Col N="19" /> mooted? I have discussed this with the managing director and this is something that is in the pipeline. Will the Minister give a categorical assurance that, if this plan comes before her for final ratification or sanction, she will not countenance it and will veto it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>To return to the first point, it is proper for any company to look at where it is losing money. In this case there are areas of Iarnród Éireann's freight business that are losing heavily. The company has not yet taken a decision. I have been informed that it has discussed the matter and it is to come back for further discussion.</P>
      <P>It is clear there is corporate governance in Iarnród Éireann and there is a line over which the Minister does not step. The company is in receipt of significant annual subvention which increases yearly. The 2002 Estimates indicate the subvention will be further increased. How CIE chooses to divide its money is a matter, by law, for the company. Iarnród Éireann should look at each business it deals with and offer further services. I cannot see myself being in favour of taking freight from the railways and putting it on the roads. A proper business plan must be put in place.</P>

      <P>I assure the House that Irish efforts to achieve the maximum support for Aer Lingus from the European Commission have been continuous and unremitting since the Transport Council on 16 October 2001. I have outlined to the House my efforts in the build-up to that Council. I have met the Secretary General and other senior officials in my Department on almost a daily basis since 16 October to review the Aer Lingus situation and under my direction specific action was put in train. On 17 October, the Taoiseach met President Prodi and the full Commission and outlined the Aer Lingus difficulties. A host of different meetings and actions have also taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is keeping all competition and State aid rules and regulations under review in conjunction with the Attorney General's office. We have also engaged on a consultancy basis the <Col N="20" /> services of a former senior official from the Competition Directorate of the European Commission to advise us in this area. My Department will be in a position to make a comprehensive case in respect of any proposal for investment in Aer Lingus which the Government may wish to make to the European Commission.

      <P>Given that the Minister and the Government disagree with the Commissioner's interpretation of the state aid rule and believe that she is wrong in that interpretation, why does the Minister not make the payment to Aer Lingus that is required and let it be tested in court? Would the Minister consider that route?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Testing a matter in court is a lengthy process, whether it is a European court or a court here. It is far better to proceed as we have done which is by careful study, by engaging the services of a former Commission official and by maintaining our contacts. Next week there is a Transport Council meeting when we will meet bilaterally with four or five ministers who we have identified as also preparing cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in 1993 Deputy Cowen, then Minister for Public Enterprise, met the Commissioner as I did, in March of that year. The Commission decision was made on 21 <Col N="21" /> December 1993. Even before things became tight and spiky it was a nine month process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that all the talking could be done after the payment was made if the Minister was of a mind to do so, bearing in mind that the court case could be in five or seven years' time and the matter could well be resolved by then? Would the Minister take a leaf out of the Italian Government's book? Without reference to the Commission, it paid a large subsidy directly to its airline when it suddenly got into trouble last week. Does the Minister agree that if the Government was serious about saving Aer Lingus and keeping it as a public company it would do the same as the Italian and Belgian governments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>It has ended up sadly for the Belgians because their airline has ceased trading in its normal format. That intrusion into the Commission's business did not work very well. The Italian minister and I had discussions at the last Council meeting about Alitalia. Deputy Stagg's assertions are inaccurate. They have decided to do something but they have not yet done it. I intend to speak to him next week. He was one of the ministers who was vocal with other ministers and in public. The Deputy suggested that if the court case took five to seven years, it would not matter because the money would already have been put in. That is no way to do our business. The way we are going about this is careful and it is the correct way.</P>

I maintain regular contact with the chairman in relation to the situation in Aer Lingus and he keeps me fully briefed on the position of the board on all relevant matters. I met him early this morning for further discussions. There is a meeting of the board this Thursday and there will likely be one on 8 December. As the House is already aware, very sensitive negotiations have been taking place over the last two weeks on the survival plan. With the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, Aer Lingus management and unions agreed a process and a timetable for discussions on the survival plan on the understanding that these discussions will end no later than tomorrow, 28 November 2001, with voting to take place between then and 7 December 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essential components of the plan are the voluntary redundancy programme and early retire<Col N="22" /> ment scheme announced last week for which £40 million &ndash; 50.79 million &ndash; will be made available by the company through the sale of aircraft and borrowings. The other main element of the survival plan is the essential restructuring of the airline so as to establish a robust, flexible business model which will ensure long-term viability, thereby safeguarding the remaining 4,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate the commencement of staff voting on a full package relating to the survival plan, the LRC must conclude its deliberations and produce its report on the matter by tomorrow. I understand that the LRC is on track to meet this deadline.</P>

The first was a commitment that pay rises would be repaid when the airline turns around given that it is anticipated it will be 2003 before a profit is made. Second was the indexation of pensions and full redundancy being offered to all employees even after 36 years' service. The Minister may have seen large newspaper advertisements placed by SIPTU.

      <P>I saw the large advertisement in yesterday's paper which stated that the Government should match the £40 million which Aer Lingus has borrowed. Apart from the 5% which is owned by the workers, the Government is the main stakeholder on behalf of the people so they would be backing the £40 million which is being raised by using the airline's aircraft as collateral.</P>

I urge them to give the matter very careful consideration. It is clear from the conversation I had with the chairman this morning, which I have reported to the Taoiseach, that matters remain serious within Aer Lingus.

      <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter in the first instance for the companies. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of telecommunications policy. Various initiatives have taken place under the National Development Plan 1994-1999. A sum of 26 million or £20 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled out broadband nationwide were supported and are now nearing completion. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, £157 million has been allocated to promote and co-fund further roll-outs in rural and underdeveloped areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nine contracts worth £44 million were signed with five companies in early 2001 and a second call for proposals is now being considered. A total of 31 proposals have been received, 20 of which are applications made by local authorities or public bodies. The other 11 are from private sector <Col N="24" /> companies. The deadline for receipt of expressions of interest in an Atlantic broadband corridor was 31 October 2001. My officials are currently evaluating the expressions of interest received.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>Although SMEs were not specifically targeted under the call for proposals, local authorities and communications companies were encouraged to consult all local businesses and organisations before making a project proposal to ascertain their communications requirements. My Department also announced a call for proposals for pilot trials of VSAT (very small aperture terminals) satellite terminals to deliver broadband access in a number of diverse user communities around the country. This closed at the end of August 2000.</P>
    <P>The aims of the pilot project were to test the deployment of VSAT technology as a means for providing broadband access to serve diverse types of users such as educational establishments, the agriculture sector, SMEs and Gaeltacht regions and to assess the feasibility of providing broadband infrastructure to remote communities using VSAT technology. Contracts were signed with three organisations. With the assistance of grants awarded by the Department of Public Enterprise these groups are working to install and maintain 87 VSAT terminals to provide high-speed Internet access to schools, libraries, small businesses and community centres throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>In an additional initiative a study was undertaken on behalf of my Department to consider options for addressing certain communications infrastructure gaps throughout the country and to promote competition and reduce the price of broadband services to business and residential users in the west. On foot of this study I sought expressions of interest in designing, building, operating and managing a seamless, world class, high speed telecommunications network linking the north-west to the south-west with inter-connectivity to existing national networks.</P>

I do not roll out local loop unbundling. The telecoms regulator, Etain Doyle, is now responsible. I understand that the companies are currently in contention with the regulator about various aspects of her proposed pricing regime.</P>
      <P>With regard to the OECD study, I draw the Deputy's attention to a recent European study which ranked Ireland's the best Government in Europe. One can take one's pick from surveys. I hope our political surveys do not turn out the same way. I will send the Deputy a copy. I have read the other one too, but this one, which was printed in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Friday, states that Ireland is the best country in Europe in terms of advances in broadband technology. The Deputy has his survey and I have mine.</P>

      <P>It is also a matter for the State. At present NTL has not yet launched its DSL service and Eircom's is by far the most expensive service in the 30 OECD countries. It is not just a matter for private companies. The State should take an active role in the provision of this infrastructure, as has happened in Sweden and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>I will put forward a proposal for the Minister's consideration. Along with the Atlantic broadband corridor and a possible corridor from Belfast to Cork, the use of the CIE signalling network, which also uses fibre-optic cable, could be considered as a State service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not intend to use the CIE signalling network. It can be left to other people to deal with if they want to. There have been enough difficulties in that regard.

We have made a change in the roll-out for 19 October which will be announced before Christmas and we are giving 90% grant aid, which is an increase from the previous 55% or 60%. We believe that the county councils and public bodies who have made most <Col N="26" /> of the applications &ndash; they are being vetted by an outside group &ndash; are highly developmental.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined my views on the future of Aer Rianta in my reply to Question No. 34 of 17 October 2001, tabled by Deputy Stagg. I repeated that my main concern in relation to the corporate strategy to be decided upon for Aer Rianta is that it must be the correct strategy not just for the company itself and its employees but also for the users of the State airports.</P>
      <P>The sad events of 11 September have had a dramatic impact, as we know, on the global aviation industry and particularly on air travel to and from the USA. There is now a range of difficulties facing the aviation sector which are being urgently addressed by the Government and by Governments throughout the world. As the Deputy will appreciate, I am at present obliged to focus on these priorities, which include the critical issue of the survival of Aer Lingus, the levels of security at our airports and Exchequer support for Irish aviation companies in the field of war risk insurance. I will return at the appropriate time to considering, in consultation with my Government colleagues, the strategic options for the future of Aer Rianta in the long term.</P>
      <P>The three State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork are a vital part of the national transportation infrastructure and perform a vital function as major access points for business and tourism. They have seen a dramatic growth in passenger traffic in recent years, but that will not be the outcome of the last three months. Dublin Airport accounts for the bulk of traffic through State airports. The major extension of the terminal building at the airport is now in place and the integration of this with the older part is scheduled for completion in February, allowing for up to 20 million passengers annually as against the 14 million passengers using the facility last year. Shannon Airport has a new terminal building which was completed last year with the aim of doubling the annual capacity of the airport to 4.5 million passengers.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta has recently announced plans for an extensive capital investment programme at Cork Airport at a cost of £86 million, or 109 million, to provide major new infrastructure and facilities. I understand that the county council has now approved that proposal. I do not know if the appeal month has passed &ndash; I thought not &ndash; but providing there is no appeal to An Bord Pleanála, work will commence in early spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>Aer Rianta continues to plan for the ongoing provision of adequate infrastructure at our air<Col N="27" /> ports to cater for traffic, particularly in the second half of the decade. This type of advance planning and preparatory work is vital because of the long lead times involved with major projects and the need to plan sufficiently well in advance to have additional infrastructure available when required. Work will commence on that in early spring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. Does she agree that low cost access to the country is very important for the future of the tourism industry? Has she been approached by agencies, companies or others seeking the development of low cost terminals in airports, and what are her views on such approaches and ideas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is interest in a low cost terminal and the 11 September committee set up by the Government looked at that and other matters. I agree that low cost air access would have an effect on the number of tourists coming here. However, in tandem with that Aer Rianta has a commercial mandate which must be fulfilled. This relates to the 1998 Act which empowered Aer Rianta to operate within commercial parameters and clearly it must fulfil that mandate. My position remains the same. Whatever inducements can be provided by Aer Rianta for air passengers would be for all passengers and not for some. The same principle would apply to a low cost terminal. However, in the case of an airport with a capacity for 20 million people which is being used by 14 million, Aer Rianta would look twice at such a provision. Be that as it may, whatever is provided would have to be provided by law for all the airlines using the airport. One cannot differentiate. I would not allow a situation where State-provided land or buildings would be given to one airline. That would be the subject of a tribunal at some further date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned Cork. Is the £86 million in place? Is it coming from Aer Rianta's resources or does the State have an input into it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because Aer Rianta must be commercially viable. I drew down a eurobond at very favourable rates and there was a parliamentary question on it last year. The Deputy can get the details or I can get them for him. I understand that eurobond borrowing is what will enable the infrastructural work to take place in Cork. Dublin and Shannon have thankfully had their major capital infrastructure provided while Cork has not. I hope the planning process proceeds and if there is no hindrance to that it should commence in the spring. I asked my office to telephone the chairman about this and he said the £86 million infrastructure work in Cork will go ahead.</P>

Is she aware that the vast majority of carriages on the main lines are 35 to 40 years old and that they are uncomfortable, decrepit, run-down and the most substandard rolling stock in Europe?

      <P>The review group, comprising Mr. Bill Attley, Mr. John Dunne and Mr. Kevin Bonner, which reported to me on 4 July on Iarnród Éireann: The Way Forward indicated there are major questions to be addressed with regard to the future of the rail freight business.</P>
      <P>The review group set out a number of arguments in favour of, and against, retaining freight services generally. In this regard, it recommended that a special and thorough study of the issue be commissioned as a matter of urgency. In addition, the review group suggested that long range plans needed to be established for the rail sector as a whole.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the boards of Iarnród Éireann and CIE are considering a business plan for the rail freight sector for 2001-06 arising from commercial losses being incurred. They have forwarded a copy of the plan to me for my information and are in the process of discussing it with the trade unions. I understand no decisions have been taken.

      <P>Apart from the group the Minister mentioned which is in consultation with CIE and Iarnród Éireann, has the Government any intention of putting forward proposals to CIE to reopen the freight lines which were recently closed? Gypsum has used the Kingscourt line for 106 years to transport cement products to Drogheda. This freight is now being carried by road at enormous cost. Is the Minister aware that Iarnród Éireann spent a fortune in the past two and a half to three years repairing and upgrading this line, at enormous cost to the taxpayer, with people being employed at weekends? I hope the Minister will outline the Government's response to this matter because we should use these lines and keep freight off the roads in the interests of saving people's lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The details of the upgrading of the line in question were annotated in the IRMS safety review study which outlines necessary work on an annual basis at a cost of £100 million to £120 million per year. CIE carried out that work, which generated decent employment, in accordance with the findings of the IRMS study. I had a similar exchange with Deputy Jim Higgins on this matter earlier. It seems wrong that one would take freight from rail lines and put it on roads which are already crowded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann incurred losses of £6.4 million on freight services as a result of which it has prepared a draft business plan, the contents of which <Col N="32" /> have not yet been fully discussed or agreed. I agreed to a large extent with the comments of Deputy Higgins. It should be possible for Iarnród Éireann to consult individual businesses on this matter which would surely see the merit of transporting goods by rail rather than by road. I hope this approach will be adopted. Even though the Government has not taken a formal decision on this matter, its view is that it would be preferable to transport goods by rail rather than by road.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's assertion that it is preferable from an environmental point of view to transport goods by rail rather than by road. Does she accept, however, that it is actually cheaper to transport by road because environmental costs and the cost of damage to roads is not taken into account by the road users? Does she further accept that Government policy, in particular her own policy, informing Iarnród Éireann that it should be profitable has resulted in its having to close 46% of its freight service business? </P>

      <P>Since taking office, neither I nor the Government has issued such a direction to Iarnród Éireann. When I took office, the CIE subsidy was £103 million and the figure has now increased to £200 million. Obviously, it is desirable that a company would operate in a proper and business-like manner. The only plan I saw in this regard was a viability plan put forward by the former Minister with responsibility in this area, Deputy Lowry. The report, which comprised 24 pages, was discussed at length during a committee sitting.</P>
      <P>I hold the view that public transport should be properly funded and, to that end, the Government has poured huge reserves into public transport. One does not wish to pour £200 million into a black hole and hopes that the company would operate in a business-like manner. As I said earlier, the subsidy has almost doubled, not unlike that provided for health services. Iarnród Éireann provides a good service. Some £6.4 million was lost last year in the area of freight services&mdash;</P>

I did not issue any order to Iarnród Éireann to the effect that it should operate in a viable manner and I did not read Deputy Lowry's plan because I thought it was dotty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the Taoiseach is aware of the announcement by a scientific company in the United States that it has succeeded in cloning a human embryo. Emergency legislation is being passed by parliaments throughout the world to close the loophole. An amending Bill, for example, was passed by the House of Lords last night and is due to be debated in the House of Commons today. A statement of intent by the President of the United States has been issued which states that Congress will take similar action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach consider it ironic that at a time when these loopholes are being closed throughout the world, the Twenty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill is opening the loophole as wide as a gate by defining the commencement of pregnancy as from implantation rather than from conception? In view of this and to give the Government time to consider the emerging scien<Col N="44" /> tific situation, will the Taoiseach withdraw this Bill from Committee so the range of new issues which arise can be considered and so an extraordinary gap may not be introduced into the Constitution when every legislature in the world is seeking to close similar gaps?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach might not be aware that a statement was issued on Monday by my colleague, Deputy Upton, who is an expert on these matters. She drew attention to the fact that other legislatures are moving rapidly to put in place some form of legal framework as a holding operation until these issues can be dealt with in great detail. While there are wonderful scientific prospects ahead in terms of treating preventable genetically transmitted conditions and diseases, there is the dark side of such procedures which could lead to people being discriminated against for something that is not their fault.</P>
      <P>A response is required from the Government and I have no doubt the Taoiseach has been briefed to answer this question. This matter requires urgent attention and I can assure the Government that the Labour Party will co-operate fully in passing protective legislation until this matter can be properly examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw Deputy Upton's statement. It is a useful one. The issue of human cloning is not addressed in the Government's proposal on the protection of human life in pregnancy. That legislation deals specifically with the protection of unborn human life after implantation in a woman's womb. It is not concerned with assisted reproduction issues. The envisaged legislation deals with the prohibition of abortion and excludes from this prohibition medical procedures to safeguard the lives of pregnant women.</P>
      <P>In March last year the Minister for Health and Children established a commission on assisted human reproduction, composed of people whose expertise in this area is well accepted. Its terms of reference is to prepare a report on possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area. The commission is monitoring international developments in this area in the course of its work and will take account of the developments in relation to human cloning which took place in the United States last week. The publication of the commission's report will provide a basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of public policies. I do not have a date for a final or interim report but I will check it with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will agree that the ethical considerations which arise from the cloning of human embryos arise specifically from the fact that we are dealing with human life. That is why there are ethical problems among many people and in many jurisdictions. The Taoiseach <Col N="45" /> will also agree the human life in question, whatever way one might define it or whatever differentials one might make between cellular life and human life, is in fact a human life prior to implantation and might never be implanted. Consequently, there are repercussions for constitutional provisions being brought forward by the Government, with or without the consent of the House, when the protection provided in the provisions will commence only from implantation and will not deal with the protection of human life prior to that point. There are huge ethical issues stretching before us. They are even more dramatic when one considers that the professions involved in this research are scientists, not doctors. They are not, therefore, restricted in any way by the codes of practice to which doctors are subject.</P>
      <P>What instruction is the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste giving to the IDA with regard to its replies to companies who, aware that there is an open field in Ireland in terms of law in this area, are making inquiries about setting up stem cell research facilities in this jurisdiction? What advice is being given to the IDA to deal with these inquiries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat the two points I made. The issue of cloning does not come within the remit of the Bill that is currently before the committee. That Bill deals with the protection of unborn life after implantation in the woman's womb and does not deal with assisted reproduction. However, the latter has been an issue for the past few years and the Government discussed it at the beginning of last year. The Government asked the relevant experts to examine the issue, which is enormously complex. Deputy Noonan is correct that, as science moves on over the next number of years, some of the issues which Deputy Upton and the experts on the committee have raised will have social, ethical and legal implications. I will check this matter with the committee. It has been sitting for more than 18 months so it might be able, particularly because of the United States case, to produce an interim report.</P>
      <P>With regard to the IDA, I am not aware of any such cases being made.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that two of his Departments are engaged in a conflict in one local authority area where, effectively, guns are being put before houses as far as people in this city are concerned? He may recall that, on 16 and 17 May, I raised the issue of Clancy Barracks. It was offered for sale in June this year with a bidding price of approximately £45 million. Nobody successfully bought the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> Dublin Corporation bid for it. The corporation was advised that it was worth approximately £20 million, if that. The property comprises 13.6 acres which, depending on the level of density, could accommodate up to 350 separate dwellings. The housing list in Dublin Corporation stands at 7,600. Since October, when the Minister for Defence informed the House that the sale had not proceeded, my understanding from Dublin Corporation is that the Department of Defence, under instructions from the Department of Finance, has been told to hold out for the maximum amount of money it can get to fund the programme of guns, homes, bullets, tanks and whatever else the Department of Defence wants, while Dublin Corporation has been given clearance in principle from the Department of the Environment and Local Government to pay between £15 million and £20 million for the property. Neither Department can arrive at a resolution of this issue because the Department of Finance is insisting that the maximum amount of money be obtained to fund this programme. Can the Taoiseach intervene at this stage&mdash;</P>

      <P>Given that the proposals brought forward by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the past 18 months or so have effectively destroyed the house building industry, does the Taoiseach have any proposals to ensure that we avoid the projected 12,000 to 15,000 redundancies in the house building industry over the Christmas period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a debate previously about the issue of the Army site and I do not wish to go back over what happened prior to that date. The Minister for Defence has informed me that there are two bids still being considered by his Department. These bids are under the valuation price of the site. There are two other proposals and one of them has a significant content of social housing as part of it. These matters are being examined by the Department. It is not the case that the Minister's ability to negotiate with the developers is being thwarted.</P>
      <P>The CIF and the other bodies made their pre-budget submissions and met the Minister several weeks ago. Their proposals are in the public domain. If the Minister intends to respond to them he will do so in the budget.</P>

      <P>Can I take it then from the Taoiseach's reply that this is an accountancy exercise and that a Government that professes to have some concern for the homeless and which is in a position to do something positive by enabling a local authority to acquire a site for development <Col N="47" /> in order to meet its massive housing list, is thwarting the local authority because the Department of Defence has been instructed to hold out for the best possible deal? Can the Taoiseach in the run-up to Christmas and six months after this matter was first raised by me in this House, resolve the conflict between the two Departments and the Department of Finance and enable Dublin Corporation to get this property so that it can proceed to provide 350 dwellings against a background of a housing list of 7,500 people? Is the money more important to this Administration &ndash; the richest Administration this country has ever seen &ndash; than facilitating a local authority in getting scarce land resources to build 350 dwellings against the background of a housing list that has grown under this Administration? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is no conflict between the Departments on the issue. Dublin Corporation did not express an interest in this for 12 months. After the debate in the House, it put in a bid. The two bids being considered are below the valuation price. The Deputy will understand the difficulty that creates for the Minister and for the Department. There are two other proposals; one proposal has a considerable content of social housing. Any application which will be made for the site will have to have a 20% social and affordable housing provision. This will assist the corporation anyway. I understand that one of the applications is geared towards social and affordable housing. That is where the matter rests. It is not a question that the Department of Finance has stopped or blocked the Minister for Defence in negotiating with the people who tendered.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, the Taoiseach is aware that there are serious doubts now about the powers of committees of this House, especially if they are involved in any kind of activity which could be deemed to be an investigation. Will the Taoiseach state the Government's position on the work of the various committees, particularly the committee that was investigating the Abbeylara incident and also the committee which was inquiring into the signalling system in CIE? What course of action does the Government now intend to pursue? Will the Government take measures to advise the chairmen of committees, if possible through the good offices of the Attorney General, as to how their powers have been de-limited by the High Court judgment and how they should proceed between this and any appeal which may be resolved in the Supreme Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated last week the Attorney General has been examining this matter in recent days. I do not wish to speak about what <Col N="48" /> the committee may do. The Attorney General has been looking at more narrow grounds within the finding which he believes would create difficulties for committees and for the Houses of the Oireachtas in the future. We will come to a conclusion on those matters soon. He reported to Cabinet on these matters today. I was asked earlier on about a related matter in another area and I will raise that one with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Attorney General is likely to come to a conclusion soon.</P>

      <P>It was on the same matter, as I understand it, expert legal advice is suggesting that even the normal business of committees of the House may be impeded now as a result of this decision. Has the Taoiseach given consideration to the Attorney General and the State being joined in an appeal to the Supreme Court? There are a number of pressing imminent matters and I would remind the Taoiseach that once the Dáil falls in the context of a general election, work under way at committees goes down with it. In the case of one committee of the House, some eight months work has been put into preparing a report on a matter of some public interest. It is imperative in the short window between now and a general election, that whatever action is to be taken in the Four Courts be taken as speedily as possible and with the Attorney General ideally joined in that appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a preliminary examination of the report, Deputy Rabbitte is correct when he says that it could have wider implications. The Attorney General would take the same view but he is still finalising his opinion. On a preliminary assessment the Attorney General believes there is a narrower focus that he could take that would affect the workings of this House on any issue. He will finalise his views in the next day or two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most anxious to have this dispute resolved quickly and to the satisfaction of both sides.</P>
      <P>The production of sugar in all EU member states is regulated by the EU sugar regime. The EU regulation specifies a minimum price for sugar beet. In some member states, including Ireland, an additional payment, termed the deficit premium, is paid. Under the regulation, sugar manufacturers are obliged to pay at least the minimum and, where appropriate, the deficit premium for sugar beet. Any additional amount over and above the minimum price specified in the regulation is a commercial matter for negotiation between the two parties. Irish Sugar plc pays above the minimum price specified in the EU regulation.</P>
      <P>As the sugar manufacturing season is now well under way and many farmers are ready to deliver their crop, I am very concerned that this matter be resolved quickly and I urge both sides to do everything possible to find a solution. Over recent weeks, I have arranged and facilitated a number of meetings to try to find a solution acceptable to both sides. I am very disappointed at the lack of progress made.</P>
      <P>To progress matters and with the agreement of the two sides, the Tánaiste and I arranged for an independent mediator to chair a new round of meetings. Despite meetings over four days, from 21 to 24 November, no basis for agreement was found. I was most disappointed at this outcome.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that I am most anxious to see a resolution that is satisfactory to all concerned, including the 650 workers directly employed. In a further effort to facilitate a solution the Tánaiste and I will meet both sides tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm there was a proposed resolution by the independent mediator of a price increase of two euro per tonne together with an increase of one euro each year for the next three years? Will he confirm that the IFA seems to be happy with this solution and that Greencore is not? Why is he waiting until tomorrow to meet Greencore? Why did the Tánaiste and himself not meet it yesterday? I understand the Tánaiste was willing to meet Greencore yesterday. Will the Minister shed some light on that aspect?</P>
      <P>Why has the Minister waited so long to get involved personally in the dispute? The dispute has been going on for almost three weeks. Where has he been and why has it taken him so long to get involved personally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that Mr. Paddy Teahon, a person of significant standing in the community and a former Secretary General of the Taoiseach's Department, acted as a mediator for four days. In the end, it was not possible to find a resolution. He intimated that a solution might be based around two euro plus one euro <Col N="56" /> following on from that. I understand that was acceptable to the IFA but not to Greencore.</P>
      <P>On the dispute itself, as we operate a market economy, the arrangement in regard to the fixing of the price of beet takes place each year. The negotiations this year went on for ten months and eventually broke down. I would like to have seen both sides bring about a resolution much earlier. However, both sides ultimately got together. I facilitated a meeting which was chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Davern. He had four meetings with both sides and it was not possible to find a resolution. Subsequently, the Tánaiste and I arranged for the former Secretary General of the Taoiseach's Department, Paddy Teahon, to bring both sides together, which he did. The Tánaiste and I will meet both sides tomorrow.</P>
      <P>In regard to the fact that the dispute has caused the closure of the Carlow and Mallow plants in the past few weeks and my whereabouts, I am sure the Deputy keeps in touch with the media and various announcements from time to time. I do not think it is necessary to go into the detail on where I was but suffice to say that I was involved in very important and successful negotiations on behalf of the country, first, in the WTO talks and later in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that during the course of the dispute and since the negotiations commenced, there has been every willingness to be flexible on the part of the growers and their representatives in the IFA? Will he express his disappointment that there has been no flexibility or willingness to negotiate on the part of Greencore? Does the Minister agree, and will he make it clear to the House, that the future well-being of Greencore &ndash; we all know it is a plc &ndash; and its shareholders is dependent on an early resolution to this dispute? We should reflect on the fact that 80% of Greencore profits comes from sugar manufacturing. Will the Minister send a signal from this House to Greencore telling it that its future depends on its willingness to be flexible in negotiations to solve the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very glad to do that and I intend to do it tomorrow. There is unanimity in the House that an early resolution should be found to this problem. It is not in the interest of farmers because sugar beet loses sugar content and weight and is a danger on the side of roads. The frost which we are beginning to experience at night will speed up the deterioration of the beet. Many beet growers are involved in winter wheat production and would have utilised the good weather of recent weeks were it not for some beet still being in the ground. Greencore is a profitable business and has a sugar quota which it utilises. It is in the interests of both sides, the economy in general and the 4,000 sugar beet growers in particular, that this matter is resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know to what extent there is more flexibility on one side than the other. I know that a basis for resolution has not been found so far. I <Col N="57" /> understand that during the course of negotiations with the mediator, Paddy Teahon, the sugar company put last year's price plus 50p on the table. It went further and said that the price for the following year should be based on the EU sugar regime. That was unacceptable to the farmers. I hope that the Tánaiste and I will find an early resolution to this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the meeting of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Tánaiste with both sides mean that the mediator, Paddy Teahon, has been dispensed with? Is it to be a joint meeting with both sides or will the meetings be separate? If Paddy Teahon has been dispensed with, were minutess taken of the meetings he had and, if so, have those minutes been passed on to the Minister? As the Minister said in his reply, there are 650 jobs, but that can be increased significantly because a lot of the service industries are hit by this as well. The jobs of well over 1,000 workers are threatened in this regard. Where does this leave us after tomorrow? If it is not a joint meeting, what is the plan to bring both sides together? Is Paddy Teahon available to be used as a mediator by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>Paddy Teahon has done very valuable work and has brought the negotiations to the point where Greencore put a price on the table &ndash; that was not there until his mediation commenced. He is still available.</P>
      <P>We will have separate meetings with the farmers and the sugar company tomorrow. I hope and expect that will lead to a joint meeting. If it helps to have Mr. Teahon facilitate further discussion, he will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that any prolonged continuation of this dispute will not produce a marked reduction in the quantity of sugar produced? What will happen if there is no utilisation of the sugar quota this year? What effect will it have on the sugar company's right to use the quota next year? Will there be repercussions? In the event of the continuation of this dispute past the point where the harvest is recoverable, are there measures that the Government or the European Commission can take to make a different arrangement for the allocation of the sugar quota?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that we find a resolution quickly. Difficulties will be presented if finding a resolution takes time, for example, the quality of the sugar beet will deteriorate. I hope and expect that we will find a resolution so that the sugar company can utilise the quota. The gravity is such that 25,000 tonnes of sugar has been imported and I expect a lot more will be imported if a resolution is not found. We are not talking about 650 jobs but many more than that as the confectionery industry is also affected. It is a very grave <Col N="58" /> problem and we hope that a resolution can be brought about tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's earlier reference to us being in a market economy, the key issue here is the abuse of a dominant position by a private company which has given rise to hardship not only to farm producers and their families, but to many in the service industry and the 650 workers who are directly involved and are pawns in this. Does the Minister see a long-term future for Irish beet producers and processors, notwithstanding the power being exercised by the processors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>Each year the sugar company and the growers negotiate the price. That has gone on for a number of years but they have not resolved it so far this year. One of the ways to sort this out in the longer term is to appoint a regulator. The difficulty in doing that to sort out the immediate problem is that it will require primary legislation and that would take some time. Because of the gravity of this and the knock-on effects in other companies, it is a matter to which I am giving serious consideration. This is an important industry which must be kept in operation. It employs many people and has a 200,000 tonne quota. I will pursue the appointment of a regulator in the medium to long term but I want to resolve this matter immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are independent. Last year the Irish Sugar Company had a turnover of £147 million and made a profit of £26.5 million. It is a profitable business. I want to enter the talks as an honest broker and want to see an early resolution to this for the future well-being of the industry. I am, however, also looking at a way of preventing this from recurring every 12 months.</P>

        <b>: </b>I apologise for mistiming a vote that I thought was taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, on his efforts in the Minister's absence to bring the sides together. It was the one thing we asked him to do the last day we debated this here and he succeeded. This is a company that is making money, though it is carrying on as if it were put to the pin of its collar to give an increase. Without prejudging the talks, in fairness to the IFA delegation, it is willing to negotiate. It does not bode well that management is taking a very tough line when, after all, it gets the benefit <Col N="59" /> of our beet quota. It is important this long-established industry continues.</P>
    <P>Workers other than farmers are involved. When the Tánaiste gave an interview two weeks ago I rang her office about getting a mediator but I was told she had no responsibility. I find it strange that if an American computer company is closing down the Tánaiste comes in immediately to help with the dispute. Two weeks later it seems to be a responsibility, but that is two weeks too late as far as I am concerned. This should have been handled straight away.</P>
    <P>This is affecting business people in Carlow as well as the workers and there will be a long-term effect if it is not sorted out. Tomorrow the Minister should talk severely to Greencore. In my experience the people in that company are not the easiest people to talk to and the Minister may have to take an independent position. As far as a regulator is concerned, if primary legislation is needed the Minister would be guaranteed the support of everyone in the House to rectify the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concerns of Members. Obviously we want this dispute ended immediately and we want to put the future of Irish Sugar and Irish sugar beet on a sound basis. I will bring to the attention of those at the meeting tomorrow the concerns expressed here. I acknowledge what the Deputy said about the Minister of State, Deputy Davern. I was out of the country and he came in at a difficult time to bring the negotiations to a certain stage. Unfortunately, both sides could not agree on what needed to be agreed and further meetings with the mediator had to take place over four full days. Paddy Teahon is a very experienced mediator and negotiator and it was a great disappointment to me that the matter did not finish more positively.</P>

      <P>I know. I am telling the Minister that I do not want to see the beet growers of Ireland go the same way as the vegetable growers went 20 years ago. That is what will happen if Greencore does not play the ball with the farming organisations. It is clear the Minister should appoint a regulator. The time has come when Irish sugar growers should be protected. Surely they are entitled to an increase to cover the cost of inflation. The bully-boy tactics of one side in the negotiations in not coming to terms with the producers is not acceptable. I urge the Minister to do everything possible in his power to bring this to a speedy conclusion as the beet is losing its quality in the ground and farmers are at a huge loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree time is not on his side at this point? Does he further agree that the deterioration in the weather means it will become more difficult to get the crop out of the ground if we have heavy frost and wet weather? Will he tell us how long it will take for the factories which are now closed to get back into full production, assuming a resolution is found soon? People are worried about this. Will the Minister tell us what responsibility the company has regarding the utilisation of the national sugar quota? Is the Minister happy that all our sugar might have to be imported if this issue is not resolved soon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it is vital to get an early resolution because of the points made by the Deputy regarding the deterioration of the crop and so on. It takes three or four days to crank up the factories to get them going. Deputy Dukes asked about our sugar quota. EU regulations stipulate the quota for a member state is designated to the manufacturing enterprise in that State &ndash; Irish Sugar in our case. It is a matter then for the manufacturing enterprise to enter into contracts with growers, which Irish Sugar does in Ireland in relation to about 4,000 growers. We want to make sure this year's crop is harvested and that we put a long-term resolution in place, as 25,000 tonnes of sugar beet are already imported into Ireland. There is a trading agreement under &ldquo;Anything But Arms&rdquo; and in four or five years sugar will be more freely traded and there will be more competition here. The sugar company's side of the story is that it pays above the average price in the EU, particularly that in France and the UK, which are the main suppliers of sugar on the Irish market. On the other side, the growers point out that there is a handsome profit margin, to <Col N="61" /> which I referred a while ago. We not only want to find a resolution but to put the industry on a sound footing for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>Greencore has a turnover of £137 million and profits of £26 million. While the Minister will go in tomorrow as an independent broker, I strongly recommend, in view of those profits, that he go in as an independent on the producers' side. With Greencore making that much profit, it is a powerful body which can withstand this problem, despite saying it pays more than the EU average. Will the Minister ask Greencore tomorrow if it is seeking excessive profits to increase that £26 million further? It is not right or proper that Greencore should be allowed to increase its profits while farmers and producers are suffering. The Minister should make that point at tomorrow's meeting.</P>
      <P>Greencore has closed its plants in Thurles and Tuam and it is important the Minister seeks confirmation of its intention to keep the plants in Carlow and Mallow open. The Minister should also ascertain whether the company intends to close any of its distribution outlets or stores throughout the country. I have heard rumours to this effect which I hope are untrue.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the damage caused by frost to beet crops in the ground and on the roadside? The Minister should approach Greencore tomorrow with the same aggressive attitude the company has displayed towards farmers and producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this matter has been going on for the past ten months with Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and Paddy Teahon seeking to resolve it in the past few weeks, there is not a great deal between the two sides. The Deputy referred to profit margins. Greencore has put last year's price plus 50p on the table and the mediator has suggested up to two euros. Each euro would cost the company approximately £1 million off its bottom line which is not a great deal in view of the margin of profit already in the public arena. I hope it will be possible to narrow that gap and resolve this issue.</P>
      <P>Of course it is our wish that the plants referred to by the Deputy remain open. Deputies Sheehan and Jim O'Keeffe will recall the existence of fine vegetable plants in Skibbereen and Midleton but that industry has since disappeared. We do not want to see the sugar beet industry going the same way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the sugar company is playing Russian roulette in this matter? The dispute has been going on for ten months with the most recent phase occurring in the past three weeks. Farmers, sugar company workers, company shareholders and the economy are all losing as a consequence. The company alleges that the price it pays Irish growers is higher than that paid to growers in the UK and <Col N="62" /> France but does the Minister accept the price paid to growers in Germany, Denmark, Holland and elsewhere is higher than that paid here? The company is selective in its choice of statistics to support its case. Is the Minister prepared to stand behind the excellent work done by the mediator, Paddy Teahon, a man for whom I have the highest regard and respect and who assisted me in drawing up the Bantry package many years ago? The Minister stated that an additional 1 per tonne would cost only £1 million for a company which makes £26 million. Greencore continues to reject the mediator's recommendation while the IFA has sent out very positive signals about it. The mediator has made an honest effort and produced a fair compromise and the Minister should stand behind that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>This dispute also affects 39 farmers in County Kerry, primarily in the Ballyheigue, Fenit, Kilmoyley and Ardfert areas. These farmers make a substantial contribution to the local economy and will go out of business if this dispute is not resolved. What advice is the Minister offering to farmers to preserve harvested beet on the roadside? Has the Minister asked Teagasc to advise farmers on the best way to preserve the beet and retain its quality while they await the reopening of the factories?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>Teagasc personnel in Carlow have advised growers in this regard. From my experience delivering beet to Mallow factory when the train line in west Cork was closed &ndash; Ballinascarthy station being the preferred delivery point &ndash; the simple expedient of covering the beet during frosty periods prevented deterioration. High quality thrashed straw was used as a covering material in the olden days and Teagasc is advising farmers to do likewise now. The sugar content and weight of the beet has also deteriorated and winter wheat growers have been prevented from growing wheat crops in recent weeks, resulting in <Col N="63" /> loss of income and disturbance to normal farming activity. I hope we will be able to resolve this issue tomorrow.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the quota is allocated by the Commission to the sugar manufacturer. In the event of a substantial underperformance on quota or, indeed, if the quota is not performed on this year, can either the Minister or the Commission make a different arrangement about the allocation of the quota?

Am I correct in this interpretation and in noting that the Minister's major concern appeared to be one of delay, due to the fact that primary legislation is required? Does the Minister accept the principle of a regulator in the medium term? If so, on the matter of delay, I contrast the current situation with that of the early 1990s when legislation was required to facilitate a very good friend of the Minister and of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Larry Goodman. There was then no difficulty regarding delay in enacting primary legislation. The House was recalled during the summer recess and every official available in the Department and beyond was instructed to draft primary legislation which was passed by the House within days because of the urgency of the situation. Does the Minister not agree that once he accepts the principle of a regulator, delay will cause ongoing damage to all concerned?</P>

If I can be facilitated by the House this will be done very quickly. However, the budget will be presented next week and the problem could not be solved by legislation sooner than that.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary focus of the road traffic Acts is to establish a legislative basis for the safe use of the nation's road network. This focus is promoted in particular through the promulgation of laws relating to the behaviour of road users, the safety of vehicles and the use of traffic signs and other safety related infrastructure. To underpin and support those laws, the Acts provide for the application of a range of penalties and driving disqualification orders aimed at promoting compliance with the rules and regulations made to promote safety on our roads.</P>
      <P>This Bill marks a further development and enhancement of a code of law that was promulgated originally in 1961. The Road Traffic Act, 1961, remains the principal reference point for traffic law in this State. That Act replaced and enhanced a range of codes that had been in place since 1933 and saw the introduction of a series of initiatives such as consequential disqualification orders, the offences of dangerous and careless driving and the universal requirement for driving tests. Legislative initiatives since 1961 have supported the introduction of a comprehensive code relating to drink driving, a refinement of speed limit controls and the enhancement of the role of local authorities regarding the adoption of decisions relating to the control of traffic in their respective functional areas.</P>
      <P>The proposals contained in this Bill are aimed at a further enhancement of the legislative framework already established. As with other amending legislation within the road traffic code, the Bill ranges over a number of disparate areas. However, there is a central theme that permeates its main provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is driven by the need to improve road safety. Through its five year national strategy for road safety and policies and measures under this, the Government has given an unprecedented priority to road safety. This is now matched by <Col N="68" /> urgent media and public attention to road safety issues, with particular reference to the attainment of the 20% reduction targets in deaths and injuries within the lifetime of the strategy.</P>
    <P>This is the first Irish Government to have adopted a national road safety strategy. It is ambitious and hard edged and it has set demanding and quantified targets. In sponsoring its road safety strategy, the Government has, therefore, deliberately made itself more accountable than before for progress on road safety activities. Real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the strategy. Between 1997 and 2000, the level of road deaths has fallen by 12.1%. Over the same period, the number of serious injuries decreased by almost 25% relative to the reduction target of 20%. Early indications are that these positive trends have been maintained in 2001.</P>
    <P>Particular progress has been made in relation to traffic law enforcement. A testament to intensified Garda activity is the fact that in 2000, 224,000 on the spot fine notices for speeding have issued. In addition, 59,000 similar notices have issued in respect of the non-wearing of seat belts while there were 10,400 detections for drink driving. Therefore, the principal reference point for the promulgation of the Bill is the Government's road safety strategy. The strategy recommends that a number of legislative initiatives must be taken for the purpose of supporting its central themes. The primary focus of the Bill is, therefore, the promotion of road safety through the introduction of new deterrents and a review of the financial penalties applying to traffic offences generally.</P>
    <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to provide for a system of penalty points for minor traffic offences. The Bill also increases certain financial penalties for road traffic offences; provides for the introduction of a revised system of fixed charges to replace the current on the spot fine system; extends the use of cameras for the establishment of a constituent of a traffic offence; permits preliminary breath testing of drivers where they are involved in a road accident or a breach of road traffic law; provides a framework for implementing the EU sponsored European Convention on Driving Disqualifications, which permits the imposition by member states of driving disqualifications for offences committed in another State; authorises the procurement by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government of certain services under the Road Traffic Acts through the use of contractors; permits the control and management of traffic by local authorities for reasons of environmental protection; and assigns responsibility for the control of taxi stands and bus stops from the Garda Commissioner to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with individual provisions in the Bill, I propose to order my remarks on the basis of its general objectives. The major innovation of the Bill and its principal purpose is to provide for the introduction of a penalty points system. This <Col N="69" /> initiative reflects a commitment given in the Government's road safety strategy. As indicated in the strategy, the design of this system required careful consideration in Irish circumstances especially in the context of the exclusive constitutional role of the courts in the administration of justice. This gave rise to protracted examination of the legal issues in consultation with the Attorney General. The House will appreciate that to proceed otherwise could have given rise to uncertainty.</P>
    <P>Penalty points systems operate in a number of countries, including four other member states of the European Union. Such systems have by no means been adopted by all or even a large number of developed countries. For example penalty points systems are not operated in some EU member states that boast the most advanced road safety records. However, in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, the introduction of penalty points systems has been regarded as having contributed significantly to the improvement of driver behaviour with a consequent reduction in road casualties.</P>
    <P>In introducing penalty points, we are seeking to promote the same focus that has been successful in other countries. The aim of the system is to improve driver behaviour by instilling greater caution and responsibility in motorists. It is also hoped that the system will see a transfer of most of the enforcement of traffic offences from the courts to an administrative process. To further support that latter aim, the Bill proposes a radical review of the maximum financial penalties associated with traffic offences, the introduction of a new system of fixed charges and the extension of the circumstances where cameras and other equipment can be used in the detection of traffic offences.</P>
    <P>While the level of on the spot fines was last reviewed in 1994, the main financial penalties provided for in the Road Traffic Acts have remained unchanged since 1984. Through this Bill, the opportunity is being taken to adopt across the board increases to the maximum penalties applying to traffic offences. The general penalty which applies to the majority of minor offences under the Road Traffic Acts has been raised from its current value of £150 to 800, that is the equivalent of £631. The many specifically designed maximum penalties in traffic legislation are also being considerably increased.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces the first major review of the administrative penalty system provided for under the road traffic Acts since 1961. The new system of fixed charges involves a redesign and refinement of the current on the spot fine system. The new system will underpin the penalty points system and will bring greater certainties to the operation of administrative penalties. It will feature the introduction of a two-tiered payment that will see the level of the charge increased by 50% where payment of the original amount is not made within 28 days of the issue of the original notice. The range of offences to which the penalty <Col N="70" /> points system will apply creates the impetus for a major extension to the scope of the offences to which fixed charges will apply. In addition, the significant increases in the maximum fines for offences being promoted through this Bill will allow for the introduction of significant increases in the levels of fixed charges when compared to the current on the spot fines. Regulations to give effect to those changes will be pursued quickly following the passing of the Bill. The environment under which traffic law is enforced will be further enhanced through the adoption of the European Convention on Driving Disqualifications which is being facilitated through this Bill.</P>
    <P>The laws on drink driving were comprehensively reviewed and updated through the Road Traffic Act, 1994. However, a commitment was given in the road safety strategy that there would be a review of the current legal requirement for a member of the Garda Síochána to form the opinion that a person has consumed alcohol before a breathalyser has been used. The Bill provides for a significant extension to the powers available to the Garda.</P>
    <P>In addition to those matters that can be regarded as falling within the overall area of the enhancement of the enforcement of traffic law, this Bill also addresses a number of additional issues. It provides for a streamlining of the basis for agreements between the Minister and other parties to carry out certain functions under the Road Traffic Acts. In addition, the Bill introduces for the first time a provision through which restrictions may be imposed on traffic for the exclusive purpose of the protection of the environment and further streamlines responsibility for the application of controls relating to traffic and public service vehicles.</P>
    <P>I will refer in some detail to the main initiatives proposed in the Bill. Sections 2 to 7 and the First Schedule provide for the introduction of penalty points. This system is being promoted both in the context of road safety and as a contribution to the overall enforcement of traffic laws. The Road Traffic Acts already identify a number of very serious offences in respect of which a conviction leads automatically to the imposition of a consequential disqualification. In many instances the disqualification only applies on conviction for a second or subsequent offence. Great care has been exercised in ensuring the penalty points system will extend to those offences that have a direct impact on road safety other than those that attract consequential disqualification orders.</P>
    <P>The system as proposed provides that in the case of the majority of offences, there will always be a distinct choice presented to a person who receives a notice of the commission of a penalty point offence. The person can either pay the fixed charge and incur a low level of points or he or she may decide to allow the matter to proceed to court. Where a court convicts a person, the level of penalty points is increased significantly. Unlike systems in other states, that proposed in the Bill is exemplified by a significant degree of certainty. <Col N="71" /> In every case, the person on whom a notice is served will be fully aware of the number of penalty points that will apply where a fixed charge is paid or where a conviction is given by a court. In the case of certain offences, the option of the payment of a fixed charge is not being made available. These represent the most serious of the offences which are included in the First Schedule, including careless driving, using a vehicle without insurance and driving a dangerously defective vehicle.</P>
    <P>Penalty points will be recorded for three years and where a total of 12 is reached the person will be automatically disqualified from driving for six months. This is the first occasion where a disqualification will be applied without the direct intervention of a court. This reflects the fact that a person will reach that threshold only where he or she is involved in a number of separate incidents involving offences that attract penalty points. In addition, penalty points will be recorded in many incidents where a person decides to pay a fixed charge to avoid the matter proceeding to court. The current arrangements through which a disqualification following a conviction for the commission of a single serious offence is imposed by a court will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>The operation of penalty points will be supported by necessary organisational and IT infrastructure. Preparations for these developments are under way. The software application of a national driver file, NDF, was completed in late 2000 and is being rolled out and tested. Consultants have been engaged and are progressing the addition of penalty point functionality to the NDF. That enhanced licensing record will be supported by IT developments being pursued by both the Courts Service and the Garda to provide for the notification to that record of incidences leading to the recording of penalty points. In addition, the penalty points system will be further supported by the commencement of section 25 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, which requires all drivers to carry their driving licences.</P>
    <P>In association with the introduction of penalty points and to further support the operation of driving disqualifications generally, section 21 provides that in certain circumstances a person who is accused of an offence and the offence is to be tried in court may be required to present his or her licence to the Courts Service for recording purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 9 facilitates the entry into force of a framework for bilateral co-operation with other EU member states in applying driving disqualifications for a number of serious road traffic offences committed in another member state. This is based on and gives effect to the European Convention on Driving Disqualification that was adopted at EU level and signed by Ireland in 1998. The focus of the convention is to ensure that a person who commits a serious traffic offence in one country cannot escape the full <Col N="72" /> effects of a disqualification imposed by that country by the simple expedient of going to another state. This also creates the certainty that where disqualifications are imposed, all recipients suffer the full consequences and effects of the disqualification irrespective of whether they are citizens of that state.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces a new administrative system in respect of disqualifications generally. With the advent of penalty points, the concept of the courts applying endorsements to licences is not being continued. It has been determined that the approach to the recording of penalty points, which is based on the details being recorded in the national driver file, will be put in place in respect of all disqualifications. This is facilitated by amendments to section 37 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, that are being introduced through section 8. In addition to improving the overall administration of disqualification orders generally, this new approach reflects the fact that new developments in the design of driving licences being considered by the European Union will mean that the current arrangements through which disqualifications are endorsed on licences cannot be continued in the medium to long term.</P>
    <P>Section 10 extends the grounds on which a member of the Garda Síochána may require a driver to provide a preliminary breath specimen. The section provides that where a driver is involved in a road accident or where a garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed, he or she may require that the driver provide the specimen. This is in addition to the current grounds where the garda has formed an opinion that a driver has consumed alcohol. There is international research available which indicates that alcohol is a factor in up to 40% of road accidents. Estimates in Ireland suggest that alcohol is a factor in 33% of fatal accidents. There is, therefore, a clear case for directing this proposed enhancement of the enforcement of drink driving legislation at drivers involved in accidents. A similar argument can be made in relation to incidents where motorists breach traffic laws. I consider that breath testing on the more selective basis provided for in the Bill represents a significant improvement on current arrangements but maintains an efficient use of resources and brings us into line with practice in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to listen to arguments for the introduction of full random breath testing. Significant improvement in driver behaviour could arise from the knowledge that any driver may be stopped at any time for the purposes of a breath test. However, the introduction of random breath testing raises a number of important issues, in particular in relation to enforcement. I look forward to the debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 provide for the replacement of the current on the spot fine system with the new system of fixed charges. The new system will offer a greater degree of certainty to the enforcement agencies and will offer the accused person <Col N="73" /> a clear and unambiguous choice. The ramifications of each of the alternatives available to him or her will be clearly identified. This will be of particular importance in the context of penalty point offences. In association with the development of the fixed charge system a number of significant amendments are proposed in these sections that will further enhance enforcement. In the first instance, greater clarity is being introduced in the operation of the new system by comparison to its predecessor where a detection of an alleged offence does not involve the direct intervention of a member of the Garda or a traffic warden. In addition, the sections place a greater level of responsibility on the registered owners of vehicles in relation to their use. The sections specifically provide that in the absence of the naming of another driver, responsibility for the alleged commission of an offence will lie with the registered owner.</P>
    <P>Section 13 introduces, for the first time, a legislative basis for the adoption of controls on traffic and vehicles for the express purpose of the protection of the environment. Regulations under the section may be made in respect of issues such as controls on the construction, equipment and use of vehicles, the carrying of specified goods or materials, the prohibition of vehicles from entering certain places and the maximum speed limits applying to vehicles. Regulations may also apply restrictions on the use of specified fuels in vehicles.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill provides for the streamlining of the statutory basis for agreements between the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and other persons for the more efficient performance by these people of functions under the Road Traffic Acts, other than functions involving the making or approval of statutory instruments. The section allows the Minister to enter into an agreement with a person or company for that person to provide specific services under the Acts. Agreements may provide for fees or payments to be made and for the disposal of those moneys. Examples of agreements of this nature already entered into are those relating to the national car test and the theory test.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic Act, 1994, introduced significant changes to the law as it applies to the general control of traffic and parking on our roads. In particular, that Act provided for a much greater empowerment of local authorities in relation to the determination of key traffic controls. Local authority members were given specific powers to determine the locations in their areas where speed limits are to be applied. Sections 15 and 16 introduce further changes to traffic law that are being promoted in the same overall theme that underpinned the developments in 1994. The sections provide specifically for the amendment of the aspects of the legislative provisions that related to the operation of buses and taxis. In line with a commitment given in the report of the Dublin Taxi Forum, section 15 provides for the transfer to local authorities from the Garda Com<Col N="74" /> missioner of the power to make by-laws for appointed stands for taxis. Section 16 also gives powers to local authorities to determine the locations at which bus stops can be provided. This power is also being transferred from the commissioner.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for an extension of the range of matters in respect of which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may make regulations under section 35 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994. The amendment provides that the Minister may make rules relating to the control of the stopping and parking of vehicles at bus stops. These initiatives effectively complete the transfer from the Garda Commissioner of powers relating to the making of traffic laws that have been in place since the passing of the Road Traffic Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>In this quick outline of the provisions of the Bill, I will finally return to the general subject of road safety and traffic law enforcement. Section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, provides that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may make regulations in relation to the control of driving instruction. That section is being significantly amplified through amendments being introduced in section 18 of the Bill. These amendments will, in particular, empower the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to approve bodies for the purpose of the quality control of driving instructors. In addition, the new provisions will allow for an exemption for driver instructors from the direct licensing requirements in the section where they are granted certificates from an approved body.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 20 is to introduce a new and significantly augmented legislative basis for the use of cameras and other equipment for the purpose of the enforcement of traffic laws. At present, under section 105 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, such equipment may only be used in the context of establishing the speed of vehicles. The new section provides that the equipment may be used to establish any constituent of an offence. This significant extension in the use of equipment will provide significant support for the enforcement of traffic laws generally and for the enhancement of the deterrent value of the new penalty points system.</P>
    <P>This Bill will provide significant legislative support to the efforts being made by the Government and associated public and private agencies to improve road safety significantly. The introduction of penalty points, the increase in financial penalties and the introduction of the fixed charge system are all directly focused on supporting the increasing efforts of the Garda in enforcing traffic laws. It must be remembered that no one measure constitutes the key to the strategy. It is widely accepted that road safety strategies must consist of many different policies and measures and that all have their contribution to make. A penalty points system will be an important and worthwhile measure in support of the strategy but it will not of itself guarantee its success. However, <Col N="75" /> taken as a whole, it is hoped that all the initiatives contained in this Bill will encourage a more precautionary approach by road users generally so that Ireland will find itself positioned among the most advanced states in Europe. I look forward to a positive and constructive debate on the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome, unreservedly, publication of this long awaited Bill. Anything that contributes to greater road safety is to be greatly welcomed, particularly in the context of an apparently increasing number of multi-fatality road accidents and single car accidents involving young drivers. This Bill was intended to form an important cornerstone of the road safety strategy, 1998 to 2002. There has been a huge and unforgivable delay in the introduction of the penalty points system which was first announced in 1998 when the road safety strategy was launched, with a promise of legislation in the following year. That target was missed, new targets were set and missed, a further target was set and that was also missed, and we are now finally discussing this Bill on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>However, although enabling legislation can be enacted in a relatively short time, the actual implementation of the penalty points system is still at least 12 months away and, I suspect, probably even longer. I criticise the failure of the Government to provide the technology to allow the computer systems to talk to one another and even to set up the computer systems, the national driver file, the Garda computer system and the Courts Service system. Even at this point, in November 2001, none of these systems is ready to go into operation much less ready to speak to one another. It is difficult to justify this delay and it is impossible to justify it to those families who have been touched by road deaths or serious injury in the past four years. If there was any real sense of urgency about reducing road deaths, with all the resources and expertise available to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the computer systems necessary to implement the penalty points system should have been progressed much faster than they have been. They should certainly have been operational before the end of the road safety strategy period. After all, it was to be the cornerstone of that strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State is aware, that is not the only aspect of the strategy that has run late. The written theory test only came into operation this year although it was originally scheduled for 1999. The national survey on the wearing of seat belts and the national speed limit survey also ran <Col N="76" /> late. One thing which did not run late was the introduction in 1994 of the legislation requiring drivers to carry a driving licence, but the regulations to implement it have not been signed. That is absolutely critical to this Bill. The driving licence issue, the security of the system, the design of the licence and the effort to prevent the holding of multiple licences, for which there will now be a huge incentive, are absolutely critical and, indeed, provide another argument for a single identity card system for everybody. What happened to the promise of a unique identifier for every licence holder? The courts will be clogged if that system is not absolutely foolproof.</P>
    <P>However late it is and however unprepared for it we are, I welcome the provision for the imposition of fixed fines attracting penalty points which will eventually reach a level resulting in the loss of a driver's licence. Penalty points alone are not a total panacea for all our driving ills but they have significant advantages over the current regime. They are certainly fairer but, primarily and critically, they will be a deterrent for everybody. There is anecdotal evidence that wealthier drivers and some professional drivers who drive for a living and use cars owned by the company which are not registered in their names are happy to accumulate fines. Indeed, I have even heard them on occasion boast of the number of fines they have accumulated, as if they were a badge of honour. From now on they will not be able to do that with impunity, laugh about the matter and pay the fines at no inconvenience to themselves.</P>
    <P>The threat of losing one's driving licence can change the behaviour of drivers. There is a deterrent component in the incremental penalty points system. However, if it is to act as a deterrent, critical factors in its success are detection and enforcement. There is little in the Bill that would cause one to believe that the level of detection will be strengthened. The Bill permits the use of speed cameras, which is welcome, but that will generate problems which I will discuss later. Detection will still fall primarily to the members of the Garda Síochána in the absence of traffic corps or road police but there simply are not enough gardaí to have the type of impact on driver behaviour that is required.</P>
    <P>The gardaí will continue to be the first line of defence in ensuring that detection takes place and that the necessary follow-up in the serving of notices is expedited. Given that the budget allocation for the Garda contains a mere 4% increase, it is difficult to see how this effective decrease, which might result in the loss of manpower, is consistent with adding to the members' workload. This comes at a time when there are many other demands on Garda time in terms of the growing complexity and sophistication of crime. Greater demands are also made of gardaí in terms of traffic management, particularly in urban areas, dealing with roadworks and so forth.</P>
    <P>I have major concerns about how the system proposed in the Bill will work. There is no appeal <Col N="77" /> system. This is a major failing because it will have a huge impact on the implementation of the Bill. The aim of the legislation is to simplify the system by introducing fixed fines which would automatically attract penalty points. However, the only appeal against penalty points is to refuse to pay the fine and instead opt to go before the courts. This is not an appeal system because it is not voluntary. Once a person does not pay, he or she is automatically prosecuted.</P>
    <P>A number of aspects of the legislation cause concern, mainly because so many of them will end up in the courts. The Minister should consult the Comptroller and Auditor General's report of 1998 which found that more than one third of on-the-spot motoring fines in that year went unpaid and 67% of summonses were not heard by the courts. The report went on to comment that the planned changes in the on-the-spot fines system, including the more widespread use of speed detection cameras and the introduction of a driver penalty points system, would put increasing pressure on Garda systems and that unless the way in which these changes were implemented was properly planned and managed, the system was likely to become increasingly inefficient.</P>
    <P>Even if the gardaí successfully detect the offence and serve the notice in the proper way, the only form of appeal is to go to court. This will put huge strain on the courts. Given the implications of paying the fine and being given penalty points for losing one's driving licence, the incentive to go to court is much greater. The budget allocation for the Courts Service is reduced in money terms as well as real terms for the coming year. This does not inspire confidence that the courts system will be able to cope with an increase in demand. The critical problem arises from the fact that so many cases &ndash; 67% &ndash; do not end up in the courts. This will act as an incentive not to pay the fine to those who are seeking to avoid penalty points. The incentive is that one will either be successful in court or that the case will not reach the court. It is critical that the courts are resourced to deal efficiently with every case referred to them.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the use of speed cameras for the purpose of detecting fixed fine offences. Again, many cases under this section will end up in the courts. I have huge concern about this provision. Where a member of the Garda Síochána is not present to identify the driver, the fine and subsequent penalty points will be imposed on the registered owner. This turns on its head the concept of a person being innocent until proven guilty. There are various problems with this approach, even though I understand why the approach is being taken.</P>
    <P>First, the provision might result in targeting the wrong person who subsequently loses his or her licence as a result of an offence committed by others. Second, unless the registered owner can not alone prove that he or she was not the driver of the car but also who was the driver, his or her only recourse is to go to court. I could not tell the <Col N="78" /> House who was driving my car last week, much less last month. This provision may result not only in gross miscarriage of justice but in forcing innocent people to go through the expense, inconvenience and distress caused by court cases.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the practical difficulties facing the Minister in establishing the guilty party when an offence is detected by a camera. I could even argue that there is merit in making the owner of the vehicle responsible for other drivers. However, it is a step too far to provide that a person may be assumed to be guilty and be subject to prosecution and the possible loss of his or her driving licence on the basis of nothing more than his or her car being spotted by a camera without at least putting an intermediate appeals system in place. That runs contrary to the principles which underpin our system of justice. Whatever about being forced to prove one's innocence, to have to prove the guilt of others seems to run contrary to the principles which underpin our law. It is a function of the Garda Síochána in every other area of the law. This is a fundamental flaw in the legislation and it will ultimately be challenged and possibly overturned.</P>

      <P>The Chair wishes to mention that even though the subject matter of the motion of censure, of its nature, relates to the alleged conduct of a Member, the standard rules for debate apply and Members should <Col N="80" /> refrain from making derogatory remarks. There is a long-standing tradition that Members should not criticise or make charges against a person outside the House as he or she is defenceless against accusations made under privilege, and I ask for co-operation in that regard. I am sure all Members will agree that it is in the interest of the standing and dignity of this House that these rules are adhered to by Members.</P>
      <P>On a separate point, on the Order of Business today I indicated I would bring the House up to date on a complaint that has been received from a person outside the House in respect of Standing Order 58. Members will appreciate that, under Standing Order 58, it is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle at this stage as to how the matter will be dealt with. His office has had a number of exchanges of communication with the person concerned and these are ongoing. The Ceann Comhairle hopes to deal with this matter in accordance with the procedure laid out in the Standing Order as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I thank my colleagues in the Labour Party for facilitating us in this matter.</P>
      <P>I have many problems with Deputy Gildea's behaviour but I will confine my remarks to two aspects. The first point I wish to make relates to privilege. There is absolute privilege for all of us in relation to remarks made in this House. That privilege goes to the heart of our democratic system and indeed is a feature of genuine democracies all over the world, but with it is an obligation to be absolutely accurate and honest in everything we say. Privilege is one side of the coin, the obligation to be absolutely accurate and honest is the other side. We cannot have one without the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We move this motion of censure because the traditions of the House require that when a slur <Col N="81" /> of this nature is made, a technical apology is not enough. What is required of Deputy Gildea is that he specifically accepts and states that Deputy Owen, as Minister for Justice or otherwise, never received payment from CMI and never got involved in operationally directing the activities of the Garda Síochána in Donegal or elsewhere, and that he never had any basis for the outrageous, unfounded allegations he made about her in this House last week.</P>
    <P>I particularly regret the failure of the Government to support this motion of censure. I also regret its failure to persuade Deputy Gildea to make the appropriate personal statement. For four and a half years, the Government has been able to get the Deputy to do its will. No doubt his support has cost it or, to put it more accurately, it has been at some cost to the taxpayer. By failing to persuade him on this occasion, the Government is implicitly supporting Deputy Gildea in his blatant breach of one of the fundamental codes of behaviour of this House. I regret this failure and regret that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats should be complicit in Deputy Gildea's slur on the holder of one of the most sensitive Ministries in our system.</P>
    <P>There is another dimension that relates to parties outside the House. A letter has been sent to the Ceann Comhairle, a copy of which was circulated to me, and I wish to quote from that letter. The gentleman writing the letter is Mr. Raymond P. Doyle. I do not intend to quote the letter in full but I will quote some relevant parts of it.</P>
    <P>I write to you as my only means of redress for a grave wrong and injury perpetrated on me by a member of the Oireachtas who, in so doing, shamelessly and with total disregard for the unfair limitations imposed on ordinary members of the public to protect themselves against such unfair attacks, abused the privilege of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I refer to the unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations made in the Dail on Wednesday last by Tom Gildea, T.D., against Cable Management Ireland Ltd. and, by direct implication, myself as Chief Executive of the company up to the time of its acquisition two years ago. I can offer you absolute assurances that neither I nor the company nor anyone representing the company offered, or paid, any inducement to Deputy Nora Owen at any stage. Neither was any such inducement offered or paid to any other politician and it is shocking and reckless in the extreme for such allegations to be made by Deputy Gildea, especially in circumstances where I do not enjoy the rights conferred by privilege of the Oireachtas on him.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for politicians to consider how such abuse of the rules of procedure and privilege devalues politics in general among an increasingly sceptical public but you will understand that my over-riding concern is that my good name and reputation should be irreparably damaged in a manner that allows me no form of fair or proper redress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> The fact that Deputy Gildea has offered his apology to Mrs. Owen and her Party for any hurt caused is of little comfort to me and to the many fine people who held positions of responsibility in the Board and management of Cable Management Ireland Ltd.</P>
    <P>This is a scandalous and entirely unacceptable situation and I feel strongly that it makes the case for removal of this privilege so that members of the public, such as myself, can take appropriate action through legal procedures open to one and all at every level.</P>
    <P>Mr. Doyle goes on to make a series of allegations about issues in Donegal related to the MMDS system and the participation of Deputy Gildea and his supporters in such activities. He goes on to say then that he, in a public place, recently has been made the subject of remarks which held him up to ridicule and which damaged his good name. I take the point made by Mr. Doyle.</P>
    <P>There is a major issue also for persons outside the House who are abused under privilege. We are seeking to redress the damage done to our colleague, Deputy Owen, by taking this extreme move of moving a motion of censure on Deputy Gildea. There are also issues for persons outside the House which we cannot remediate here but, in the first instance, the Ceann Comhairle and, in the second instance, the Government of the day have an obligation to vindicate the good name of persons outside the House.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a second point in relation to Deputy Gildea's contribution last week. One of the principal results of Deputy Gildea's unwise intervention was to move the focus away from the McBrearty case and I cannot help asking if that was the intention of Deputy Gildea's statement last week. The Deputy's activities are, of course, a matter for himself and his constituents but his contribution to the debate last week was extraordinary. He is not a Deputy who contributes at length to debates in this House and the fact that he intervened last week in such a forceful way was particularly unusual. Anybody reading the reports of what happened in this House last week could come to the conclusion that we had not discussed what is potentially one of the most serious set of allegations ever made against the Garda Síochána anywhere in this country.</P>
    <P>When the Government gets the support of four Deputies in this House it has an obligation to the behaviour of those Deputies. They should take Deputy Gildea aside again and ensure that he makes an appropriate statement in the course of this debate tonight.</P>
    <P>The principal issue from which the focus was removed last week is an issue which we regard with serious concern on this side of the House. Our concern was reinforced by the affidavits sworn by the McBrearty family and heard in the High Court on Friday last. Nothing whatsoever has been done since to allay the concerns that were expressed so eloquently by all the Deputies on the Opposition benches who spoke last week. We regard this as an extraordinarily serious issue. <Col N="83" /> It has been overshadowed by the internal difficulties that have been caused by Deputy Gildea's allegations. The man who sat on his hands last week, the present incumbent of that high office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has an obligation to deal with the McBrearty affair. Allegations against the Garda Síochána, or against any police force in any democracy in the world, which are not cleared up at the first available opportunity are like rust or acid &ndash; they eat away public trust in the Garda Síochána. Once one's trust in a police force goes, the public no longer have full confidence in it and we have a crisis on our hands.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for reasons he has not explained to the House, was extraordinarily tardy. He knew, or should have known, that a request for an exhumation order had been lodged in his Department as far back as September 1997. He must have known that this request was subsequently withdrawn at the request of the Garda Síochána. He must tell us why he did not ask the reason this was done or, if he did ask, the reply he got. He must have known that a file was sent from the Garda Síochána to the Director of Public Prosecutions and that its recommendation on that file was that the fact of murder could not be established and consequently that there was no case. He must have known this fact as far back as late 1997, four years ago. He must have known that the Director of Public Prosecutions, having examined the file, reaffirmed that there was no case, sometime in the course of 1998, three years ago. Why did this continue for so long until the eventual exhumation took place and the State pathologist said the injuries were consistent with a hit-and-run accident, not with the allegations made in statements, which now appear to be totally fraudulent, that the unfortunate individual was beaten to death?</P>
    <P>These are serious allegations for the Minister to consider. This debate was totally blown out of the consciousness of the House and that of members of the public last week by Deputy Gildea's intervention. I do not want to spend three hours, tonight and tomorrow night, dealing with him. It is the intention of my party to get back to the substantive issue and ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform what he intends to do about the behaviour of certain gardaí in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I am not doing this out of a lack of support for the Garda. I am proud of the force. As Minister for Justice, I saw what it had to endure in certain circumstances. We have a great Garda force, but unless public confidence is re-established and all these allegations are dealt with, we will have a serious problem.</P>

        <b>: </b>It is now one week since we debated the McBrearty affair and everyone will have read the newspaper reports and editorials and heard the radio and television com<Col N="84" /> ments, all of which were critical of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue's performance and his failure to act or even appreciate the gravity of the debacle over which he is presiding. It has been a bad week for him and there are worse weeks to come.</P>
      <P>This is not just about the unfortunate death of Mr. Barron, although that is very important. Five years and one month after he was left to die on a lonely Raphoe roadside the person who drove the car that killed him is still at large. The Minister and the Garda have failed to establish who killed him. They have also failed to establish who, at Garda level, made the decision to change a road traffic accident to a hit-and-run case and then into a murder investigation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has failed to establish the reason the McBrearty family were singled out as the murder suspects and left destroyed, emotionally and commercially. He stood idly by as the vital exhumation order was rescinded four years and one month ago. He stood idly by and failed to ascertain who made the decision to cancel the order. He stood idly by while a very good ban garda, whose honesty helped to shine a light on the forged signature of Mr. Frank McBrearty junior, was intimidated and harassed out of the job she loved and left a broken person. He stood idly by as Garda inquiry after Garda inquiry went through the motions, but yielded nothing other than charging one garda for the illegal possession of a firearm and five other civilians, many of whom have criminal records, with other offences. He stood idly by in regard to the establishment of who planted the explosive device at the MMDS at Ardara. He stood idly by as the Diver family were subjected to exactly the same nightmare as the McBrearty family. He stood idly by and failed to establish who was responsible for the decision to divide up the explosives find and plant them across the Border giving the false impression to the RUC that Garda surveillance work had uncovered subversive paramilitary plots.</P>
      <P>In spite of repeated pleas from Deputy Howlin and me in the past two years, the Minister has again failed to establish a sworn public inquiry to end this charade once and for all. He stood idly by for four years and four months&mdash;</P>

        <b>Mr. Higgins</b>
        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>Deputy Rabbitte kindly agreed to give me some of his time. The Minister stood idly by for four years and four months and allowed the reputation of the Garda force to be sullied by his inaction and ineptitude. He stood idly by as public confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system was badly damaged and allowed to ebb away over what the public sees as nothing other than a cover-up by him. He has clung to excuses pleading constraints imposed by civil actions, but they are no longer a problem as the McBrearty legal team has removed this fig leaf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> The Minister has hidden behind the guise that criminal prosecutions were an impediment, but none of the gardaí named in the High Court last week has been prosecuted to date. He has bought time by promising an independent inquiry if the Garda inquiries are unsatisfactory and fail to establish the facts. They have failed to establish the truth and still the Minister prevaricates. He has presided over Garda inquiry after Garda inquiry, all of which have been conducted behind closed doors where evidence was not taken under oath and none of which we have seen, let alone come into the public domain.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister sat here and stared mutely ahead as Deputy Gildea vilified the reputation of one of the most honourable Members of the House, Deputy Owen. He sat silent and consenting as Deputy Gildea trotted out a tissue of falsehoods. Any self-respecting Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with a comprehension of the word &ldquo;justice,&rdquo; would have intervened and put an end to the character assassination of one of the most honest and effective Ministers for Justice this country has ever seen.</P>
    <P>Not alone has there been no action, there has not even been a pretence of action. As if to add salt to the wounds of the McBrearty and Diver families, gardaí who were closely involved, some of whom were named in the High Court proceedings on the issue of the circular letter blackening the McBrearty name, have actually been promoted by the Minister in the meantime. The McBrearty and Diver families were put in the dock by the failure of the Minister to discharge his responsibility. If he was present tonight, I would say to him that he is well and truly in the public dock now. There is huge public disquiet at what he has allowed to happen and his failure to deal with this issue as well as his repeated objection to the Opposition's request for a sworn inquiry, the only credible course of action.</P>
    <P>The Minister can announce all the new prison spaces that he wants and trot out his record on Garda recruitment. He can parade the crime figures and statistics, but he will be remembered as having failed to deal with a crime which lay on his doorstep. Terrible wrongs were perpetrated against innocent people. Gardaí grossly abused their position while public confidence in the police and the system of justice which he was supposed to protect were undermined. He failed the system and the public. He can whistle all he wants past the graveyard, but the gates of the political graveyard are open for him because he failed to act.</P>

      <P>The measured tones in which the debate is being conducted are appropriate. Everybody on this side of the House would prefer that precious and limited Private Members' time could be devoted to one of the major issues of the day. Unfortunately, the Government's inaction has provoked this debate and there is very little that the Opposition can do. Debate is now <Col N="86" /> unavoidable because what has been said cannot be allowed to stand on the record without some censure. Parliamentary privilege is a precious construct and its abuse a serious transgression to which the Dáil cannot turn a blind eye. It is a privilege conferred by the Constitution for the very good reason that a Member can represent his or her constituents without fear or favour. It is ironic if by the actions of one of our own Members a privilege conferred by the Constitution can be impeded by the conduct of one of our own elected Members. If it were to be ignored by this House, it would establish a precedent. This is a gross abuse, by common consent on both sides of the House, of parliamentary privilege and if left to rest on the record of the House, any Member could come in, make any baseless allegation, no matter how outrageous or unfounded, and return the following day and say &ldquo;I'm sorry. I withdraw that&rdquo;. That simply is not acceptable in terms of why that privilege has been conferred by the Constitution in the first place.</P>
      <P>In this case the abuse seemed entirely incidental to the debate but was, nonetheless, considered, calculated, deliberate for all of that. The debate last Wednesday night was of fundamental public importance. Deputy Higgins has has referred to the grave nature of the issues involved in terms of confidence in the Garda, the abuse of one family's rights, the oppression of that family, the destruction of its livelihood and the attempt, apparently and allegedly, to frame one of its members for the crime of murder. It could scarcely be more serious than that and, despite that, this distraction was thrown into the middle of it. The gravamen of that accusation remains on the record of the House to this moment. The gravamen of the accusation has not been withdrawn by Deputy Gildea. He has compounded the offence. He has refused on three occasions the opportunity provided to him to withdraw the essence of the worst part of that accusation.</P>
      <P>I refer to the judgment of Mr. Justice Geoghegan in the case of the Attorney General <i>v</i>. The Honourable Mr. Justice Hamilton Sole Member of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, in terms of the importance attached to the privilege conferred by the Constitution on Members and why. Mr. Justice Geoghegan states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard it is relevant to note the absolute immunity conferred on members of each House of the Oireachtas by Article 15.13, which provides that the members shall not in respect of any <i>utterance</i> in either House be <i>amenable</i> to any Court or any authority other than the House itself. That means I think a Tribunal such as this, though it has great powers, is still an agent of both Houses for a specific task and is not in the position and has not the powers to discipline a member which is possessed by each House. So if a Dáil Deputy is summoned before this Tribunal to explain utterances made by him in the House he is no more amenable to it than he is to any Court. <Col N="87" /> Not only can he not be disciplined; he cannot be made to explain to his utterances. He could not be made answerable to any Court for this utterances in the House even if he had been guilty of the grossest contempt of Court. He could affect the most serious criminal trial but could not be attached for contempt of Court in respect of something said in the House. That is unlikely ever to occur, but none the less it gives an idea of the extent of the immunity that members of each House possess.</P>
    <P>That sums up the privilege. Central to that finding by Mr. Justice Geoghegan is his conviction and that of the court that such a Deputy is amenable in this House if there is a gross abuse of privilege according to the rules of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Seamus Brennan, told several elements in the media earlier that he does not know what is the problem because Deputy Gildea has come into the House on two occasions and apologised. That is similar to what the Taoiseach said when he opened Senator Dan Kiely's constituency office last Thursday, a working day. He said he could not understand what was the problem because Deputy Gildea had come into the House, withdrawn his statement and apologised. If that was the case, what was Deputy Brennan doing for the past 48 hours trying to extract a statement in the House tonight from Deputy Gildea? What was the point of trying to get him to come in here and make a full statement and a full withdrawal if it is now the view of the Government that he has already complied with that?</P>
    <P>I was in the House when this happened along with my colleagues, Deputies Howlin and Quinn. I heard and I saw what happened. Nobody in this House has greater respect than I for the extraordinary quality, skill and speed of the work of our parliamentary reporters. I do not know to which authority of the House I ought to address this but it is matter of some concern that in recent years there has been a growing tendency, presumably at the direction of someone, to alter the record of the House by inserting the terms &ldquo;interruptions&rdquo; where perfectly audible interventions are made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a growing pattern in recent years which distorts the record of the House and ought not be permitted, as has been remarked on by a number of media people who watched the debate. Deputies Howlin and Quinn will testify to this. I made several interventions at the time pleading first with Deputy Gildea but, latterly, with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to intervene. I do not know which constitutes the record of the House, the television representation of it or the transcript, but it is something we ought to clear up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know as well that we have taken to elaborately edit some of the verbal infelicities of some <Col N="88" /> Members of the House, even some in senior office. It reaches a stage where it is no longer an accurate record of what is said in the House. That is wrong and requires to be addressed. In this case Deputy Gildea had plenty of opportunity to desist from what he was embarked on but he was embarked on it deliberately and calculatedly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>In that situation it is important that should be on the record of the House otherwise it distorts what happened. A totally baseless charge was apparently incidentally tossed into a debate but at the same time tossed in in a deliberate and premeditated fashion.</P>
      <P>I do not know why we had such an untypical outburst. I do not know why the use of language by Deputy Gildea was so untypical. I do not say that Fianna Fáil wrote the script for him but the old test of <i>cui bono?</i> is a good one. Who benefited from this gross distraction during one of the more serious motions that had been tabled in the House for a long time by Deputies Howlin and Shatter? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform obviously benefited from his performance and lamentable negligence on this issue. It was a distraction and was treated as such in the media over the weekend. Deputy O'Donoghue refused, although express claims were made to him, to intervene, even though as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform he knew exactly the import of what was happening. I regret that he displayed a great deal of pleasure.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there are a number of Ministers associated with the fact that the situation has worsened. Deputy O'Donoghue sat on his hands, seemed to invite it and certainly did nothing to discourage Deputy Gildea. The Tánaiste seemed paralysed and unable to respond to the simple request for a one hour debate that would have disposed of this matter. We were told throughout the weekend that we could rely on the Minister of State, Deputy Seamus Brennan, and that he would fix it. It appears he not has not fixed it and, furthermore, it looks like he has lost 25% of his entire portfolio in looking after Tom, Jack, Harry and Mildred. While we are in this situation the Taoiseach decided to open yet another pub. How there can be more unopened pubs in the Taoiseach's constituency is beyond me. He can absent himself on Wednesday. He can head off on Thursday to open a constituency office on a piece of road that Deputy Spring caused to be built in Tipperary North and the heir apparent, the dauphin from Cork, can come into the House and lecture the Opposition for not being prepared to sit on Friday. It is a fantastic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is regrettable and throws light on the role of the Independents who have extraordinary access to the holders of office. They do not seem to have to learn the rules of the House or learn their way around the House. I thought they met with the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, once a week to get their riding instructions. It <Col N="89" /> now seems they meet with him to give him his riding instructions. A dedicated Civil Service corps is devoted to their every beck and call. While the rest of us do constituency work, a dedicated corps of civil servants exists to guide the Independents around the House any time the Minister is not available.</P>
    <P>This was a Faustian pact between the Government and Deputy Gildea to renege on his own constituents, the people of Donegal. It was an issue of the most fundamental importance to the citizens of Donegal. Deputy Gildea had given a commitment to the Diver family and the McBrearty family on how he would act and vote in this House. In order to distract attention, he came to this House and for the first time in four and a half years made a calculated assault and an attempt at character assassination of Deputy Owen, for which he did not produce one shred of evidence, while her successor in office sat happily on his hands and did not interfere. That is a most grievous situation. Throughout the weekend, the media generally expressed it in those terms. I heard one radio reporter say that the we conducted ourselves like children here last week. If any member of the media in this House had such an allegation of criminality made against him or her, he or she would leave the gallery, there would be a picket by the NUJ on the gate and I would be with them on that picket. It is important that the media reflect on what was alleged in this House. Otherwise one could just bring down the shutters, stumble in later at night or the next day saying &ldquo;there is so much pressure on me . . . I want to finish my script . . . can I apologise?&rdquo; and that is the end of the matter. It is important that space is created &ndash; I agree with the Tánaiste on this matter &ndash; for robust political debate and exchange in this House. That is not the same as <i>ad hominem</i> personalised attacks such as Deputy Gildea engaged in. Therefore, it is important there is some sanction and that there is seen to be some sanction. Having to take up so much valuable Private Members' time is wrong. The matter could have been disposed of in one hour. It ought to have been disposed of in one hour, but because of the Faustian pact between the Deputy and the Government, it cannot let him down. It bought his vote, he stays bought, and the Government cannot concede the hour for the motion of censure the situation required.</P>

      <P>I am not here this evening looking for a pound of flesh nor am I here to do Deputy Gildea down. I want to make a contribution which I hope will bring some balance to this dispute. I know Deputies Gildea and Owen, both of whom I believe to be decent people. What I would like to do here this evening is to establish the facts as I know them. I was at the Whips' meeting at the time and I must say, all of us were quite shocked at the contribution, including the Government Chief Whip. I subsequently saw Deputy Gildea in the Chief Whip's office and I believe he was very confused. The Chief Whip asked him to withdraw the remarks. I do not believe it was a Fianna Fáil plot as Deputy Rabbitte said. I do not believe Fianna Fáil wrote the speech because it was a hand-written speech which he wrote himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it was a very serious abuse of Dáil privilege which we cannot tolerate. That is why I support the motion of censure. It is incumbent on Deputy Gildea to make a personal statement because his remarks were extremely damaging to a Deputy in this House. All of us could find ourselves in a similar situation at some stage. If some Deputy is so irresponsible as to stand up and make base charges against another, there is nothing we can do and the allegation can stand. What compounds it is not the fact that it is said in this House but that it can be reported in the radio, press, television and be on the front pages of newspapers. As it is not libellous, it could go on for days and days and in the meantime the person's reputation is ebbing away. That is not acceptable. Another reason it is so damaging is that politics now stands at such a low ebb, people will say to themselves there is no smoke without fire and so on. We have tried to do something over the years to deal with that situation. I call on Deputy Gildea to come in here and make that statement. It will not cost him anything but it will help this House enormously. We need clarity in this House because clearly Deputy Gildea was <Col N="91" /> confused. He did not know what to do next. The Ceann Comhairle can play a role by coming in and making clear to the Deputy what to do. Perhaps there should be a meeting of Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The rules need to be laid down so that there is an immediate retraction and fulsome apology showing that what was said was completely unsubstantiated. We can get our act together in this House in this regard.</P>
    <P>The next election will be fought on the whole area of integrity within politics. I note with some interest the selection of the new Fine Gael candidate in Dublin South East. I am sure Deputy Fitzgerald has also noted it with some interest. On the issue of integrity, I hope Fine Gael will learn something from the Green Party, and I say this to the new candidate in Dublin South East. The Green Party has not ever accepted a corporate donation. We have not accepted donations from developers or banks. In fact, when a bank sent us a donation it was sent back immediately. We have stuck by that policy. I hope other parties will learn from that. If the next election is fought on the issue of integrity in politics, people will see that the Green Party has lived up to its word. We do not just talk about it, we do it. People should consider what happened in Dublin County Council on the issue of rezoning. When my colleague, Deputy Sargent, received a cheque from a developer and asked did anyone else receive one of these, he was rounded on. He was verbally abused and physically attacked. This House needs to clean up its act and get clarity on Standing Orders so that we do not have a repeat of that which went on here last week. That is why the Green Party will be accepting this motion of censure.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ndash;noting that Deputy Thomas Gildea has withdrawn allegations made in Private Members' time on Wednesday, 21 November 2001, as formally requested to do so by the Ceann Comhairle;</P>
      <P>&ndash;noting that Deputy Thomas Gildea has apologised to the House, to Deputy Nora Owen, to her family and her party, in Dáil Éireann on Thursday, 22 November;</P>
      <P>&ndash;noting that the present practices and procedures of the House have been complied with in this regard,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> accepts Deputy Gildea's withdrawal and apology as is the custom and precedent by Members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I wish to make clear where the Government stands on this issue. These remarks should not have been made by Deputy Gildea. There is no foundation or substance to them and we join in the apology to Deputy Owen, her family and her party for any hurt caused. We are totally satisfied that there is absolutely no foundation whatsoever to the allegations. It is for that reason I wish to make clear to Deputy Owen that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats join in that apology to her.</P>
    <P>The amendment notes that Deputy Gildea has withdrawn the allegations made in Private Members' time on 21 November as formally requested by the Ceann Comhairle. It notes that Deputy Gildea apologised to the House, Deputy Owen, her family and her party on 22 November. It further notes that the present practices and procedures of the House, as far as we are concerned, have been complied with in this regard. For those reasons, we have asked that the Dáil accept the withdrawal given by one of its Members, accept the custom and practice of the House and accept Deputy Gildea's apology. That is a request in the amendment which is put to the House.</P>
    <P>I have never had an interest in trading insults with members of the Opposition about any issue. I have always believed in doing my job and dealing with criticism in the ordinary way. The trading of insults across the floor on these and other issues has added substantially to the damage to political life. One of the effects is that the other party Whips and I have been engaged in Dáil reform measures for some time and we hope to bring those to fruition very shortly. It is worth noting that six or seven measures under the broad heading of &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; have been endorsed, with very little division, by the House over the past 12 months. Those measures will add considerably to the betterment of politics and will enhance political life substantially.</P>
    <P>A lot of hard words have been said in this Chamber over the years. I do not want to dig out precedents about statements that had to be withdrawn. I invite Members to look back over the record and take note of the things said. Some of the statements were extremely harsh, personal and hurtful to family and friends, but the Ceann Comhairle intervened and the remarks were withdrawn. In many cases no apology emanated. People were called liars&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support the Government's amendment to the motion before the House to censure Deputy Tom Gildea. I have known Deputy Gildea since I came to this House and for some time previous to that. He represents his constituents to the best of his ability and with great commitment. At times one can get frustrated about what takes place in one's own area and when Deputy Gildea made the statement that he did last Wednesday night relating to Deputy Nora Owen, it was one such occasion.</P>
      <P>The fact that Deputy Gildea withdrew his offensive statement when requested to do so by the Ceann Comhairle and subsequently apologised to Deputy Owen, her family and her party fulfilled the requirements of courtesy and proper ethics of this House. Deputy Owen has over the years been harassed, as people may or may not know, on issues that Deputy Gildea felt strongly about in his own area. This may have contributed to his comments. This is not the first time that we have seen incidents like this arise in the House and while I agree that the statement should not have been made, the withdrawal and apology were genuine and unreserved in their content and should have been accepted in the same genuine spirit in which they were made. I therefore unreservedly support the Government's amendment to the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>As both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste pointed out on Thursday, the Government has been unequivocal in stating that these comments should not have been made and it is correct that they have been withdrawn and accompanied by an apology. I join the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brennan, who spoke earlier in this debate, in expressing my regret and sympathy to Deputy Owen on the unfounded allegations and gross abuse of parliamentary privilege which took place in this House last Wednesday evening.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that the privilege of speaking in this House and the absolute protection it enjoys under the Constitution imposes a co-relative duty on us to respect that and to ensure that, in our procedures, abuse of it does not take place. It has long been the precedent in this House that a Deputy who makes such an allegation is asked to withdraw it. Deputy Gildea withdrew the comments and subsequently apologised. I regret the fact that there was a delay between his withdrawal and his apology, but he did do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition is fully aware that the appropriate step to be taken if they wish this matter to proceed further is to refer it to the Committee <Col N="96" /> on Procedure and Privileges. That procedure was adopted when a Fine Gael Deputy made unfounded attacks on the President of the High Court, the Attorney General and the Judiciary in 1994. If this procedure was acceptable to Fine Gael when a statement by a Deputy of theirs was in dispute, it is hard to see why this procedure is not acceptable in relation to an independent Deputy like Deputy Gildea.</P>
    <P>The matter is very clear in Standing Orders and in salient rulings of the House. Deputy Rabbitte used the expression &ldquo;a gross abuse of parliamentary privilege&rdquo; in the course of the debate. I do not disagree with that characterisation of what happened, but the salient rulings of the Chair on this point are very clear in stating that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is the proper place to discuss gross breaches of privilege. That ruling goes back to 1932 and has been reiterated many times in this House. When there is an abuse of privilege and the Member does not withdraw, the option for the Chair is to permit the offended party, by way of motion, without notice to refer the matter immediately to the Committee. That did not happen on this occasion and I do not fault or criticise Deputy Owen, who quite rightly came into this House and defended her reputation on the instant. That is the proper procedure to follow.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it is improper for the principal Opposition party, Fine Gael, to institute a boycott of Dáil Éireann. Taken together with their earlier decision to boycott the National Forum on Europe, where essentially the federalist case has now gone by default, we are dealing with a principal Opposition party who are not addressing serious political issues that must be debated in our public life. I am not clear whether Deputy Noonan has disavowed his earlier suggestion that Deputy Gildea's comments were written as part of a Government conspiracy. I welcome the intervention of Deputy Gormley, who has personally satisfied himself on this matter by examining the texts of the speech. There is no question of there being a concerted conspiracy on the part of the Government in the production of Deputy Gildea's speech. Indeed, as Deputy Blaney pointed out, this is a matter about which Deputy Gildea felt very strongly and expressed those feelings wrongly and deplorably in his form of utterances.</P>
    <P>I call on Deputy Noonan, if he has not already done so, to withdraw the charge that there was a concerted effort by the Government to produce this speech. His refusal to acknowledge this undermines his stated intention to ensure that unsubstantiated allegations are not made. We cannot have one rule for one Deputy and one rule for another. The suggestion by Deputy Noonan is far less in gravity than what Deputy Gildea said and I am not suggesting otherwise. We can all make strong allegations in the heat of the moment and Deputy Gildea has withdrawn them, accompanied by an apology. The entire transaction is most regrettable but the Minister of <Col N="97" /> State is correct in the amendment to the motion which he has tabled.</P>
    <P>We must see if the practices of this House are inadequate to deal with this problem &ndash; and they have been looked at in recent years &ndash; and revisit them. Perhaps the provision in Standing Orders whereby the Member has the discretion to inform the Chair if he intends to make a statement which is potentially defamatory should be looked at again in terms of imposing an obligation on Members who have a fixed intention of making such statements. The procedure proposed by the Chief Whip, the amendment to the motion, is correct in terms of the traditions and precedents that must apply in this House.</P>

      <P>Much has been said and more has been written about the debate that took place in this House last Wednesday. It is important that this fact be stated clearly. Prior to the commencement of last Wednesday's debate, Deputy Owen had an unblemished reputation for honesty. At the conclusion of the debate that reputation was not diminished nor was it in doubt. It is not in doubt today nor is it in any way the subject matter of this debate. The subject matter is the manner in which this House regulates its own affairs. Article 15.10 of Bunreacht na hÉireann states that each House will make its own rules and Standing Orders with power to attach penalties for their infringement. It is necessary, having regard to the week that has passed, for it to be clearly understood that the regulation of the business of this House is exclusively a matter for this House.</P>
      <P>Others may comment but we, the democratically elected representatives, make the decisions. We are answerable in respect of our decisions only to the electorate and not to any intermediate body. It is important that this House is consistent in that we are not seen impulsively to change the rules or make them up as we go along. The issue we must address tonight is what, if any, action is appropriate to be taken by this House against a Deputy who makes a false accusation, withdraws the allegation and subsequently apologises. Happily such allegations are rarely made.</P>
      <P>One of the exceptions related to remarks made by Deputy Jim Mitchell in Dáil Éireann on Wednesday 23 March, 1994. Deputy Mitchell made certain comments which impugned the independence of the Judiciary making particular reference to then President of the High Court and the sole member of the judicial inquiry into the meat industry and cast serious doubts over the impartiality of his report on the tribunal which was then under preparation. Furthermore, he made a very serious attack on the then Attorney General and questioned his fitness for office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter was referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which accepted Deputy <Col N="98" /> Mitchell's apology, the allegation made by him in regard to each of the three areas outlined to be unreservedly withdrawn and reported to Dáil Éireann accordingly. That did not mean that the false allegations were not made; they were left to linger and fester on the record of the House before being withdrawn. An apology was tendered and that was the end of the matter. We heard no demand for censure. Indeed I do not remember a call by the Labour Party for Deputy Rabbitte to be rebuked or censured when then President of the High Court and subsequent Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Hamilton, found after inquiry that a serious allegation made in this House about another Member of this House by Deputy Rabbitte was &ldquo;baseless&rdquo;. Why is it necessary to change the rules now?</P>

The answer, of course, is that he did not because it is nonsense to suggest that there was ever such a rule or such <Col N="99" /> a duty.

      <P>The reality, as everybody with even a scintilla of knowledge of the law knows, is that it is not possible for me to ask that a public inquiry be established while the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is independent in the exercise of his functions, is deciding whether or not to charge people. It is not possible for me to establish a public inquiry while people are charged before the criminal courts of this country. It would not be possible even if the McBrearty family were to withdraw all of their civil claims. They are not the only people with civil claims.</P>
      <P>There have been criminal procedures in place in this State for a protracted period of time. These have stood the test of time and have been honoured by men like John Costello and Dr. Garret Fitzgerald.

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Alan Shatter, Nora Owen, Gerry Reynolds and Tom Hayes.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brennan, said during his contribution that many hard things are said in this House in the course of political debate. I agree with him. Members, from time to time, say hurtful things about each other and make allegations that are untrue or simply go over the top. The remarks are withdrawn, usually immediately, and that is the end of the matter. Deputy Gildea's performance here last Wednesday night, however, was quite different. It requires a different kind of approach from the House.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday night, Deputy Gildea found himself between a political rock and a hard place. He had to decide whether to vote as his constituents and fellow county people would have wished him to, to support the Opposition motion calling for a public inquiry into the McBrearty affair, or whether to honour his deal with Fianna Fáil and vote with the Government. It was a dilemma with which many Members will identify &ndash; loyalty torn between constituency and party or, in this case, the private deal with the party. Unlike most Deputies who have found themselves in this uncomfortable position, however, Deputy Gildea chose not simply to explain and argue the reason for his vote, however difficult. Instead he chose, perhaps with help or advice, to calculatedly set out to damage the good name and reputation of another Member in order to distract attention from his own shabby voting intentions.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday night Deputy Gildea did not go over the top in the heat of battle. He came in with a thought-out speech prepared in advance and making the most serious accusations, some of them allegations of criminal activity, against Deputy Owen which &ndash; on his own admission since &ndash; he knew to be untrue. His half-hearted and belated withdrawal and subsequent apology for those allegations does not wipe the slate clean. These actions came only after he was apparently advised to do so by the Government Chief Whip and they are therefore as politically expedient as the approach which caused him to make the allegations in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House should censure Deputy Gildea for these remarks for a number of reasons. First, because of his abuse of the privilege of the House in order to protect himself from the redress which would normally be open to any citizen for the accusations he made against Deputy Owen. <Col N="103" /> Second, so that the House can collectively assert that we will not support or tolerate unfounded allegations made by one Member against another under the privilege of the House or against people outside the House.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper that public servants, whether elected or appointed, should be called to account for their behaviour. However, there is a growing belief in recent times, perhaps in the wake of the tribunals, that it is open season on politicians &ndash; that any kind of base motive can be attributed to any person who serves the public through elected office and that any kind of allegation can be levelled with no comeback. It is regrettable that a Member should have chosen to go down this road and it is time we put paid to that notion.</P>
    <P>The third reason we should address this relates not so much to the question of conspiracy as to where the speech came from but rather to the pattern Deputy Gildea's speech follows. In recent times there has been a pattern of a new and perhaps successful debating tactic being adopted by some Ministers to rebut Opposition criticism. The new approach is to ignore the substance of the Opposition criticism and to lash out instead at Opposition Deputies. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, used the tactic last year when he attacked Deputy Owen to distract attention from the public apology he was forced to give to another Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, regarding the deregulation of taxis. The Minister for Public Enterprise used the same trick some weeks ago when she turned her own disastrous performance on public transport and enterprise &ndash; Aer Lingus, Eircom and Luas: the litany is quite long &ndash; into snap, crackle and pop slapstick which the fourth estate found much more hilariously funny than pensioners who have lost their savings on Eircom shares or commuters who are stuck in city traffic. Whether Deputy Gildea was taking a leaf from the O'Dea-O'Rourke style of parliamentary debate or whether he had assistance in crafting his speech we perhaps will never know. However, unlike Deputies O'Dea or O'Rourke he went further than the normal political charges, however funny or not, which are levelled in this House and he entered the realm of personal attack.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gildea twice did a disservice to his constituents last Wednesday. The first was by voting against the motion supporting a public inquiry into the McBrearty affair. The second was that by the attack and tactic he used to distract attention from that, he succeeded in deflecting public attention from what is a serious issue which is very important to the people of his county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the events in the House last Wednesday evening, nobody who heard Deputy Gildea's utterances or observed the way he conducted himself could draw any conclusion other than that he was engaged in a calculated <Col N="104" /> and cowardly attack on a Member of the House. The most serious allegations were made against Deputy Owen, allegations in respect of which there was not a scintilla of truth.</P>
      <P>As for how the House should deal with the matter, it is worth recalling that when Deputy Gildea was first asked if he would withdraw the statements he made, he said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Then he asked to be allowed to continue with his speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no question of him withdrawing, having suddenly realised the enormity of what he had said. The House was adjourned and I recall walking past the Chief Whip's office when Deputy Gildea, having left the House with greater haste than usual, was in there discussing his script and what he should do next.</P>
      <P>The Government is being disingenuous in suggesting that the apology necessary from Deputy Gildea was forthcoming. He withdrew the allegations under protest. He apologised in the House to Deputy Owen and her family but he did not do something that both the Chief Whip, Deputy Brennan, and Deputy O'Donoghue belatedly did here this evening. The Chief Whip said: &ldquo;There is no foundation and no substance to the remarks of Deputy Gildea.&rdquo;  We are asking that Deputy Gildea come to the House and say expressly that there was no truth, no foundation and no substance to the allegations he so calculatedly delivered but Deputy Gildea has declined. He has lacked the courage to do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue was sitting in the House when these events occurred last Wednesday. I was briefly out of the Chamber and observed them on the screen in my room, then I returned to the Chamber. I asked Deputy O'Donoghue to disassociate himself from the remarks of Deputy Gildea and to intervene with the Ceann Comhairle. He was asked to consider the approach to be taken by the Government and to disassociate himself from what was said. Deputy O'Donoghue sat silently in the House like the cat who just had the cream put in front of him, with a self-satisfied expression, delighted, in effect, that the focus attaching to him&mdash;</P>

For a Deputy so driven, his presence hangs like Banquo's ghost over this evening's proceedings. He has not even had the courage to come into the House to listen to Members' contributions and make a contribution to restore his own reputation rather than Deputy Owen's. The reality is that Deputy Gildea is a very special Deputy, a fact underlined by the contribution of Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brennan. Deputy Brennan properly disowned Deputy Gildea's remarks but spent part of his extraordinary contribution love bombing Deputy Gildea to ensure he remains part of the gang of four which supports the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>He has attempted to change his style as a Minister but tonight he returned to the bombast. A challenge relating to the McBrearty affair was issued to the Minister in the House last week which he refused to accept and it was reiterated this evening by Deputies Noonan and Jim Higgins. While the Minister addressed aspects of the affair, he has studiously avoided dealing with one particular issue. We now know that in October 1997, the Minister received a request from the Donegal district coroner to exhume the body of the late Richie Barron. We now know that some six days later the Minister was asked <Col N="107" /> by the Garda to put that request on hold and we know it was four years later when the Minister finally admitted to the House that he had received such a request and did not proceed to order an exhumation. Why, in the plethora of Dáil questions tabled by Deputies Howlin, Higgins and myself, did the Minister not inform the House over a four year period that the possibility of an exhumation arose directly as a result of an application from the Donegal district coroner in October 1997? Why, with all of the subsequent controversy which occurred, did he not ask the Garda Síochána why it first applied to the district coroner for an exhumation order and why, after the coroner applied to the Department, the gardaí asked him to put the application on hold?</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister never investigate or pursue this matter? Will he inform the House whether he questioned the Garda Commissioner about this matter or made contact with the garda who first sought the exhumation order and subsequently requested it be put on hold to ask him why the Garda changed its mind? These are serious questions which the Minister has refused to answer for the second week running. It is regrettable that so much time must be taken up with Deputy Gildea's contribution when the Minister has refused to answer questions on an issue of serious public concern.</P>

      <P>The great parliamentarian, Edmund Burke, who is often quoted in this House, said in 1789 &ldquo;an event has happened upon which it is difficult to speak and impossible to be silent&rdquo;. The matter we are discussing here this evening is such an event. My fervent wish is that I could turn the clock back to 7 p.m. on 21 November 2001 and live the life I was leading then as a robust parliamentarian whose good name was intact.</P>
      <P>I accept that Deputy Gildea withdrew his comments in a qualified manner. I accept that he apologised to me and my family for the hurt caused but the sad fact is that, because our utterances in this House are reported with privilege, the media had the right to repeat everything Deputy Gildea said. For the past six days I have had to defend my good name, something I did not have to do at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, 21 November. Deputy Gildea may well have been hounded too and may not have had a very pleasant six days because of what he said but I cannot imagine that the hurt he feels comes anywhere close to mine.</P>
      <P>Members of the media were entitled to ask me questions because of Deputy Gildea's comments. Those very questions imply there was some truth in his comments although I know everything he said was untrue and unfounded and that he does not have a scintilla of evidence to sustain it. I have spent the past six days fending off people who mean well, making jokes about this matter such as &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Who were you working for?&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> However, there was a silver lining to last Wednesday's events and I want to sincerely thank my colleagues in the Labour Party, the Green Party and, particularly, the Fine Gael Party for their immediate support when those outrageous allegations were made. The spontaneity of that support and people's belief that the allegations were untrue will stay with me. Many Fianna Fáil Members have also offered their support, particularly Deputy Power who, when we asked the Government to bring this terrible saga to a speedy end with some reflection of good on the House, had the courage to support our request.</P>
    <P>I am confused. Ministers uttered words of comfort here this evening&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;but ruined them by going on to refer to our mock indignation and early electioneering. This is a serious matter. Today I find myself in the eye of the storm, put there by Deputy Gildea who I wish was present so that I could look at him and make him realise how hurtful and damaging his actions were. I stand here for all Members, present and future, because if what happened to me, and the manner of its withdrawal, is allowed to stand, we will rue this day and some other Member will suffer as I have suffered, as Mr. Doyle has suffered and as the Garda has suffered by the allegation that I could have ordered it to follow a particular course of action and that it could not tell me it could not do so.</P>
      <P>I thank all those who have supported me in my hour of need. I ask Deputy Gildea to come to the House and explain himself. I am not responsible for his anger at something that happened in County Donegal. If this is how he pays me for his anger today, he may pay someone else in the same way tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I hope this debate will be conducted in a manner which reflects well on the House and on all present and future Members.</P>

    </P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in presenting the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Bill, 2001 to Dáil Eireann today. It is an essential element of the Government's strategic approach to the development of public-private partnerships. The events of 11 September and the international economic slowdown will impact on the Irish economy and could affect investment decisions across a range of sectors. However, it is in precisely these uncertain economic conditions that the PPP process can come into its own, with its principles of reduced risk to the taxpayer and value for money.</P>
    <P>The Bill is enabling legislation. Its aim is to facilitate the implementation of Government policy in respect of PPPs. That policy envisages the development of pilot projects across a range of sectors. The Bill facilitates that process. It reflects the Government's determination to harness the potential of PPPs to contribute positively to the delivery of priority economic infrastructural projects under the national development plan. Most importantly, it offers the high level of legal certainty sought by investors wishing to embark on this new method of public procurement. I am not asking the House to make any new policy statement in relation to PPPs. I am, however, asking for its support for the Bill which will ensure State authorities will have the opportunity to engage in PPPs.</P>
    <P>PPPs represent a growing trend across developed market economies. They represent the coming together of public services and private business. In some countries this is a new phenomenon. In Ireland we have not had State monopolies, for instance, in the provision of essential public services such as health and education. These services have always been funded and provided by a mix of central and local government, private, voluntary and community-based organisations. Moreover, many local authority services have been delivered through contract arrangements with the private sector. PPPs are consistent with these long-standing practices.</P>
    <P>Our experience of public-private co-operation naturally reflects our particular historical circumstances. It is also consistent with and supportive of policies directed towards greater integration of economies within the European Union and across the wider global economy.</P>
    <P>International experience clearly shows that real benefits can be gained from PPPs. They can give better value for money compared to traditional procurement by transferring risks from the public to the private sector. PPPs can deliver improved efficiency in the adoption of whole life costing of services and innovation in the design, building and operation of assets. PPPs can also provide better quality services through increased compe<Col N="110" /> tition, incentives to higher standards and performance and an enhanced focus on the customer. PPPs can allow faster delivery of individual projects by linking the provision of the asset or service to payments, particularly in relation to more complex capital projects. PPPs can give us a better utilisation of assets through extended third party usage and can provide the context for better regulation as Government agencies focus on the role of regulator, planner and monitor rather than day-to-day service provision. Moreover, PPPs can help maintain competitiveness through the opening up of sectors now sheltered from competition.</P>
    <P>While all international experience points to all these benefits, the crucial element of successful PPPs is optimal risk transfer. By this I mean that a good PPP will ensure project risks are allocated to the party best able to manage them at least cost.</P>
    <P>Our primary objective is to establish the procedures needed to capture the advantage of effective risk allocation through developing our pilot project programme. A well-managed PPP will be based on optimal risk transfer. Effective risk identification, assessment and allocation are crucial to achieving increased value for money for the Exchequer and the taxpayer. For the private sector an opportunity is created to engage in a long-term business relationship.</P>
    <P>The PPP unit in the Department of Finance is managing the standardisation of PPP procedures to ensure risks are evaluated in a consistent way across all sectors. For the public sector, this will ensure procuring authorities will have a sound basis for a rigorous qualification of risks to be transferred. The private sector partner will know that risk issues will be dealt with in a transparent and realistic way.</P>
    <P>A related benefit is that long-term cost factors are recognised in addition to the initial capital expenditure. There are real incentives to focus on a holistic approach in the amalgamation of the design, construction, finance and operation in the creation of an asset from a whole life perspective. A further advantage of PPPs is that the taxpayer only pays for the services actually delivered. The private sector firms and their bankers take the risk that where they are unable to provide the required level of service, they do not get paid.</P>
    <P>For small economies such as our own, an additional benefit of PPPs is that they can facilitate bigger and more complex infrastructural projects than would have been feasible under other arrangements. These larger projects become more attractive to major international design, construction and engineering firms. The entry of overseas competition to a smaller market can generate the transfer of competencies and management skills through co-operation and joint ventures.</P>
    <P>The Government will weigh the benefits of PPPs and analyse the potential difficulties and problems to be overcome in rolling out the PPP programme. Of course, we recognise that there <Col N="111" /> are obstacles that can create disadvantages in adopting PPPs. They can present difficult and complex contractual issues for both public and private sector partners. The public sector has to be satisfied that the business case for proceeding with a project on a PPP basis is sound when compared with the conventional approach.</P>
    <P>For the private sector, the costs associated with bidding for PPP projects can be substantial. However, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness specifically provides for negotiation in relation to the question of client contribution to PPP tender bid costs. For employees, significant issues can arise where public service staff are transferred to the private sector under PPPs. Discussions at the public-private advisory group will address these complex human resources issues.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise these issues. My approach is to ensure issues are resolved before they become problems, that problems are solved before they pose impediments to PPP projects and that impediments are removed by dialogue and agreement before they obstruct the successful delivery of PPP projects. However, I should stress that PPPs must not be seen as a means of avoiding more fundamental difficulties in individual projects. A project should stand on its own merits irrespective of the method of procurement.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the Government to PPPs is critical. Part of the reason we have made such good progress on PPP is that there has been solid Government support for it at the very highest level. This support is grounded in a clear appreciation of the economic case for PPPs and a focus on deliverables, based on a requirement for a sound business case evaluation. In this regard the structures for delivering PPPs is of crucial importance.</P>
    <P>The Government established a central PPP unit in the Department of Finance to lead, drive and co-ordinate PPP. There are also units with responsibility for individual sectors in relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet committee on infrastructure and PPPs gives high level direction to the development of PPPs. It includes the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance, the Attorney General and other senior Ministers. In addition, the head of the central PPP unit in my Department is chairman of two groups managing the PPP process: an interdepartmental group on PPPs which brings together key decision makers to ensure there is coherence and consistency in developing partnership arrangements with the private sector; and a public-private informal advisory group on PPPs which includes representatives of employer organisations, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the construction and civil engineering sectors and the National Enterprise Development, Science and Technology Innovation Board.</P>
    <P>These groups have already advanced the PPP process by helping to address and resolve major legal and financial questions. The IAG negotiated the framework for PPPs, which was formally <Col N="112" /> launched by the Minister for Finance in conjunction with the social partners earlier this month. The adoption of the framework is an acknowledgement that the delivery of projects through PPP gives us all an opportunity to maximise the interaction and co-operation between the public and private sectors. Agreement on shared goals, objectives, principles and the appropriate distribution of risks for public investment and services delivery is fundamental.</P>
    <P>The framework constitutes an important statement of the high level principles for the conduct of PPPs at national sectoral and project level that will help embed PPP as an important pillar of public capital procurement and the provision of quality public services. A major communications and awareness raising programme is being rolled out in the coming weeks by the central PPP unit of the Department of Finance with the assistance of the social partners. The aim of this programme is explain to stakeholders and the public what are PPPs and to allay many of the unfounded concerns about the PPP process.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a major step aimed at addressing a critical issue which has arisen in other jurisdictions in relation to the PPP process &ndash; that of certainty or the<i> vires</i> of public authorities to engage in public-private partnerships. In all countries where PPPs are in use as a public procurement option, it is recognised that the issue of legal capacity, or <i>vires,</i> of public authorities to enter into PPPs is crucial to their overall success. Investors in PPP projects require a high degree of legal certainty regarding the <i>vires</i> of public sector contracting authorities. The Bill was published with this in mind. It provides certainty as to the powers of State authorities to enter into PPPs and gives local authorities the power to enter into joint ventures.</P>
    <P>Although the purpose of the Bill is to verify that State authorities have the statutory powers to enter into new procurement arrangements, these powers supplement their existing powers already provided under relevant legislation. It is also important to note that traditional out-sourcing of contracts or arrangements whereby the private sector designs and constructs an asset for the public sector are not covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>While the Bill will be considered in detail by Members on Committee Stage, I will outline some of its important provisions. Section 1 deals with interpretation. This is a standard section containing definitions of words and phrases used throughout the Bill. Section 2 provides that the State authorities covered in the Bill are those named in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for, and thus defines, what is meant by the term &ldquo;public-private partnership arrangement.&rdquo; It gives statutory underpinning to the concepts of design-build-operate projects and design-build-operate and finance projects. It also provides that a State authority may arrange or provide for payments to a private sector partner and that the State authority has the power to contract with a person who has provided funding for <Col N="113" /> the public-private partnership arrangement. One of the benefits of PPP is that the State authority only pays for what it gets. This section allows for those financing the project to intervene or step in, if necessary, where the operator of a contract fails to deliver the required performance. A State authority may also form a company or become a shareholder in a company and may transfer an asset of the State authority to a partner. Under a public-private partnership arrangement, such a transfer would be for a defined period only.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the functions of a partner and State authority. It provides that the functions specified in the PPP arrangement may be conferred upon the partner. The partner may perform these functions in its own name subject to the control of the State authority. Notwithstanding this, the functions will continue to be vested in the State authority. The relevant Minister's responsibility for the performance of that function is not affected. Where a number of local authorities or bodies join forces to engage in a PPP, they may agree that their functions will be performed by a lead local authority or body.</P>
    <P>Section 5 covers the effect of public-private partnership arrangements. It gives retrospective authority to State authorities in respect of PPPs entered into prior to the entry into force in due course of the Bill. Section 6 covers directions. It authorises the appropriate Minister to give written directions to a State authority and a company formed to undertake a PPP project in relation to the management, accountability, accounting and financial affairs of that company. The section ensures the appropriate Government accounting procedures are adhered to during the PPP process and that the Accounting Officer of the relevant Department may, via the relevant Minister, take steps to ensure this is the case.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the appropriate Minister, may amend the Schedule by adding or deleting a public authority by way of order to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 8 is a standard provision allowing expenses incurred in the administration of the legislation to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 9 is also a standard provision dealing with the Short Title and providing that the Bill shall come into operation four weeks after it is passed. The Schedule lists the State authorities covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>A balance has been struck between, on the one hand, the needs and interests of the public sector and, ultimately, the Exchequer and, on the other, the private sector. Public-private partnership is a new departure and the Government is committed to the creation of an environment in which it can develop and flourish as a rewarding method of public procurement for all concerned. I have described how the process can help meet the significant infrastructural and other challenges posed by the NDP for our expanding economy.</P>
    <P>My main aim in introducing the Bill is to ensure sufficient certainty is created in relation to <Col N="114" /> the <i>vires</i> of State authorities to become involved in PPP projects. I hope the Bill can contribute to the creation of an environment that offers the private sector sufficient encouragement to participate in the many opportunities that exist for PPP in Ireland across a range of sectors, while at the same time safeguarding the interests of the Exchequer and, ultimately, those of the citizens. Public-private partnerships offer a &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; situation for all concerned and I am pleased to be associated with the Government's efforts to create the environment in which this new method of public procurement can flourish. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomes the Bill. We recognise the need for progress on public-private partnerships and will introduce amendments on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael is looking forward to returning to government and implementing a PPP programme that appears to have been set aside by this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government. There has been much talk about PPP, including press releases and affirmations that it would happen. However, to date very little has been done. For example, the PPP programme for the road from Kilcock to Kinnegad is already running approximately ten months behind schedule. The Government has created this problem. It did not proceed on time and failed to address outstanding issues in the correct manner. That is the reason for these long delays.</P>
      <P>I reiterate a commitment given last week by my party leader, Deputy Noonan, that on returning to government, Fine Gael will ensure the PPP programme is administered and will proceed as quickly as possible. Road construction is the most widely recognised area where PPP can be implemented, but it can also be implemented in waste management, water treatment and, perhaps, the provision of an infrastructure for the ailing health service. This aspect needs to be clarified and progressed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Public-private partnership appears to have acquired a bad name in the past and is seen to have originated in Thatcherite Britain. Many concerns privatised in Britain were not suitable for privatisation. The debacle involving the railways in the United Kingdom is an example. It has turned out a mess and we should learn from such mistakes. I was astonished to hear recently from somebody living in Manchester that a single train fare from Manchester to London on the new service being provided by the private sector is £128. This is as a result of the PPP, and it is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to return to PPPs in the context of the roads infrastructure and the long delay in bringing on stream the new road from Kilcock to Kinnegad and on to Galway, and many other such schemes throughout the country. Why has it taken so long to bring them on stream? What has caused the delays? Why is there such opposition to them from various quarters? A major reason for the delays is the way in which many of these <Col N="115" /> projects have been handled by the NRA. The NRA has been very poor in terms of communications. Sometimes farmers were not aware their land was being surveyed and on occasion people went on to their farms without permission. Sometimes farmers read in newspapers that routes had been selected before they had been consulted. The consultative process has been weak and poorly handled, and the NRA must take responsibility for this. They should take a leaf from the way in which communications have worked in relation to Luas. One can hardly pick up a paper without seeing generally positive vibes about Luas. It seems much consultation took place with regard to Luas and I wonder why the same has not happened for roads. Why has the NRA not handled things in a similar way?</P>
    <P>Another issue is landowners and how they are treated. There have been ongoing discussions between the IFA and the Department regarding how farmers should be treated. Many land owners have been devastated as a result of the severance of their land because of new road developments. I could cite many examples of farmers and farming families who legitimately feel they will be put out of business because of a road going through their property. It is easy for us to talk about it in the House and make laws and pass enabling legislation, but the Acting Chairman, who is from a rural area, has some appreciation of what it is like for somebody to feel their livelihood will be lost. For example, I know of a farming family with a small 50 acre farm. Ten of their best acres are being taken by way of compulsory purchase order, amounting to 20% of their total land holding How can such a farmer be compensated for future loss? There is opposition because of such uncertainties. It raises fundamental questions regarding compulsory purchase orders.</P>
    <P>The compulsory purchase order legislation dates back to 1919 when it was brought in mainly to acquire land to build houses for those who did not have houses. It was good for the public in general that such a system should be in place, and land was needed to provide accommodation for those who did not have any. The same compulsory purchase order legislation is now used to purchase land to enable major roads to be constructed which we are told will be funded under the PPP. The essence of a PPP is that public and private moneys will be invested. A company will decide to invest in a project on the basis that it will make money, and we have examples of how that worked. The toll bridges in Dublin, for example, worked very well and are now making a handsome profit. This morning I crossed the West Link toll bridge, and the toll there is now £1. Not too long ago it was 30p, so it is no wonder this investor is making a handsome profit.</P>
    <P>What will happen to land which is taken from a farmer by compulsory purchase order? It will be given to a private company to make a profit. This is very different from the initial idea of com<Col N="116" /> pulsory purchase orders. It also makes one wonder why a farmer who is forced to sell land is paid at agricultural land prices.</P>

      <P>If we are genuine about PPPs and want land owners to get a fair crack of the whip then, given that a development company will take over their property and use it to make profits, their land should be sold at development prices. If it was a housing or commercial development, farmers would be paid a certain price. However, up to now farmers have been paid quite meagre sums under compulsory purchase orders. Despite what the Minister has said the average price per acre received by farmers under the compulsory purchase order has been from £4,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other compensations built into the provisions, but my contention is that farmers or any landowners should be paid a proper rate. I am aware that negotiations are at an advanced stage with the IFA and that a programme has been worked out whereby farmers will get better compensation for their land. I understand the deal which has been worked out with the Government is that if a person loses, for example, six acres under the compulsory purchase order scheme, they will get a sum of money for the six acres in keeping with the price of a similar piece of land sold in the area. Recently I met a farmer who told me he will lose eight acres <Col N="117" /> under the compulsory purchase order scheme, and he said he was quite satisfied as there was a recent sale of eight acres in the locality for £162,000. That farmer is expecting to get £162,000 for his land under the new deal which I understand has been agreed by the Government, plus consideration for the severance, disturbance, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will confirm it. I understand it has also been agreed that there will be an early settlers clause to accommodate farmers who sign up early and agree to a particular road. I am all in favour of it. I understand the Government has offered £3,000 per acre under the early settlers clause and that the IFA is seeking £4,000 per acre. I am sure a compromise can be reached and that there will be agreement. Another big question, that is, the taxation of that money, is still in the melting pot.</P>
      <P>On the overall issue, the farmers and landowners have a legitimate claim. It is not fair to use a compulsory purchase order system for something that will, obviously, benefit a private company in a development context. I suggest some options for consideration in those circumstances. First, has the Minister of State considered the possibility that the landowners should be given an opportunity of becoming shareholders in the company that will provide the money and construct the road? In the case of Eircom and other State companies which have changed hands recently, there have been share options for the workers. Why not give the landowners concerned in this case the opportunity of taking a share in the company? Is that not possible and reasonable in the circumstances? In the context of future tolling of those roads, why not offer the farming families concerned the facility of travelling toll-free on those roads? I understand that a transponder can be installed in a car, which registers as one goes through the tolling station and provision could be made for exemption from payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is waxing lyrical in favour of payment. Is that in line with Fine Gael policy? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State is interested in what I am saying. I am trying to assist the Government to move ahead with the PPP programme. The Government has delayed the process and placed many obstacles in the way. It has not completed negotiations which it entered into with various groups and it has presided over the bulldozing of people's concerns in relation to route selection, negotiations and unacceptable impositions. I am trying to put in the way of the Minister of State the facilities by which, perhaps, he will be able to find a way out <Col N="118" /> of the mess the Government has got itself into and move forward.</P>
      <P>Tolling is part of the Kinnegad to Kilcock scheme &ndash; the toll has been set. In various replies to parliamentary questions, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has said he has no role in the tolling of roads. That is not true. The NRA sets the toll rate and so on, but it must get the approval of the Minister and, unless he approves it, it cannot go through. I question the concept of direct tolling because it will cause problems and will disadvantage certain parts of the country. In my area of County Westmeath, thank God we have an influx of people and our towns are growing rapidly. Many of those who live in places like Kinnegad, Killucan, Rathwire and Rochfortbridge are commuting daily to Dublin. I ask the Minister of State to consider the additional cost which will be imposed on them if they have to pay a toll each way on their journey to and from Dublin. Currently, it amounts to about £1.60 per trip, or £16 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are weekly tickets available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that information and I would ask the Minister of State to elaborate on it, including the cost. I hope it is a greatly reduced cost. Are the actions of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government part of a move to discourage people from commuting to work and driving them onto the rail system? If that is his intention, why does he not say so? The Government should consider the downstream effects of tolling in areas like Westmeath. That county is in the BMW region and, according to CSO projections, the midlands area is the one area which will have a population decline over the next 20 years. The north of the county is suffering a severe loss of population and we have recently lost industry. It is very important to bolster the opportunities in that area and boost industry so that it can survive and become competitive. In that context, I question whether direct tolling is the best way forward.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister of State investigated the possibility of shadow tolling, the effect it might have and the possibility of a more even spread of the burden of toll roads. People commuting from Kinnegad to Dublin already pay their taxes, part of which will go towards building the new dual carriageway. They would feel very aggrieved if they had to pay further taxes for the use of the road towards which they have already contributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>They could use the other road if they do not wish to pay the toll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>That suggestion is not valid. It would mean that people could not use a facility for which they had paid and that is not a fair proposition. The Minister of State should seriously consider shadow tolling in terms of how it would work and the effects it would have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> Local usage is an important issue. There was a great deal of discussion recently on the effects which a proposed toll road around Dundalk would have on the town and on local usage. The question was posed as to whether it would force traffic back into the town rather than have the desired effect of moving it out of the town. That aspect has to be considered. Shadow tolling is a real possibility and the Minister of State should consider it. Perhaps in his reply at the end of Second Stage, he will indicate if that has been considered and with what outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy spell out what he means by shadow tolling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose, for example, the Kilcock to Kinnegad road is built under a PPP arrangement, the private company involved will put up £X towards the project in a deal whereby it will get a return over a number of years. There will also be public money invested in the building of the road. There are two ways of recouping the private company's investment. It could apply direct tolling in the form of a fixed charge on every vehicle using the road or, alternatively, shadow tolling might operate as follows. If the company anticipates a return of £10 million per year over a number of years, that could be subsidised by way of shadow tolling from central Government, enabling the toll rate to be greatly reduced, possibly to a nominal level. There would be a top-up figure to maintain the level of return to the company at the specified level. If the turnover was £15 million, rather than the anticipated £10 million, the Government top-up would be correspondingly less and if the turnover was £8 million, there would be a greater top-up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>The risk is for the private company which put the money up front. Obviously, it will not be given a 100% return &ndash; it is a matter for negotiation. One arrives at the best arrangement.</P>
      <P>Another point relates to the quality of the roads being built. The standard of road proposed in my constituency is reduced dual carriageway. Reduced dual carriageway has two lanes of road on each side. There is no hard shoulder. This is a new concept in road design and road building.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, a Cheann Chomhairle. It is extremely important to achieve the highest safety standard on these roads. We must ensure the roads are of the best quality. I recently had a discussion with somebody from the NRA during a committee meeting in the House. He talked about the cost benefit analysis of building these roads and the number of accidents and possible deaths that would be prevented. I welcome that.</P>
      <P>Adopting the reduced dual carriageway standard as distinct from full dual carriageway or reduced motorway or motorway means there are different standards of safety attached to each road. Each has a higher standard of road safety. The motorway has the highest. On the other roads safety is compromised to a certain extent. A reduced dual carriageway has a lower safety standard than a full dual carriageway due to how it is built. On one there are two lanes on each side without a hard shoulder while the other has the hard shoulder. Accident statistics demonstrate that this difference results in a reduced safety standard. We must take that into account when we build our roads.</P>
      <P>The NRA indicated that the reason it opted for a reduced dual carriageway on a certain stretch of road was the possible additional cost. There would be additional costs in moving up to the next standard. That is a matter of fact, regardless of what anyone else tells the Minister. I hope he will respond to that point and outline his thoughts on the different standards of roads and how they can improve road safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suffering a little this evening so I will keep my contribution even quieter and more succinct than usual.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath said much that was of interest in the course of his contribution. I will discuss some of it later but I am provoked in particular by the first point he made about the compulsory purchase procedure. I will respond as an urban dweller and as a representative of an urban constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We drove the last pig from Dublin North-Central in the late 1970s and the farms have since been replaced by substantial housing estates. There are no farmers left in the area. Compulsory purchase is an issue where we have not got the balance right. There is a balance to be struck between the rights of landowners and private property owners and the requirements of the economy and the people. The compulsory purchase acquisition rules generally seem to be fair. I am not sure that the procedure is as efficient as it might be. There might be an argument for front loading it, that is, acquiring the land first and <Col N="121" /> working out the compensation later if that is what must be done. The rules, however, are fair.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered in recent months whether there would be the same decibel level in this debate if an IFA election were not due shortly. I would be disappointed and disturbed if the type of deal described by Deputy McGrath were suddenly announced in the next couple of weeks. We should not run the risk of doing damage to the way in which we have used compulsory purchase orders generally for social good for decades by making a once off fix at this stage, particularly when the Government has been slow to take a lead on this issue. Certainly, it has not done so in public. However, that is just an aside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are thankful. It is different from what Deputy Penrose would say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I emphasised that I made my point as a representative of an urban constituency. However, there is a balance to be struck here.</P>
      <P>The phrase public private partnerships or PPPs has become a buzz phrase which has been much in vogue over recent years. To comment on it in an intelligent way, we must have an agreed position as to what we are discussing. For me, a PPP is or should be a means whereby the public and private sectors can both give of their respective expertise in providing infrastructure or public services to the greatest possible benefit of customers, consumers or citizens. It is about the provision of public services or services to the public.</P>
      <P>It was and is the traditional left wing Labour Party view that it is the primary responsibility of the State to ensure that public services are provided to citizens and that most of that provision will be made directly by the State. That, however, does not exclude the possibility that there are and will be circumstances where the involvement of the private sector is not only appropriate but is also desirable. It is probably fair to say that most of the scepticism on the left, particularly in the past 15 years, about PPPs in Ireland results from the PFI experience in the United Kingdom where the then government under Mrs. Thatcher, now Lady Thatcher, introduced privatisation in a number of enterprises under the guise of PPPs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is probably fair to say also that the political motivation of that government, which was not seen to be in any way sympathetic to the provision of public services and certainly not direct provision of public services by the state, informed people's view of the process. That is important. It is impossible, having seen the process that government went through, to come to any other conclusion than that it was looking to take public services out of the realm of government and off the balance sheet. In many cases there was a sub-agenda, sometimes a more up front agenda, of casualising the work force, attacking the public service unions and making a political point by virtue of doing that. It sat alongside and frequently intersected with a massive programme of privatis<Col N="122" /> ation, some of which has been greatly discredited in recent years.</P>
    <P>The background to the debate in Ireland, therefore, has not been positive. Certainly, the Labour Party looked askance, particularly in the early 1990s, at the PPP proposals being made here as a result of its knowledge and experience of what had happened in the United Kingdom. I am reluctant to be negative but it is important to point out that I do not regard PPPs as privatisation or as being analogous to privatisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not support privatisation in a number of circumstances. I would not support the privatisation of most of the utilities that are still within public ownership in Ireland. I do not, for example, support the privatisation of a utility that is providing a service of strategic importance, where real competition in the market place might be difficult to achieve or to achieve at an acceptable cost. An example of such a case is the ESB. It appears to be accepted at present that in order to achieve competition in the market, it will be necessary for the regulator to agree on an increased price of electricity for customers. It cannot be reasonable to assert that we must, for ideological reasons, seek to bring other players into the market if the consumer is to be disadvantaged from the start by virtue of that fact. I cannot see that the case is persuasive in any way.</P>
      <P>I do not support privatisation where there is a universal service obligation which is virtually certain to clash with the profit motivation which lies behind most, if not all, private companies. If that happens, either one ends up compromising the universal service obligation or paying too much for it. To put that in more simple English: if one looks at a company such as the VHI, either it or Government comes under pressure to change the regulations in order that one does not have to make the provision for community care that is part of the regulations or legislation that governs the VHI. Alternatively, it must be subsidised and money given by direct subsidy to the VHI, BUPA or any other competitor in order to fulfil the obligation which was previously a given in terms of one State-owned insurance company. In those circumstances I cannot see that we, older people or those suffering from a chronic illness would benefit from the privatisation of the VHI.</P>
      <P>In many cases the difference between privatisation and using PPSs may actually come down to a matter of scale. A group water scheme in a rural area, for instance, in Deputy Connaughton's or Deputy McGrath's constituency, may be run by a co-op. Effectively, it is privately run. If it was on a larger scale, it might well be put out to what one might call a PPP and operated by a private contractor on the basis of an agreed contract. That, to all intents and purposes, is a PPP. In many cases it might well be the most efficient way in which to operate a scheme of that kind. I would actively support such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> That is quite different, however, from saying that one would take the water supply for a whole region or, for that matter, the entire country and simply privatise it. I note that there is no proposal to do so, but I want to draw a distinction. In such a case one would give discretion over an important public service to a company which one could, at best, look to regulate by way of statutory instrument or registration or regulation. Based on experience in other countries, I am not convinced that it can be done effectively and well. The smaller scale of a local group water scheme in a rural area may allow PPPs to work very well. I would have grave difficulty with the privatisation of whole networks on a grand scale.</P>
    <P>PPPs are project-orientated and governed or should be by contract. In many cases these contracts are quite explicit, detailed and complex. They require a great deal of negotiation. That is as it should be. It is important that in drawing up contracts of this kind with private operators the public body, whether it be the local authority or central government or the Department of the Environment and Local Government, should spell out in careful detail exactly what is required of the contractor. If the contractor is constructing a building, it should be made absolutely clear that it must be open 12 or 15 hours a day, for perhaps 364 days a year, and that a certain standard of service should be provided for the State or the users of the service. The contractual obligation of the contractor is central to the whole deal and of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>We must stress that there are, potentially, different types of PPPs, not all of which are new to this country. We have had &ldquo;design and build&rdquo;; &ldquo;design, build and operate&rdquo;; even the odd &ldquo;design, build, finance and operate.&rdquo; The so-called Dublin Bay project currently under way is being undertaken on a DBFO basis. A private operator is building the pipeline under the bay from Sutton to Ringsend and will provide for the tertiary treatment of sewage in Dublin from next year onwards. It seems to be a perfectly intelligent way of making use of expertise in an area where we clearly need it.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister and Deputy McGrath have said that politics is of some importance in relation to this issue and I agree. I was struck in reading some of the literature about PPPs that the consultants concerned believe that the political background was of some considerable importance in informing the market as to how the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Finance would want things to move. That is the most important distinction that can be drawn between the experience in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and the experience I hope will apply here.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGrath said, the Minister was slow to grasp the real potential of PPPs other than on a purely ideological level. I acknowledge there are signs that has now been done. I welcome the establishment of the unit within the Department of Finance. I have met officials of <Col N="124" /> the unit more than once and know them to be people driven by a mission. It will take some more time for this to filter down through the various line Departments and, more importantly, the local authorities, the NRA and various other State bodies which will ultimately deal with PPP projects. A good start has been made within the Department which I hope will serve to inform the rest of the process.</P>
    <P>Having made the distinction between PPPs and privatisation I will state what PPPs will give to the State and the citizen. I support the idea in principle. In the past we have perhaps been more fixated than we should have been on the whole business of asset ownership rather than the provision of services. Ultimately, it is the business of Government and the House to ensure services are provided on a decent basis for citizens. It is a matter for us to decide the basis on which citizens will have access to those services. In many cases we will ensure there is universal access. We must ensure it is done at the least possible cost to citizens. These are all matters for regulation and may be matters for legislation. They may, on occasion, require asset ownership, but we should also acknowledge that there are plenty of occasions on which actual ownership will not be required in order to ensure service delivery.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, the main argument in favour of PPPs was that it allowed services to be provided with an upfront payment. One can afford more now than could have been afforded in different circumstances. Ironically, since PPPs have become a real prospect in the last five years or so, that argument has not really held good. We have had plenty of money in the coffers to finance capital investment straight out of the Exchequer finances, but that is now beginning to change. The fiscal situation is nothing like as strong as it was even a year ago and it seems likely that we will have to borrow this year in order to fund some of the infrastructural projects which are part of the national development plan. That is necessary and should not in any sense discourage us from making that investment. The investment is not only needed, it has been needed for a long time. It would be deplorable if we were to hold back in any sense simply because we had to borrow. This of course changes our assessment of the monetary benefits. We must then compare the cost of borrowing the money up front with the cost to the State of making payments over a concessionary period of 30 years.</P>
    <P>This is a technical matter, but it is also of some importance in terms of value for money for the State. We must look at the premium we are paying in order to have services delivered over a period of years and compare it to the cost of borrowing. A premium of some kind is desirable from the point of view of private companies and inevitable from the point of view of the State. It would otherwise be impossible to attract private companies into the business. We must ensure the premium is of a reasonable level. Looking at the experience in the United Kingdom I am not sure <Col N="125" /> that it always was from the point of view of the public sector or the State.</P>
    <P>We will have difficulties in the next few years in terms of Structural and Cohesion Fund moneys which have been central to our infrastructural programme in the last decade. There is the matter of the stability and growth pact which, unfortunately, does not distinguish between capital and current spending.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, disagrees with me strongly on this matter, but I wish to repeat it. We should be among those in the European Union seeking to have the understood terms of the stability and growth pact changed. There is a central difference between borrowing for infrastructural investment and for current day-to-day spending. This has to be reflected in the Maastricht criteria and the stability and growth pact. If some of the bigger countries such as Germany or Italy are looking to take the lead in making that case, then Ireland should be supporting it. As the Minister knows, we do not need to do that just now as we are not currently in those circumstances but we might well be in five or ten years time and, given where we are starting from, we should make the argument up front.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument about risk is an essential core of this debate. It is all about risks and expertise. It is about transferring certain risks to the private sector, which they are best able to carry, and about using the expertise of the private sector in areas where they have greater expertise than the public sector.</P>
    <P>The area of roads is not a bad example here. Irish construction companies, by and large, are not geared up for the level of project that is now coming on stream here. We will need to buy in the foreign expertise as part of the delivery of the national development plan and the same is true of the project I referred to earlier, the Dublin Bay project, where we are buying in expertise on a scale that is not available to us here. In order to do that we need to look at different ways and structures of doing things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the Waterford-Kilmacthomas bypass which was recently delivered by a French company. It is already happening in advance of a more formalised approach to PPP. I agree with the Deputy that we would not be able to deliver on the NDP without their involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness we cannot transfer, nor should we seek to, all risk. There is a great debate as to whether one should transfer all planning risk to a contractor, whether delays which are effectively caused by delays in the planning system should be the responsibility of the contractor and if he should be exposed to financial penalties because of those risks. Given the way things work here it would be unreasonable to do that. It is reasonable to bring the contractor in at an earlier stage of the design system than we <Col N="126" /> typically do but it is not reasonable to ask them to carry that planning risk with the potential of financial penalties.</P>
      <P>The difficulty for the State is that if companies are asked to take unreasonable risks it ends up paying far too much for them to take on those risks, otherwise nobody will be interested in taking on the contract in the first place. We have to strike a balance here. There is no doubt that there is a benefit to the State, to a local authority or the NRA in having risks of delay transferred to a contractor who is better able to deal with them.</P>
      <P>During his contribution, the Minister of State mentioned the advisory groups made up of the social partners who I believe to be an important part of the process. I welcome the involvement of IBEC and ICTU in discussions over the last several years with the Government and other third parties.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that this debate, which has been going on at a high level has not percolated down. In my own dealings with the trade union movement, and indeed from some discussions that I had at our recent party conference when the issue was debated, I learned that ordinary trade union members who are working in the construction field or in some cases for local authorities are concerned at what they see as an effort to casualise them. This is something we must grasp and not allow to become a barrier. If people feel that they are going to be shifted from working for a local authority &ndash; where they are unionised and have some security of tenure and agreed conditions as well as a set negotiating procedure &ndash; to a private company with a completely different ethos and background, then it is understandable that they are going to be concerned at the very least. It is important that as part of the protocol it should be made clear that will not happen.</P>
      <P>The Minister may come back and say that the transfer of undertakings directive will come into play here but based on how I have seen the directive work I am not sure it will answer all the questions. There needs to be a high level agreement which is then explained and argued for at local level as to what exactly happens in such circumstances. The word cannot go out to workers that they are in some way being casualised or that their rights are being compromised. If it does, then this process will be stopped in its tracks and that is something we should try to avoid at all costs.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State tells me that the Bill is largely seeking to deal with the issue of <i>vires</i>. He then goes on to say &ndash; and his officials have told me this previously &ndash; that they do not think there is a <i>vires</i> problem, but just in case there is, they will plug the hole and be doubly sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, it is primarily intended to cater for joint venture companies and in that regard I have some difficulty with section 6 of the Bill. Although I understand the motivation, I think it goes further than it needs to go in the powers given to the Minister. It allows the Mini<Col N="127" /> ster to give directions to the joint venture company on a variety of issues ranging from the capital formation of the company to the payment of dividends, the creation of debt and others which include the sale of assets. I cannot see too many private companies which would be willing to engage in a joint venture company where the Minister effectively has the legal power to say how things should be done, irrespective of anything in the companies Acts or any agreement that might have been made. In our anxiety to ensure accountability we may have gone too far by giving excessive powers to the Minister in terms of the instructions he can give to such companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath was right when he said that transport, the provision of roads and the Luas and Metro systems are likely to be the most expensive areas in the next few years, aside perhaps from water and sewage. That brings up other issues, some of which are sensitive, such as tolls. My own party has taken the view that tolls are not appropriate in all circumstances and individual members of the Labour Party have been active locally in criticising tolls.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>As indeed have members of my own party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt that. I do not think hard tolls are appropriate on bypasses in circumstances where we are actively seeking people to use particular roads in order to discourage them from going through the city centre.</P>
      <P>I believe motorways are effectively inter-urban roads. For the sake of argument, people travelling from Dublin to Waterford, while they would doubtless appreciate the wonderful scenery of the Ceann Comhairle's constituency, might not actually want to leave the road at any point as their primary aim might be to get to the Minister of State's city. I am obviously failing to provoke the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>The motorway's principal purpose is to facilitate people getting from one large centre of population to another. It is, in effect, to support the economy by supporting business in the fast and efficient movement of goods and not necessarily for those who wish to scoot ten kilometres down the road to go to the pub or the supermarket or whatever. Perhaps if having a relatively modest toll has the effect of discouraging people who do have an alternative to the motorway for a ten kilometre journey, then that might not necessarily be a bad thing. In circumstances where one is actively encouraging people to use a ring road to take them out of busy city streets then we should follow the example of the French <i>autoroute</i> where the area immediately beside large urban conurbations is not tolled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill gives rise to many issues of principle but we must concentrate on the practice which must quickly lead to an improvement in our public services and infrastructure. Provided it is done <Col N="128" /> in a sensible and reasonable way I do not see there being any major opposition to that. On behalf of my party I endorse the principle behind the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The public private partnership approach is not a new one and has been used in many countries throughout Europe in one way or another and while we may be just getting to grips with it in this economy, it has great potential to deliver the type of infrastructure that we have been debating in the House for the last four years.</P>
      <P>We need such an infrastructure to ensure that our economy continues to grow and to ensure that it is delivered efficiently and quickly and to a high standard.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see a reference in the Minister of State's speech to the unit within the Department of Finance which has the overall responsibility for PPPs and how they are rolled out. There is a need to educate all those involved in State agencies about what is meant by public private partnership, what is expected from it, what can be achieved by introducing it and what plans and projects within each Department could be realised.</P>
      <P>On the one hand the public interest must be protected by ensuring projects can be delivered efficiently to the standard required by each State agency. There is an element of risk but there is nothing wrong with State agencies and others involved in PPPs taking on some risk because local authorities, health boards and so on should begin to understand the risk and responsibility involved in undertaking large projects. Risk will be part and parcel of any PPP for both private companies and State agencies. I have no doubt the private sector will provide significant expertise, which is lacking in terms of the scope of the projects to be undertaken under the national development plan and which will be required throughout the economy to ensure many of these projects are driven and delivered.</P>
      <P>I hope the framework implemented under the legislation will be flexible enough to be attractive to the private sector and will be understood by those in the public sector so that proper partnerships can be developed. Local authorities have been involved in PPPs in recent times and there has been a certain reluctance among them to take on such projects. Perhaps during the debate the concept will become more clearly understood. The legislation should outline how partnerships work, how they can deliver for local communities and State agencies and the benefits that could accrue if they function properly as part of the National Development Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in a different world economy following the events of 11 September and these are changed times for our economy in comparison to the past four years. However, that may be no harm because sometimes when there is a great deal of money available for investment in an economy by a Government, the focus shifts from value to <Col N="129" /> money, which should be part and parcel of any project that is undertaken. Sometimes projects increase in size simply because more money is available from the Government. Value for money audits should be conducted on all projects approved by local or national Government to ensure the projects are required and are not being undertaken because the money is available to do so.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the roads infrastructure is being delivered and the level of compensation being paid to do so was mentioned earlier. We could get bogged down on that issue. Many other PPP projects are ready to be undertaken by health boards, local authorities and so on such as the provision of swimming pools and the strategy for the health service, which provides investment of £10 billion over the coming years. I have no doubt if the PPP process is not speeded up and does not become more efficient, the building programme which must be undertaken to meet the requirements of the health strategy will not be delivered.</P>
    <P>Many projects have fallen behind schedule because of planning issues, the lack of availability of the necessary expertise and the lack of input by major companies, which are busy with other projects. As the Minister of State correctly pointed out, companies have been successfully attracted from France and other parts of Europe to fulfil contracts here. The delivery of water and sewerage systems has been progressed through PPP. The framework for such schemes must be absolutely clear and understood by local authorities and private sector companies. The provision of factories by IDA Ireland could also be exploited through PPP.</P>
    <P>The provision of fibre optic cable and connectivity throughout the regions has been debated in the House on numerous occasions. Such provision has failed. Telecommunications companies have laid cable but it is largely unused. The Minister for Finance should introduce a tax on such cable if it is not utilised after a certain period. This would be similar to the principle that governs derelict sites. Such a principle could be adopted in regard to use of fibre optic cable.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should be encouraged to link up with private companies in the provision of information communications technology infrastructure to ensure it is utilised. That is a major issue in terms of the economic development of the regions and it can be addressed through PPPs. Many of us are confronted by housing problems in our constituencies. The provision of housing through Respond and other voluntary agencies is done through partnership. This partnership could be used more extensively by local authorities in a more imaginative way to provide houses to eliminate waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The functions of Departments and agencies will be different in terms of how PPPs operate and evolve. I have no doubt there will be difficulties for public servants because employment will be an issue in the delivery of PPP projects. If <Col N="130" /> people have an open mind and understand the concept, they will recognise new career paths will be created within this structure that will allow them to move as options open up for them. I have no doubt it will take some time for this notion to be taken on board by officials who are used to doing their work in a set way and delivering projects in a conventional manner. PPPs will be a major change for them but they should be embraced because much could be achieved through them.</P>
    <P>Rail transport is also an example of a service that is not being delivered adequately to consumers, whether passengers or freight carriers. There are issues in terms of how the service is being delivered and financed. Perhaps local or regional authorities should be involved in a PPP to ensure Government policy on rail transport is delivered. There is also the issue of how the regions are being serviced in terms of freight and travel. The delivery of rail services and the road construction programme should be intertwined to ensure there is a joint approach to the traffic and transport problem.</P>
    <P>Public private partnerships could be broadened in how we restore our heritage sites and what we do with them. I am trying to pick out the areas where we spend a huge amount of money trying to attract tourists to the country and where sites are largely under developed. There may be people in this country or abroad who would be willing to come on board in a public private partnership either with the Department, the local authority or the local tourism organisation to develop these sites. This would compliment the tourism industry and perhaps find a function for the site. I mentioned this to the Minister by way of parliamentary question and so on and there is nothing wrong with developing such sites to benefit the public, the economy and to find either a commercial or community use for these sites. There is nothing wrong with restoring and using heritage sites in that way. Mount Juliet is a fine example of such restoration work. There are other examples throughout the country of houses being restored. This attracts people into local communities and helps to develop these heritage sites.</P>
    <P>Since I was elected to this House I have been concerned about one aspect of public private partnerships. The more we speed up the development of the economy and efficiency of the delivery of projects in order to provide greater services for the people we represent the further away we seem to push responsibility to this House. In any public private partnership, whether it is driven by a local authority or a health board, there should be some method included in the legislation which would allow us to scrutinise the activities of that authority or agency on its day to day working or involvement in a public private partnership arrangement. There is, for example, the road construction programme. If one asks a question of the NRA or any other authority in this House <Col N="131" /> one is told it is not the Minister's function. It is my function as a public representative to watch how a project is delivered. If I find fault with the project or if I need to ask a question about it, there should be a method within this House by which that question can be raised. I consider I am representing the public. At times one is a watchdog on behalf of the public, so to speak, and if one cannot raise a question in this House, people ask what use are we in that regard.</P>
    <P>I refer to the delivery of the Piltown-Fiddown bypass &ndash; other examples were given earlier. It is a fine bypass but there are questions in regard to it. When one asks the Minister to intervene and conduct an inquiry into how it was delivered, one is told it cannot be done. I do not want to see the public private partnership process in this instance, which I support, at arms' length from this House. There should be some method included in the legislation which will allow Members to ask questions on its progress, value for money and so on. That is not interfering with the process, it is complementing the process. I ask the Minister to look at how the Piltown-Fiddown bypass was delivered. There is no reason an answer cannot be delivered to this House or the Minister cannot intervene to support a motion which was carried unanimously by the local county council to ensure greater safety on that road. We are in this together. This is our country, economy, local authority and Government. We are partners within it and there should be some way of ensuring we can get answers, whether on safety, construction or how the project is delivered. Having looked at many reports of accidents on roads throughout the country, while continuing to construct roadways by way of public private partnership in the context of this Bill, road safety, the construction of the road, the safety of local communities, including the safety aspect in regard to the Piltown-Fiddown by-pass, which is 11 kilometres long and has 13 right hand turns, should be relevant. Members should be able to raise these issues on behalf of the community. There should be some structure in the House to raise these issues.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I also welcome the fact that there is a unit within the Department of Finance which can co-ordinate and move this concept forward. I hope, in the context of the health strategy and development of better local government that those involved will embrace this new concept and allow the various projects mentioned in the national development plan to be identified and delivered on in the context of public private partnership. It serves our constituents and the public well and I believe it will speed up the development of the economy in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> There should be a number of clear objectives in regard to public private partnerships. This should include the delivery of an efficient service which otherwise might not be delivered and at a cost that is appropriate to that service. The Minister of State will be aware that private enterprise will not become involved in projects unless there is money in it. The main problem with any public private partnership is to try to strike a happy medium. The project should be enhanced as a result of the involvement of private enterprise and there should be some type of State or local authority control to ensure there will not be profiteering or that standards will not be maintained.</P>
    <P>I gather from the Minister of State's speech that maintaining standards will be very important. If standards are not maintained &ndash; I will come back to this issue on the next occasion &ndash; obviously public private partnerships will be of little use. This will depend on the level of standards we set out and what we expect to get out of it. There are a whole variety of services into which the private sector could have an input. As was stated earlier, there could be public private partnerships in relation to many services which would benefit everyone concerned. However, the down turn in the world economy may create a difficulty in this regard in the next five or ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter which concerns the institute of technology in Tralee. I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of the importance of the institute to County Kerry and indeed the south-west. The college is at a very important phase of its development. It has 3,500 full-time and part-time students and 250 staff, and has an important European Union dimension with many foreign students enrolled. The college is very well placed to contribute to the future development of County Kerry, in particular with the opening of the Kerry Technology Park, which many of us worked very hard to achieve over the years, on an adjoining site and the opening of the institute's new north campus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These events augur well for the educational, industrial and technological development of the county. Unfortunately, all has not been well in the college. My understanding is that the Department appointed an inspector to investigate certain matters regarding the administration of the college and the virtual breakdown of relations between the management and staff. Despite my best efforts and numerous requests to the Department of Education and Science, no information has been forthcoming from the Minister's office regarding this report. I understand that the Mini<Col N="133" /> ster received this prior to July of this year. I am not here to play politics with the problems encountered in the institute of technology in Tralee &ndash; they are much too serious for that. We are entitled to information and answers, particularly in the public interest.</P>
    <P>There are questions the Minister must answer and they should be answered in the House tonight. Recent days have been extremely frustrating for staff and those interested in education in Kerry. The Department was poised to make a statement last Thursday, but despite persistent requests from my office and others, no statement was forthcoming. Likewise on Friday, the Department of Education and Science absolutely failed to offer clarification.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to answer these questions in the House. They are in the public interest and should be answered. Perhaps she will tell the House the status of the chairman of the board of the institute. What is the status of the director of the institute of technology? Consequent on the answers to those questions, what action does the Minister propose to take to restore confidence in the administration of the institute and to ensure that there is a constructive relationship between management, staff and students?</P>
    <P>This is a very valuable resource to the education infrastructure of the country. I do not believe we can stand by and watch what is happening. The Department has responsibilities &ndash; indeed it is probably not the responsibility of the Minister of State but rather of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods. It is long overdue that he takes action on what is happening in the college. It is important that the people of Kerry have answers and that action is taken on these matters. For too long the Department has failed to act and we now see the consequences, an administrative breakdown in the college.</P>
    <P>I am sure the acting director &ndash; as I understand appointed informally or otherwise by the Department last Friday &ndash; will have the confidence and support of all who care about third level education in County Kerry. I wish him well in his new responsibilities. He will need the full support of the Minister and the Department if he is to make progress in the current difficult circumstances. The responsibility lies with the Department of Education and Science and the sooner the information is in the public domain the better for everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Spring for raising this matter. It is an important matter for Tralee and the south-west region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 2000 the Minister for Education and Science decided to appoint an inspector to inquire into certain matters relating to the operation and management of the institute of technology in Tralee. The inspection was carried out in accordance with the provisions of section 20 of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, and <Col N="134" /> the inspector's terms of reference were to inquire into the following matters in respect of the institute of technology, Tralee: (i) the working relationship between the governing body and the director; (ii) how the respective roles of governing body, chairman of the governing body and director are being carried out and whether the manner in which the roles are carried out is consistent with effective management and operation of the institute; (iii) the implementation by the institute and the governing body of directions and guidelines on the operation of the institute, issued by the Minister or the Department, with particular regard to directions and guidelines relating to staff appointments and courses of study; (iv) any and all other matters which the inspector considers to be necessary or expedient to the carrying out of the terms of reference at paragraphs (i) to (iii) and which relate to the efficiency of instruction given in the institute or the efficient operation of the institute; and to report to him on his inquires and in that report to make such findings and recommendations as he considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>The inspector furnished his report to the Minister last March. Following detailed consideration of the inspector's report the Minister decided to establish a sworn inquiry into a number of issues arising from it. Pending the outcome of this inquiry he has suspended the director of the institute from the office of director. The chairman of the governing body has informed the Minister that he has stepped down from his position. To provide for the smooth running of the institute he has appointed the institute's registrar, Mr. Michael Carmody, as acting director of the institute in a temporary capacity pending completion of the inquiry process.</P>
    <P>The Minister is concerned that these events will not seriously prejudice the governance and operation of the institute and the welfare of its students. He has therefore asked the acting director to arrange for the convening of a meeting of the governing body of the institute at the earliest possible opportunity. I understand that a meeting of the governing body was arranged for today and that the deputy chairman or, if that office is vacant, a member of the governing body chosen by the members was to chair the meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise this issue. I have raised the future of Cork airport many times over the past four years. My interest is to ensure that the proposed extension of the airport will proceed. I had thought this had been sorted out and that plans were in place to accommodate the 2.2 million passengers projected to be travelling through the airport by 2005. The airport can currently handle one million passengers. It accommodated 1.8 million last year and it has reached and clearly exceeded its capacity. Matters are difficult for the staff and passengers, particularly at weekends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people would acknowledge that it has suffered from underinvestment and neglect. I am not being parochial, this is a very serious issue not alone for the future development of Cork but for the whole region. It is important that we recognise the value of the airport to the region. It is important for tourism but also in terms of attracting investment. It is an international airport and is a very attractive selling point to investors who wish to come in and establish industry in the Cork area. It is important that we underpin its long-term viability. I first saw plans for this three years ago but nothing came of them. I have raised the matter with the Minister for Public Enterprise on several occasions, as have other Members. Last September was the 40th anniversary of the airport and Mr. Noel Hanlon, the chief executive of the board, came to Cork and confirmed that the plan, as outlined, would go ahead. <Col N="136" /> Those plans included a terminal extension, multi-storey car park and air-bridges to facilitate passengers. Planning permission is to be sought for the development.</P>
    <P>I raise this issue because I was alarmed last week, as were many of my colleagues in the Cork area, to hear Aer Rianta state that the interim report of the interdepartmental group requested a terminal facility at Dublin Airport to accommodate low cost airlines. Aer Rianta stated that those proposals could put the proposed investment in Cork Airport at risk. That simply must not happen. I recognise the value of bringing more tourists into the country and I understand it has been a dreadful year for tourism &ndash; we all know that. We need more tourists but not at the expense of the future development of Cork Airport. That is an extremely important point. The Minister must recognise that and get a promise from Aer Rianta that any development of Dublin Airport will not affect Cork Airport. We need balanced regional development and more tourism but we must also spread the tourists around. The Cork-Kerry area is very valuable for tourism and it is important when negotiations are begun with Ryanair, Go or any other low cost airline to bring in more tourists that that is recognised.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for replying to this matter and I ask her to pass my comments on to the Minister for Public Enterprise. I know the Minister for Public Enterprise has already said today during Priority Questions that the work will go ahead</P>
    <P>I stress the future development of Cork Airport and that Cork Airport should be included in negotiations to bring more tourists into the country. We have heard Dublin and Shannon mentioned but not Cork. It is essential not only to have airport development but that we also have more air routes into the Cork region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, proposals in relation to the development of the State airports, including Cork Airport, are a matter for Aer Rianta which has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the airports and to provide such facilities and services as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers. As the Minister for Public Enterprise pointed out earlier today in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 124, Aer Rianta is committed to a major expansion programme at Cork Airport amounting to £86 million of new capital investment in infrastructure and facilities. The main features of Aer Rianta's investment programme at Cork Airport are a 25,000 square metre terminal building with associated air-bridge and hold baggage screening facilities. A multi-storey car park for 600 cars will also form part of the project. This major plan for Cork will bring the capacity of the airport up to 2.5 million passengers in 2003 and will facilitate further expansion thereafter to handle growth up <Col N="137" /> to 5 million passengers per annum in the medium to long-term.</P>
    <P>Cork Airport has seen a dramatic growth in passenger traffic in recent years, rising by 50% since 1996 to about 1.7 million passengers last year. The success in Cork Airport of driving passenger growth has continued this year with results for the first nine months showing an increase of approximately 5% over the same period last year. Obviously the success which Cork Airport has enjoyed in recent years has created new pressures on the airport's infrastructure and there is evidence of congestion building up in the system which Aer Rianta' s major development plan will address.</P>
    <P>The company informs me that its plans in relation to these major investments in Cork Airport are proceeding as planned. The Minister understands from Aer Rianta that Cork County Council has decided to grant planning permission for its development programme at Cork Airport. Subject to any appeals to An Bord Pleanala of the local authority's planning permission, Aer Rianta expects to initiate a detailed tendering process with work to commence as early as possible after completion of this process. As of now, the estimated time scale for starting the works is during spring of next year. Obviously if the planning permission granted by Cork County Council is appealed to An Bord Pleanala, there will inevitably be a delay in this time scale, possibly up to several months or even longer.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, following the dramatic downturn in the global aviation sector as a result of the terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September, the Minister requested Aer Rianta to consider initiatives to sustain and grow traffic at the three State airports. Aer Rianta responded positively to her request by offering a range of new incentives, commencing on 1 October 2001, to airlines which launch new routes into Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports. The company improved its incentive schemes at both at Cork and Shannon by increasing the period for zero airport charges for new routes from three to four years. Aer Rianta also extended this scheme to Dublin Airport where there will be no airport charges levied on airlines for new routes for a period of three years. In addition, Aer Rianta will provide marketing support for route development promotional activities.</P>
    <P>The Minister welcomes these initiatives on the part of Aer Rianta. They are intended to help reduce the impact of the current global aviation downturn on traffic at State airports, including Cork Airport, and to boost the Irish aviation and tourism sectors in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied that Aer Rianta is actively progressing its development plans to meet the growing demands at Cork Airport. The management and staff at Cork Airport are to be complimented on their hard work which has contributed so much to the prosperity of Cork and the surrounding region.</P>

      <P>I raise the important issue of the closure of the casualty department in Our Lady's Hospital, Manorhamilton, County Leitrim. It is ironic on the day after the health strategy was announced with great fanfare that the issue I must raise is not the downgrading but the closure of the casualty department of the only general hospital in County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>The staff of Our Lady's Hospital have provided an excellent service to the people of north Leitrim over many years. Many doctors, nurses and other medical staff have worked tirelessly in this department of the hospital giving professional care. I want to know who has made the decision to close the casualty unit in this hospital. Was the decision made because the Government is not willing to provide the necessary funding to the North-Western Health Board to continue this important service? The decision to close the casualty unit will put the lives of many people in the north Leitrim area at risk. It is a serious problem which should not be allowed to occur by any health board or Government. It is not good enough.</P>
      <P>Why should the people of Leitrim not receive the same service as the people in any other part of the country? This closure will have serious consequences for the health strategy being pursued by the Government. I raised this issue by way of parliamentary question on 25 October but I have not received a reply from the North-Western Health Board. The Minister's reply stated that the chief executive of the health board would investigate the position and would reply to me but, as of this date, I have not received a reply. That is not good enough. This issue is very serious and is not being treated with due urgency by the Department or the health board.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to provide the necessary funding immediately to the health board if that is what is required to reopen a fully staffed casualty department in Our Lady's Hospital, Manorhamilton, and to provide the service to the people of north Leitrim in particular they are entitled to.</P>

      <P>For many years now Our Lady's Hospital has provided a minor injuries unit for the local community. This unit never operated, however, as a full casualty or accident and emergency service as it would be understood in a modern context in such locations, for example, as the <Col N="139" /> accident and emergency departments at Sligo or Letterkenny general hospitals. The service has, therefore, effectively been confined to the provision of care for patients with minor injuries from the local community.</P>
      <P>Patients who require further intervention and treatment have been, and will continue to be, referred to the most appropriate location for care and treatment which is usually the accident and emergency department at Sligo General Hospital. In emergencies where an ambulance response is indicated, patients are transported directly to Sligo General. The North-Western Health Board is committed to continuing the provision of a minor injuries unit at the hospital. To this end, it is currently formalising protocols with the consultant in accident and emergency medicine at Sligo General Hospital which will ensure that the status of the service is fully defined.</P>
      <P>The service currently operates and will continue to operate as follows. All patients presenting are seen and assessed &ndash; triaged &ndash; in the unit by a qualified nurse on a 24 hour basis in line with practice in most accident and emergency departments. Patients requiring minor treatments are treated on site where possible. Patients who require further intervention and treatment are currently referred to Sligo General Hospital and medical back-up is available on a 24 hour on-call basis. It is anticipated that additional consultant medical staff in accident and emergency medicine will be appointed to Sligo General Hospital in 2002 which will facilitate the enhancement of the accident and emergency service at Sligo General and of the minor injuries unit at Our Lady's Hospital.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this very important issue. While I am grateful to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children for coming into the House to respond on behalf of the Minister &ndash; positively, I hope &ndash; given the seriousness of the matter, I am disappointed that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is not responding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we approach the Christmas season, thousands of people throughout the State are experiencing major inconvenience and, in many cases, real financial hardship due to the ongoing dispute at the office of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in Letterkenny, <Col N="140" /> County Donegal. Since this dispute escalated at the beginning of October, telephone and fax calls to the child benefit and treatment benefit sections at Letterkenny are not being answered. The long delay in processing child benefit is a very serious matter for people with children. A huge backlog has now built up and, even if the dispute is settled soon, it is difficult to see this backlog being cleared quickly and people receiving their due payments before Christmas. I seek assurance from the Minister on this matter and urge that every effort be made to ensure people are not deprived at this time.</P>
    <P>Treatment benefits cover financial assistance for dental and optical treatment and medical appliances. People are out of pocket and are being deprived of their just entitlements. The staff at Letterkenny, represented by the Civil and Public Services Union, have genuine grievances which must be resolved. These chiefly concern the levels of staffing and grading at the office in the context of a new computerised system. The union commenced its action at the beginning of October, a satisfactory agreement with management not having been reached. The initial action continued for four weeks and when no progress was made, it was escalated.</P>
    <P>I understand from the CPSU that initially the Department was not offering any promotions to staff officer grade and has now offered four. This would still leave the ratio of staff officers to clerical officers in Letterkenny far below the ratio in the Department generally which is one to five. The union believes that these promotions are necessary in the context of the introduction of the new computerised system.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Department's failure to establish a partnership committee at Letterkenny is central to the industrial relations problems there. There is a clear obligation on management, under successive partnership agreements, to establish such a committee. It is unacceptable that such a dispute should have been allowed to develop and fester in such a key Department. The widespread effects of the dispute have been highlighted by the Dóchas for Women organisation in my home county of Monaghan. The organisation works with women on a daily basis, a number of whom have been deprived of payments due to them. Some mothers of babies born up to four months ago still have not received payments.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to ensure that the staffing and grading issues at the heart of the dispute are resolved immediately and that the necessary partnership committee is established at the Letterkenny office. The Minister has a special responsibility, I contend, to ensure families are not left seriously out of pocket in the approach to Christmas. Go raibh maith agat.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> The CPSU, which represents the grades of clerical officer and staff officer, has been taking industrial action in the Letterkenny decentralised office of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs since Tuesday, 2 October. This office administers the child benefit and treatment benefit schemes.</P>
    <P>The industrial action started with a total ban on working overtime and on dealing with telephone and fax inquiries. Since Tuesday, 30 October, the action has been extended to include the withdrawal of co-operation with the implementation of a new computer system for the delivery of child benefit, together with a ban on a range of administrative tasks such as photocopying and the making of work returns. While the industrial action is preventing the Department's customers from contacting the Letterkenny office by telephone or fax, claims continue to be received in the post and these are being processed. The position in relation to the clearance of claims is, on the whole, satisfactory with no more on hand than is normal for this time of year.</P>
    <P>The Minister would make the point, however, that a seasonal peak occurs at this time every year in relation to children over 16 years of age returning to school after the summer. Some delay is normal in relation to child benefit claims in this category but in these cases also, good progress is being made on clearing the claim loads. The level of arrears currently on hand in respect of both child and treatment benefit claims is broadly in line with the position that pertains in normal circumstances at this time of the year. The Minister regrets the inconvenience to the public arising as a result of the industrial action and would like me to emphasise that every effort is being made to resolve the dispute within the context of existing industrial relations agreements.</P>
    <P>As part of the programme of modernisation of the systems for delivering social welfare services, the Department is currently engaged in the development and implementation of a new computer system for the child benefit scheme, known as the service delivery model. In the context of this project, it emerged in August last that there was a temporary need for eight staff at clerical officer level for a period of six months. The recruitment of temporary staff is provided for under the restructuring agreement for grades represented by the CPSU, negotiated centrally under the PCW. This agreement also commits the union to a range of flexibilities and co-operation with organisational change, new schemes and initiatives and technology.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of temporary staff was first broached by local management of the Department with the Letterkenny branch of the CPSU and then, at the request of CPSU head office, consultations took place between the head office and the Department's personnel area. In line with normal practice, these central consultations covered the reasons temporary staff were needed, their numbers, the likely duration of employment <Col N="142" /> and the proposed approach for sourcing staff for the eight temporary posts. The union was also advised that the Department, being sensitive to the infrequent opportunities for transfers to Letterkenny under the central transfer system, intended to fill five of the eight temporary posts by permanent assignments from the central transfer list. This was done on the basis that these posts would be absorbed, over time, into the normal staffing figure for the Letterkenny office. Following on these consultations, the recruitment of the three temporary staff was agreed by CPSU headquarters.</P>
    <P>The union subsequently maintained that adequate consultation had not taken place in relation to the recruitment of the three temporary staff. It then indicated that the remedy being sought was the assignment of a further three permanent clerical officers to Letterkenny. This was not accepted by the Department as there was no business need for the assignment of additional staff. The Department is quite satisfied that it fully complied with the provisions of the restructuring agreement as set out in general council report No. 1323 relating to the recruitment of temporary staff.</P>
    <P>This agreement specifically allows for the employment of temporary staff on contracts not exceeding 12 months, even where there is a dispute between a Department and the union as to whether temporary staff are warranted. In circumstances where such a dispute arises, the agreement provides for the issue to be referred to a monitoring group with the assistance of a facilitator, if necessary. The Department proposed to the CPSU on several occasions that this mechanism be used to resolve the dispute. However, the union's position, as communicated to the Department, is that this would be time wasting and diversionary.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the industrial action was balloted on in relation to the issue of consultation in respect of the employment of three temporary staff, it has since been represented by the CPSU that the action is in response to a failure by the Department adequately to consult on the implementation of the new computer system for child benefit. Having taken this position the union then stated that its co-operation with the implementation of the new computer system is conditional on a substantial package of promotions and additional staffing for the decentralised office of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in Letterkenny. It also made known that as the new system was developed over time to cater for other schemes administered in the Department's decentralised offices in Sligo and Longford and in headquarters offices in Dublin, its co-operation was similarly dependent on further substantial packages of promotions for its members in each of these locations.</P>
    <P>In response to these demands the Department proposed that the union avail of a mechanism in the restructuring agreement which provides that where the union considers there are significant <Col N="143" /> implications for the career opportunities for its membes, the Departmenrt would discuss the matter with it, with the involvement of a facilitator at the request of either side.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's five minutes have concluded. However, if the House is agreeable, she may continue. It is most unreasonable for Ministers to prepare speeches of nine or ten pages for a five minute slot. It is also very unfair to the staff of the House to prolong the House at this hour of the night, any longer than is required by Standing Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I will raise the matter with the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>The facilitator would assist in assessing the concerns of the union and, in the light of that assessment, arrive at means by which any valid concerns should be addressed. However, the union has refused to go this route and, instead, is insisting that an offer of a substantial package of promotions and additional staffing in the Letterkenny office must be made by the Department to bring about a cessation of the industrial action. In taking this approach the union is effectively divesting itself of all obligations to deliver on the flexibilities and co-operation with change for which its members have already been paid. At the same time it is also disregarding the available dispute resolution mechanisms which it negotiated with the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs cannot meet demands such as those now being made by the CPSU. To do so would have the effect of negating agreements already in place, thereby introducing a system whereby changes designed to deliver improved services to our customers would have to be negotiated and paid for on an item by item basis. It would be impossible for the Department, which has over 2,600 staff in grades represented by the CPSU, in about 200 offices across the country, to manage improved service delivery and indusrial relations on such an uncertain and confrontational basis. Inevitably, such a scenario could <Col N="144" /> lead to disputes throughout the organisation as it became clear to CPSU members that additional benefits could be obtained under threat of industrial action. This could well have similar implications for improvements in service delivery throughout the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>In the context of the dispute, reference has been made to the fact that a local partnership committee has yet to be established in the Department's decentralised office in Letterkenny. The delay in establishment of the committee has arisen because the CPSU has attempted to exercise a veto on the involvement in the committee of staff in grades represented by the union who are not members of the CPSU. The Department maintains that this position is not in keeping with the agreement governing the establishment of partnership committees. Nonetheless, it has indicated that, in line with the phased establishment of other partnership committees, a committee consisting of management and unions could be established in the first instance. The issue of a union veto is a matter to be addressed in the Civil Service-wide review of the partnership process.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to say that every effort is being made by the Department to bring about a resolution of the dispute. Whatever resolution emerges, however, cannot be based on unilateral demands by the CPSU for a package of promotions. Any such package must be based on the business needs of the Department or, alternatively, arrived at following discussions with the union on the implications of the new child benefit computer system for the career opportunities of its members in Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>In this context, the most recent meeting between officials of the Department and the union took place last week on 20 November. There have been ongoing contacts with the union since with a view to putting together a draft agreement aimed at bringing about a resolution of the dispute. Further contacts are expected to take place in the coming days, which, I hope, will result in the cessation of the industrial action.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 28 November 2001.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>if she will meet Iarnród Éireann to discuss the possibility of an order to set a maximum number of passengers to be carried on carriages on Iarnród Éireann trains; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[29749/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The imposition of a limit on the number of passengers to be carried on carriages on Iarnród Éireann's trains would be an operational matter for the company. Iarnród Éireann has a statutory responsibility for ensuring the safety of its passengers. It is therefore a matter for the company to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.</P>
      <P>There has been continuing growth in passenger numbers in the past few years and this has resulted in heavy loading at peak periods, in particular on the weekday DART and suburban services and on the weekend inter-city services. I am aware of the discomfort that passengers have experienced as a result of this. To address the current difficulties, the Government is committed to providing additional capacity on the railway network. Significant funding has been and continues to be made available to Iarnród Éireann for investment to improve the safety of the network, increase the physical capacity of the system and improve the quality, reliability and speed of services.</P>
      <P>In 2000, ten new DART cars were brought into service and an additional 16 DART cars have already entered service this year. A further 12 DART cars have recently been delivered and will go into service early next year. These increases in rolling stock on the DART line will increase passenger capacity from 14,000 when DART services were launched in 1984 to almost 21,000, an increase of 50%.</P>
      <P>In relation to the suburban network, 20 diesel rail cars were delivered in 2000 for use on the upgraded Maynooth line. These new railcars have increased the capacity of the Maynooth line by 100% at peak times. A further 80 diesel railcars are on order for delivery in 2002-03. The first of these is due for delivery in June 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the national development plan provides for the acquisition by Iarnród Éireann of 20 new mainline rail carriages. I understand Iarnród Éireann is evaluating proposals in that <Col N="146" /> regard but that the board has not yet taken a decision in the matter and no formal proposals have been submitted to my Department.</P>
    <P>The ongoing delivery of the new rolling stock will substantially increase the available capacity to deal with peak periods and should help to alleviate the present crowding difficulties. I have advised the House previously that there are no safety standards in place in relation to overcrowding of trains either in this country or at EU level. However, the railway inspecting officers of my Department have been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions drawing their attention to the importance of constantly reviewing the matter of crowding of trains.</P>
    <P>In February 2001, an independent review of Iarnród Éireann's strategy for controlling crowding on commuter trains in the Dublin area was completed. The report, commissioned by Iarnród Éireann, concluded that Iarnród Éireann had implemented a number of important measures to control crowding on its commuter services but also identified additional options which they recommended for further evaluation by Iarnród Éireann. I am awaiting the result of Iarnród Éireann's evaluation of these options.</P>
    <P>However, the report did not address all the issues that the railway inspectorate of my Department had anticipated, specifically safety management on the inter-city trains. The chief railway inspecting officer of my Department has informed Iarnród Éireann that this matter will have to be dealt with appropriately in a safety case which will be required of Iarnród Éireann under the forthcoming railway safety legislation. In this context, the chief railway inspecting officer has indicated to the company that he would like this element of the safety case to be dealt with as a matter of priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 47 and 133 together.</P>
      <P>As regards the circumstances surrounding the incident at Dublin Airport raised by Deputy Higgins, I refer the Deputy to my reply to the Adjournment Debate of 4 October 2001 on this issue, in which I confirmed that I was shown the multi-purpose implement involved by the journalist concerned. My Department has been keeping in touch with Aer Rianta in relation to the ongoing investigation of this incident. I understand that Aer Rianta has consulted its legal advisers with a view to securing all necessary information to facilitate the completion of a thorough investigation of all of the circumstances.     </P>
      <P>In so far as national aviation security generally is concerned, the standing National Civil Aviation Security Committee &ndash; NCASC &ndash; chaired by a senior official from my Department has convened nine special meetings to date, the first of which took place on the day following the terrorist attacks in the US. I have been advised that the NCASC has been reviewing aviation security procedures in the light of the current security situation, made arrangements for the implementation of new aviation security measures and continues to examine specific security proposals with a view to safeguarding Irish aviation and increasing the effectiveness of existing practices and procedures.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the NCASC is to advise the Government and the civil aviation industry of security policy for civil aviation, to recommend and review the effectiveness of security measures and to provide for co-ordination of the various interests involved. The committee comprises representatives of Departments, Aer Rianta, airlines, the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, An Post, Customs and Excise, Irish Aviation Authority, the Irish Airline Pilots' Association and the regional airports.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice on security grounds to disclose details of any security measures that have been or will be put in place at airports or in relation to airlines but I assure Deputies that appropriate measures are being taken to safeguard civil aviation in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>A draft directive amending Directive 97/67EC with regard to the further opening to competition of community postal services is under discussion at the European Parliament. The main measures which have yet to be ratified by the European Parliament, are: a reduction of <Col N="148" /> the weight and price limits in the reserved area to 100 grams in 2003 and 50 grams in 2006 with corresponding price limits of three and two and a half times the standard tariff; outgoing cross-border mail may continue to be reserved within the same weight and price limits to the extent necessary to ensure the provision of universal services; a study is to be completed by the European Commission on the impact of full liberalisation on the universal service in all member states, leading to a report to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers by the end of 2006; and a proposal confirming, if appropriate, the date of 2009 for full liberalisation of the market or determining any other step in the light of the study's conclusions.</P>
      <P>There is no firm date as yet for these matters to return to the Council after consideration by the European Parliament. These measures have no implications for the provision of postal services in rural areas. An Post, as the designated universal service provider, will continue to be obliged to provide a nationwide service at a common tariff. Clearly, further liberalisation of the letter post market will have an impact on An Post's core business. However, it will also present opportunities. I am confident that An Post, which in terms of price and the quality of the service it provides remains competitively positioned in the European Union, will meet the challenge of an increasingly liberalised market.</P>

      <P>A settlement was reached on 24 October 2001 in the High Court case taken by Nestor Bus Limited against CIE, Bus Éireann, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Ireland and the Attorney General. Under the terms of the settlement, the case against CIE and Bus Éireann was dismissed and costs awarded against the plaintiff. The case against the State was struck out with an order for the plaintiff's costs to be recovered from the State.</P>
      <P>The issues arising from the recent High Court case are being taken into consideration in the regulatory reform programme which my Department has already embarked on. The main conclusion arising from the case is that it confirms the Road Transport Act, 1932, is out of date and must be replaced with a modern regulatory framework which will meet the needs of the travelling public. The issue of revising the Department's policy guidelines on bus licensing is also being urgently examined in the light of this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has already made significant progress on the regulation reform process. Two Government consultation papers have been pub<Col N="149" /> lished setting out proposals for institutional and regulatory reform of public transport, with a particular emphasis on bus services in the greater Dublin area and on independent regulation of public transport. Consultations with the Public Transport Partnership Forum on these reform proposals are nearing completion. A consultancy study is currently under way in relation to proposed bus regulatory reform outside of the greater Dublin area. The consultants are expected to report early in the new year and I hope to publish a further Government consultation paper following consideration of the consultant's recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 42 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The task force on Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensions established by the chairmen of the companies concerned at my request to examine concerns about the Irish airlines &ndash; general employees &ndash; superannuation scheme completed their work and submitted a report to the chairmen of the companies at the end of May 2000.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the question of pension increases, I understand that the rules of the Irish airlines scheme do not provide for pension increases in line with pay movements. However, I have been advised that in line with the discretion available to them under the scheme, the trustees have provided pension increases in line with the consumer price index. The benefits from the scheme are those that have been agreed by the membership of the scheme and are matters for the trustees having regard to the rules of the scheme. I have no function in relation to such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised that neither Aer Lingus nor Aer Rianta are in a position to provide additional annual payments into the pension fund to meet the claim by the retirees association. I <Col N="150" /> understand that both companies have been meeting all of their liabilities towards the pension fund in accordance with the rules of the scheme. In so far as policy concerning pension increases of State companies is concerned, I understand from the Department of Finance that there is no general policy which imposes an obligation on State bodies to provide pension increases in line with the public service pay system, that is, in line with the pay increases of serving staff. There has not been any change in this policy.</P>
    <P>As regards pension enhancements to benefit both serving staff and existing pensioners going forward, I have been advised that Aer Lingus had initiated discussions earlier this year with employee representatives on the terms of a new pension scheme in the context of the privatisation of the airline. I know those discussions are not now being progressed because of the extra costs involved for the company which would not be sustainable in present circumstances given the current financial crisis in the airline.</P>
    <P>As far as Aer Rianta is concerned, the company, in consultation with staff interests, proposes to establish its own pension scheme with the same benefits as in the existing Irish airlines scheme. Any enhancements to benefits from the proposed pension scheme would be contemplated only in the context of the implementation of a programme of strategic change in that company. As Deputies will be aware, I committed the case made by the Retired Aviation Staff Association for enhanced pension increases for Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensioners to my colleague, the Minister for Finance who has overall responsibility for pensions in the public sector. I recently received a reply from him, the contents of which have been communicated to the retirees' association.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance does not consider that it would be appropriate to accede to the request from the retired aviation staff association for an Exchequer injection and that there must be adherence to the long standing policy in this area, namely, that pension entitlements for employees of commercial State Bodies which includes Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta are a matter for the trustees, the members of the relevant pension scheme and the companies involved.</P>

The main measures which have yet to be ratified by the European Parliament, are: a reduction of the weight and price limits in the reserved area to 100 grams in 2003 and 50 grams in 2006 with corresponding price limits of three and two and a half times the standard tariff; outgoing cross-border mail may continue to be reserved within the same weight and price limits to the extent necessary to ensure the provision of universal services; a study is to be completed by the European Commission on the impact of full liberalisation on the universal service in all member states, leading to a report to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers by the end of 2006; and a proposal confirming, if appropriate, the date of 2009 for full liberalisation of the market or determining any other step in the light of the study's conclusions.</P>
      <P>There is no firm date as yet for these matters to return to the Council after consideration by the European Parliament. These measures have no implications for the provision of postal services in rural areas. An Post, as the designated universal service provider, will continue to be obliged to provide a nationwide service at a common tariff. Clearly, further liberalisation of the letter post market will have an impact on An Post's core business. However, it will also present opportunities. I am confident that An Post, which in terms of price and the quality of the service it provides remains competitively positioned in the European Union, will meet the challenge of an increasingly liberalised market.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response to Dáil Question No. 40 on 17 October 2001. Arranging for the establishment of a national facility for the long-term safe storage of low level radioactive waste is a complex and protracted project which requires detailed and careful consideration. While a number of sites have been short-listed as possible locations, site evaluation visits to establish if these sites meet the needs of a secure waste facility have yet to be arranged. It is premature to publish the working list of prospective sites until these evaluations have been completed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, an exercise to test the National Emergency Plan took place on 10 November 2001. The consultants, engaged by my Department to manage the test, have advised that they will report on the outcome of the test around mid-December.</P>

I expect that the distribution of both these documents will take place early in the new year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, and recognising that there is a public need for information on countermeasures in the event of a nuclear accident, my Department placed an advertisement in the National and provincial press during the week beginning 11 November.

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 74 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware from replies which I have given to previous Dáil questions, that I have not adopted any particular ideological position on the concept of privately owned terminal facilities at Dublin Airport. There are a number of complex considerations both for and against that concept. Generally speaking, a competing second terminal has not been shown to be a viable proven concept elsewhere, but I stress again that I maintain an open mind on the matter.</P>
      <P>There has been renewed interest recently in this concept as a result of the terrorist incidents in the US on 11 September and the direct impact of those incidents on the aviation and tourism sectors.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, an interdepartmental group was established recently under the aegis of the Taoiseach's Department with a view to identifying possibilities for encouraging and generating additional travel by air, increasing the flow of tourists to Ireland and countering the adverse affects of the terrorist incidents in the US. The group includes representatives of my Department, the Department of Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Attorney General's office.</P>
      <P>As one might expect the group has been looking, <i>inter alia</i>, at the role and contribution of aviation policy, including airports, in countering the adverse effects of 11 September and boosting the flow of visitors to Ireland. The group has been looking among other things at the expanded incentive scheme for landing charges recently announced by Aer Rianta. It is also looking in a short-term context at the question of designating or constructing a specific low-cost facility within the existing terminal complex at Dublin Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interdepartmental group has recently produced an interim report, a copy of which was forwarded to me by the Taoiseach. The report incorporates suggestions for a range of possible measures to be implemented by Aer Rianta with a view to meeting the objectives of facilitating the maximum number of visitors to Ireland and ensuring that Irish airports are cost competitive and have appropriate infrastructure to meet the current and prospective needs of the airline industry. This includes the following elements: to develop a more aggressive drive to encourage growth in passenger numbers through pricing and market support strategies &ndash; this would include encouraging growth from current levels of existing routes; to procure the development of pier D by spring 2003 on the basis of existing planning permission as a low-cost facility targeting low-cost operators; to enter into appropriate arrangements for the management of pier D to ensure that it facilitates significant growth in throughput at Dublin Airport from low-cost operators; to manage the allocation of existing facilities in the <Col N="155" /> interim to encourage growth in traffic by low cost carriers through appropriate capacity allocation plans at Dublin Airport; and to develop appropriate strategies to increase traffic through Shannon and Cork with a view to implementation by next year's tourism season.</P>
    <P>The next step suggested in the interim report is for Aer Rianta to respond with an implementation strategy which takes account of the proposals in the report. In view of the serious effects on aviation and tourism of the recent events in the US, the Government attaches a great deal of importance to moving forward as quickly as possible with a positive and constructive approach to the elements of the strategy outlined in the interim report. In view of this, I have asked Aer Rianta to respond as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I should make clear to the House that the statutory mandate under which Aer Rianta is required to operate includes the requirement to operate on a fully commercial basis. I should also make clear the firm view that any new measures or facilities applicable to air carriers, developed as a means of promoting air travel and tourism, must be made available on a non-discriminatory basis to all airlines who seek to avail of such measures or facilities. The present position is that the Aer Rianta response is awaited.</P>
    <P>The question of a fully fledged separate terminal competing with the Aer Rianta terminal at Dublin Airport has to be seen in a medium to longer-term context. This is more a complex concept and is likely to require the assistance of outside expertise, particularly in the economic and technical fields. Clearly, if such a concept were deemed to be feasible, it would involve several years from evaluation and definition of the concept through to design, planning and realisation.</P>
    <P>I trust that the foregoing fully clarifies the current position for the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 54, 84 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>Since taking office in 1997, I have vigorously pursued the Government's campaign against Sellafield. I have had numerous meetings with UK Ministers and been in regular correspondence with them to convey, in the strongest possible terms, the Government's total opposition to the Sellafield operations, including the MOX plant. I have raised the profile of the Government's anti-nuclear policy at every available opportunity on the international front such as at the EU, at the International Energy Agency, at the OSPAR Commission and at the United Nations in New York. I have also developed links with like-minded countries, in particular with a number of the nordic countries who have similar concerns about radioactive discharges from the Sellafield reprocessing plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> Despite these efforts, the Sellafield plant continues in operation. However, there have been a number of positive developments, notably the adoption in 1998 by the contracting parties to the OSPAR Convention of a Strategy on Radioactive Substances. This strategy commits the contracting parties to the convention, which include the UK, to the virtual elimination of radioactive discharges to the marine environment by the year 2020. Ireland was very much to the fore in the development of this strategy at OSPAR. Its adoption by the OSPAR Ministers was a vindication of Ireland's efforts throughout the OSPAR process. The adoption of the strategy was also a recognition of the concerns raised by Ireland and a number of other countries about the impact of radioactive discharges from nuclear reprocessing plants on public health and the environment.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue its battle against the Sellafield plant and to strongly resist any expansion of the operations at the plant.</P>
    <P>With specific regard to the Sellafield MOX plant, I would refer the Deputies to my response to a number of recent Dáil Questions, in particular Dáil Questions Nos. 41 and 52 of 17 October and Dáil Question No. 198 of 13 November. In my response to those questions, I outlined the Government's contacts with the British Government since the latter's decision to give the go ahead to the plant and also the legal action under both the OSPAR Convention and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which the Government has embarked upon against the UK.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that pending a full hearing of Ireland's case under UNCLOS which should be heard next year, Ireland requested the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea to order legally binding interim measures which would have the effect of an injunction on the UK to stop the commissioning of the MOX plant and associated shipments of nuclear materials. This request was heard by the tribunal last week and the outcome of the hearing will be known on 3 December.</P>
    <P>The legal action under the OSPAR Convention which is aimed at procuring detailed economic information about the Mox plant is proceeding on schedule. A preparatory meeting which will involve the OSPAR Tribunal's arbitrators will take place next month and a full hearing will take place next year.</P>
    <P>The Government is also finalising consideration of possible legal action against the UK under EU law in regard to the MOX plant. As consideration of legal action on this front is not yet complete, I cannot comment, at this stage, on the nature of any such action.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 66 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>There were two unrelated incidents on the same stretch of track in County Wicklow earlier this month, the first on 8 November and the second on 12 November.</P>
      <P>On 8 November two locomotives rolled away from Arklow station, entered the Arklow to Rathdrum single line section without authority and crew and on meeting an incline came to a halt approximately 3 miles on the Dublin side of Arklow.</P>
      <P>A railway inspecting officer of my Department visited the scene the following morning. The preliminary information available from Iarnród Éireann and from the railway inspecting officer would seem to indicate that the incident gave rise to an unsafe situation which, had safety procedures not been activated, could have resulted in a serious accident.</P>
      <P>The chief railway inspecting officer has requested further information on this incident from Iarnród Éireann, including in regard to technical and procedural issues. I have asked Iarnród Éireann to complete its internal inquiry into this incident as a matter of urgency and to provide a copy of its findings to the chief railway inspecting officer. I have also asked Iarnród Éireann to provide an interim report as a matter of urgency, indicating the preliminary findings of its inquiry and indicating the immediate actions, if any, to be taken to prevent similar occurrences on the railway network in the future. I expect to receive this interim report towards the end of December.</P>
      <P>On 12 November, a maintenance train struck and broke a high-tension ESB power cable which appears to have been lying across the tracks a short distance beyond Shelton, damaging track circuit relays and some vehicles in the vicinity. I understand that following repairs the line returned to normal service on 14 November.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann will shortly begin an inquiry into this incident and I have asked that a report of its findings be submitted to the chief railway inspecting officer as soon as its investigation is concluded.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann have advised me that this line is being operated to a safe standard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The total value of expenditure to date on the digital media district project, now known as the Digital Hub, amounts to £43.5 million, 55.2 million.</P>
      <P>This is broken down between capital expenditure of £41.3 million, 52.4 million, which was for the purchase of property for the hub, and current expenditure of £2.2 million, 2.7 million, the bulk of which was for operating expenses of Digital Media Development Ltd., the company set up to oversee the development of the hub.</P>
      <P>In addition, there has been capital expenditure of £15 million, 19 million for the Media Lab Europe project in line with its establishment agreement, and current expenditure of £1million, 1.27 million for collaborative research between Media Lab Europe and Irish universities.</P>
      <P>The board of Digital Media Development Ltd. (DMDL), which was appointed by the Taoiseach in April 2000, comprises: Paddy Teahon (chairperson), Paul Kavanagh, Dan Flinter, Peter Cassells, Jackie Harrison, John Fitzgerald, Don Thornhill and Paul McGuinness.</P>
      <P>In addition to approving funds for property purchase and operational expenses for the project, the Government, in its decision of April 2001, also directed that a development plan be prepared by the board of DMDL.</P>
      <P>The DMDL development plan for the hub is almost complete and, subject to approval by the Government liaison committee which monitors the project, is expected to be launched by DMDL in December. It will include, <i>inter alia,</i> proposals for the development of the properties including private sector investment and, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, a strategy to attract digital content enterprises to the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Shannon Airport has experienced extremely good growth in passenger throughput in recent years. Over the past two years, 1999 and 2000, traffic through Shannon Airport increased by in excess of 0.5 million passengers representing growth of more than 30% on 1998 levels. Passenger traffic for the first nine months of this year reached almost 2 million.</P>
      <P>The dreadful events in the US in September are having a dramatic impact on the aviation sector throughout the world and particularly on travel to and from the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> I greatly regret the reduction in services across the Aer Lingus network and capacity cutbacks by other carriers operating in Ireland which have an impact on all three State airports, including Shannon Airport. As the Deputy will be aware, Aer Lingus terminated its transatlantic services to Newark and Baltimore and reduced services to Boston, Los Angeles and Chicago. The Delta daily service to JFK has also been terminated, at least for the winter. Some other services from Shannon on domestic, UK and European routes have also been terminated or curtailed as a result of the current downturn in the global aviation market.</P>
    <P>I would expect that when confidence in air travel, particularly in the US, is re-established and the aviation market recovers generally, the strong growth curve at Shannon Airport will resume. In this regard the adoption of the survival plan for Aer Lingus is vital to secure the position of the company and will provide a strong base for sustainable future growth when the market recovers.</P>
    <P>In this regard also, I very much welcome the announcement last month by Aer Rianta to extend its zero charges incentive scheme for airlines which launch new routes into the three State airports. In the case of new routes at Shannon, Aer Rianta extended the period for zero airport charges from three to four years and the company will also provide marketing support for the promotion of new routes.</P>
    <P>I emphasise, as I have done on numerous previous occasions, that Government policy on transatlantic services at Shannon Airport remains unchanged. The Government recently confirmed the continuation of the policy in relation to transatlantic services at Shannon in the context of its consideration of the difficult situation in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to maintaining a viable Shannon Airport as well as a viable Aer Lingus. I am confident that, despite the current difficulties in the aviation sector, the future viability of Shannon Airport is secure and it will continue to grow and prosper, continuing its valuable contribution to balanced regional development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in previous replies to parliamentary questions on this topic, the Government remains firmly committed to an anti-nuclear policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> Ireland retains the right to determine the fuel used in any generating station that is established in Ireland. The position under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, introduced by me, is that nuclear power cannot be used for the production of electricity in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the EU Electricity Directive 96/92/EC relating to third party access to networks, eligible customers are entitled, if the necessary interconnection capacity exists, to contract directly with generators or other suppliers abroad for electricity. Up to now, Ireland's only interconnection has been with Northern Ireland, which does not have nuclear power.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Moyle interconnector between Northern Ireland and Scotland is expected to commence operation in early 2002. This means that electricity may be imported over that interconnector into the Northern Irish grid and then into the grid in the Republic. It should be noted that in the UK, as elsewhere, electricity is generated from a variety of sources and once electricity enters the grid it is not possible to identify its fuel source.</P>
    <P>It seems reasonable to expect that the known position of the Government, and I believe of all the major political parties, as well as clear public opinion would strongly discourage eligible customers from knowingly contracting for electricity imports clearly traceable to nuclear stations.</P>

      <P>Following independent consultancy advice on the procurement arrangements for an integrated ticketing system for the greater Dublin area, my Department in early 2001 requested the LRPO to develop an integrated ticketing project.</P>
      <P>In August 2001, an outline project plan was agreed with the light rail project office which is proceeding with the work in that regard. The project plan is taking the project from design to launch incorporating procurement, installation, commissioning and rollout.</P>
      <P>Consistent with this development, Dublin Bus, Iarnród Éireann and the Luas project are in the process of acquiring new ticket vending machines which will allow for the use of SMART Card technology and greater ticket integration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the more immediate term, as part of its programme for developing a more technological approach to ticket vending, Dublin Bus has recently launched an on-line service for the pur<Col N="163" /> chase of bus tickets on all its routes. Bus Éireann will launch a similar service shortly.</P>
    <P>An integrated ticketing system is operated on the AerDart service linking Dublin Airport by bus to the DART system. In addition, Dublin Bus and Iarnród Éireann will shortly launch integrated tickets for use on both Dublin Bus and DART services.</P>

My Department and the Department of Finance are currently discussing with Aer Lingus the process for implementing the Government decision in relation to private investment. A formal announcement will be made once the process and timetable has been agreed.

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government recognises the importance of telecommunications and digital industries to the economic development of the country and is committed to the development of a high quality communications and information technology sector and an environment that will further facilitate e-business and ICT industries. The Government's means for the development of the sector lies through the promotion and fostering of sustainable competition within a fair and transparent regulatory framework. In a fully liberalised market, the provision of communications infrastructure is principally the role of the private sector.</P>
      <P>However, there are instances where it transpires that the market will not provide the investment in advanced communications infrastructure and services in particular regions. In order that rural and regional areas may be in a position to attract and promote further investment in the ICT sector, I have in recent years put in place a number of initiatives under national policy, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly by bringing broadband connectivity to regional and rural areas. Under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, 26 million &ndash; £20 million &ndash; was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled-out broadband nationwide were supported and are now nearing completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, 200 million has been allocated to promote and co-fund the roll-out of advanced communications networks, which will act as enabling pieces of infrastructure, in rural and underdeveloped areas of the country. Nine contracts worth 56 million &ndash; £44 million &ndash; were signed with five companies in early 2001, following a competitive tender process and these projects will result in a total investment of about 170 million &ndash; £134 million &ndash; in advanced ICT infrastructure. A second call for proposals was issued in July of this year with the aim of further developing broadband communications infrastructure and <Col N="166" /> services to enable the uptake of the information society in the BMW and south and east regions.</P>
    <P>Organisations were invited to submit tenders under one of three programmes: commercial broadband roll-out projects, commercial DSL roll-out projects to areas prioritised in conjunction with Forfás, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and public projects with economic development and social objectives for which public bodies were eligible to tender. As a result of this second call, 31 proposals have been received. Twenty of these proposals are applications made by local authorities-public bodies. The other 11 are proposals from private sector companies. Although SMEs were not specifically targeted under the call for proposals, local authorities and communications companies were encouraged to discuss and consult with all local businesses and organisations before making a project proposal in order to ascertain their communications requirements.</P>
    <P>My Department also announced a call for proposals for pilot trials of VSAT, very small aperture terminals &ndash; satellite terminals &ndash; to deliver broadband access in a number of diverse user communities around the country, which closed at the end of August 2000. The aims of the pilot project were to test the deployment of VSAT technology as a means for providing broadband access to serve diverse types of users, for example, educational establishments, the agriculture sector, SMEs and Gaeltacht regions, etc., and to assess the feasibility of providing broadband infrastructure to remote communities using VSAT technology. Contracts were signed with three organisations. With the assistance of grants awarded by the DPE these three groups are working to install and maintain 87 VSAT terminals to provide high-speed Internet access to schools, libraries, small businesses and community centres throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>In an additional initiative, a study was undertaken on behalf of my Department to consider options on addressing certain communications infrastructure gaps throughout the country and to promote competition and reduce the price of broadband services to business and residential users in the west of Ireland. On foot of this study, I sought expressions of interest in designing, building, operating and managing a seamless, world class, high speed telecommunications network linking north-west to south-west Ireland, with interconnectivity to existing national networks. The deadline for receipt of these expressions of interest in an Atlantic broadband corridor was the 31 October 2001. My officials are currently evaluating the expressions of interest received.</P>

      <P>Under the national development plan, all buses purchased by both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann for use on urban services have been low floor and wheelchair accessible. In pursuing this policy Bus Átha Cliath expects to have over 300 low floor wheelchair accessible buses operating in Dublin city by the end of this year. This will represent almost 30% of the fleet and over the period of the national development plan, the company hopes to reach a low-floor target of 60% for its fleet. A total of 19 bus routes now have fully accessible services. These include services to the following areas: Ballymun, Ranelagh, Tallaght, Rathmines, Clondalkin, the airport, Heuston Station, Malahide, Portmarnock, the docklands, Marino, Crumlin and Walkinstown. I understand that two more routes will be fully converted to low floor bus operation by the end of this year and that further route conversions are planned.</P>
      <P>With regard to Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford it is expected that Bus Éireann's services in those cities will be 100% wheelchair accessible by the end of this year. Also, following a successful trial involving the provision of commuter services on the Dublin-Ashbourne route using double deck low floor buses, Bus Éireann has placed an order for a further six such buses for delivery by end 2001. In addition, the company has currently on trial some 20 low floor wheelchair accessible buses on rural services. The results of these trials will be used as a basis for determining future purchases.</P>

      <P>The situation in relation to CIE fares is that direct conversion to euro can result in inconvenient fares that are impractical to operate. The Government's position on the euro changeover is that the public sector should favour the citizen where convenient euro amounts are judged necessary. In the circumstances CIE is being requested, where exact conversion is not desirable, to round down its fares on conversion into euro.</P>

      <P>The forum, which is representative of An Post, the Irish Postmaster's Union and relevant Departments and which is chaired by Phil Flynn, was established to identify and recommend measures to progress the implementation of necessary changes to the post office network in the light of the substantial losses of up to 102 million &ndash; £80 million &ndash; being forecast for the network by 2004. The forum has met four times and is making good progress on a range of issues central to the restructuring process. These include: the introduction of agency arrangements for 26 post offices on a pilot basis; the agreement of a suitable package for postmasters who wish to surrender their contracts to provide network services; and an examination of what additional Government and other services could be routed through the post office network.</P>
      <P>The increase in pay for postmasters recommended in the Flynn report has been implemented by An Post this month. The company has also recently won a contract to provide over the counter bill payment services for the ESB. They will build on the existing bill pay facilities provided by An Post and will be an important source of income for the network going forward. I expect a report from the forum by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is the responsibility of the boards and management of the various public enterprises concerned to assess the impact of the economic downturn on their operations and to put in place whatever measures are required to ensure that their long-term viability is sustained. Over the past four years I have worked to ensure that a secure platform for sustainable development has been built in each of the pivotal infrastructural sectors of transport, energy and communications. I am satisfied that this work has laid the foundations for further progress into the future and will help to underpin not only the survival but also the growth and increased competitiveness of these public enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the transport area there has been unprecedented funding made available to secure the future of public transport both in Dublin and the <Col N="169" /> regions. Significant investment has occurred at the State and regional airports. Luas light rail construction is under way and on target for completion by the promised date of October 2003. Electricity and aviation regulators are now in place. Full liberalisation has been effected in the telecommunications sector and has commenced in the electricity and gas sectors and will be fully effected by 2005. Great advances have been made in the roll out of digital broadband infrastructure to the regions. There is an unprecedented programme of investment in natural gas infrastructure that will bring both Corrib and imported gas to many new areas of the country as well as to existing customers.</P>
    <P>I and the Government fully intend to press forward and build on these achievements in the coming years. I am confident that the public enterprises under my aegis are robust enough to withstand the effects of the downturn in world economies and will emerge leaner and more efficient to meet the challenges and exploit the opportunities when the upturn occurs.</P>

Central to the strategic thrust of the plan is a proposal for the development of suburban rail services linking Blarney, Cork and Midleton. Iarnród Éireann expects to be in a position to commence shortly a detailed feasibility study into the potential for developing these rail services.

      <P>Under section 31 of the Copyright Act, 1963, disputes between persons using sound recordings in public and the owner of the copyright subsisting in the recordings regarding the equitable remuneration payable to the copyright owner may be referred to the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, who may appoint an arbitrator to deal with the case. In the period September 1989 to December 1995, 62 references were made by establishments using sound recordings.</P>
      <P>On 15 July 1996, the controller appointed an arbitrator who was agreed upon by the parties to deal with these references. The controller has informed me that he has engaged in correspondence with the arbitrator since his appointment with a view to being kept up to date in relation to the progress of the work and to expediting the conclusion of the assignment.</P>
      <P>In February 2001, the arbitrator wrote to the controller indicating, <i>inter alia,</i> that the arbitration process was now coming to a conclusion; that to date hearings had been held on seven separate days in respect of several sample cases; and that dates had been fixed for the exchange of final written submissions and the hearing of the final oral submissions. The arbitrator also indicated that he believed it was best to clarify with the parties the process which they wished to undertake in relation to the remaining cases as the current hearing effectively related to two venues selected from among the referring establishments. The intention was that a formula which the arbitrator would include in his award in respect of the sample cases would be accepted for the purpose of settling the remaining cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The controller wrote to the arbitrator on 25 October 2001 requesting information on the <Col N="175" /> status of the arbitration and is awaiting a reply to this letter.</P>
    <P>Following the concerns expressed in the matter by the Deputy, I have requested the controller to again follow up this matter with the arbitrator with a view to establishing quickly the status of the arbitration.</P>

      <Quest> if a company which has been dissolved by the Companies Office can continue to trade legally as a bona fide company; if the company can be a recipient of grant aid from the Government; if the company can retain grants previously given before dissolvement; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>A company that has been dissolved no longer legally exists and cannot continue to trade, hold assets or receive State grants. State agencies have due diligence procedures in place to ensure that payments are in order so that the question of paying grants after dissolution should not arise.</P>
      <P>Under section 28 of the State Property Act, 1954, all property and land vested in, or held in trust for, a body corporate immediately before its dissolution becomes, upon dissolution, the property of the State and is vested in the Minister for Finance. However, it is possible for a company to be restored to the register.</P>
      <P>Under section 311A of the Companies Act, 1963, a company that has been dissolved can be restored to the register of companies by making an application to the Registrar of Companies within 12 months of its dissolution. Alternatively, under section 311 of the Companies Act, 1963, a company, member or creditor can also seek to have a dissolved company restored to the register, within a period of 20 years from its dissolution, by seeking a High Court order to that effect. A company that is restored to the register is deemed to have continued in existence as if its name had not been struck off.</P>

      <Quest> if a dissolved company can have effective and operational insurance cover in place even though dissolved; if an insurance company insuring against damage occurring as a result of activities by a company now dissolved has liabilities in respect of damage caused by a company whom it has insured; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>A company that has been dissolved has no continuing legal existence. It cannot, therefore, continue to hold insurance post-dissolution. Post-dissolution, if the business formerly carried on by the dissolved company is still being carried on, the persons operating that business are the legal owners of the business and ought to have insurance in their personal capacity to indemnify them against any claims that may be made in respect of damage occurring as a result of the activities of that business.</P>
      <P>If, however, the dissolved company is restored to the register, either administratively within 12 months of the date of dissolution, or by court order within 20 years, the company is deemed by law to have continued in existence as if it had never been struck off, and so any policy of insurance that may have been taken out in its name during the post-dissolution period will be retrospectively validated.</P>
      <P>In relation to the activities of the company pre-dissolution, while the circumstances in any individual case will vary, it would be normal practice for a person taking action for damages arising from those activities to seek through the Circuit Court as a creditor of the dissolved company to have the company restored to the register of companies for the purposes of those proceedings, as it is the company that is required to be named as defendant to the proceedings, and it has no legal standing so long as it remains dissolved.</P>

      <P>In November 2000, my Department forwarded to Waterford County Council for consideration and subject to my approval, a draft foreshore licence in relation to the provision of a sewerage scheme at Cheekpoint. The draft included a specific requirement for the retrofitting of an ultra violet or equivalent disinfection system if such a system was considered by me to be necessary in the light of the results of monitoring shellfish in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waterford County Council advised my Department in July 2001 that it was prepared to accept the draft foreshore licence subject only to the outcome of negotiations between my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in relation to the detail of the tertiary treatment required. Those negotiations centre on detailed implementation of my decision on 8 May 2001 that there must be tertiary treatment, including ultra violet or equivalent disinfection of sewage in any case where there are <Col N="179" /> shellfish and are expected to conclude shortly when a submission will be made to me.</P>

      <P>Member states are legally obliged under the CFP to put in place effective measures to manage and respect their respective fish quota entitlements. All member states have their own national systems for quota management which will involve national decisions on restrictions and/or closures of fisheries for their fishermen dependant on their utilisation of quota entitlements. Ireland is responsible for managing and monitoring the take up by Irish fishermen of national quota.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific instances outlined by the Deputy the position is that the Irish cod quota off the south and west coast has been exhausted and the fishery is therefore closed. The haddock fishery in the same area was recently closed for two weeks but following successful negotiation of quota swop of haddock with France it has been possible to re-open that fishery.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the issues of concern to which the question refers date back to 1992 and involved Waterford Harbour Commissioners as the predecessor body to the Port of Waterford Company and representatives of fishermen from Cheekpoint, County Waterford. I <Col N="180" /> have sought a report from the port company and I am advised as follows: the nature of the settlement agreed between both sides was entirely arbitrary with payment being made to identified licence holders but in the absence of identified proof as to the actual losses incurred. In the course of protracted negotiations, no objections were raised to those representing the fishermen. In these circumstances, the port authority conducted negotiations and agreed the eventual settlement in good faith and in the belief that the negotiators were representative of all the affected parties.</P>

      <P>In July this year, two on-shore petroleum exploration licences were granted over an area in the north-west Carboniferous Basin, to Evergreen Resources, an American based company. The licensed area comprises lands in counties Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo and straddles the border with Fermanagh. Evergreen commenced drilling of a well in Dowra, County Cavan on 20 October last and operations are continuing on this well. The company intends to drill a second exploration well this year in County Leitrim. Drilling for gas was carried out in the area in question some years ago and the present interest reflects a confidence based on both the results then and recent evaluations carried out by another American based company, Priority Oil and Gas, under licensing options held over the same area which expired at the end of June last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards non-petroleum minerals, there were 35 extant prospecting licences covering areas in Counties Monaghan and Cavan and they were held by 2 companies at 30 June 2001, the date of my most recent statutory six monthly report to <Col N="181" /> the Oireachtas. There has been no significant economic find of minerals in the two counties in the past five years.</P>

      <P>Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited and its partners, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Marathon International Petroleum (Hibernia) Limited, declared the Corrib gas field commercial last January and Enterprise Energy Ireland, as operator for the development of the Corrib field, applied to me on 9 January, 2001 for a petroleum lease. A petroleum lease under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, demising the petroleum in the Corrib gas field to Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited and its partners, was granted by me on 15 November 2001.</P>
      <P>The Corrib gas field project including the terminal is privately funded by Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited and its partners Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Marathon International Petroleum (Hibernia) Limited. There is no financial contribution from the Exchequer. The Corrib group has purchased the terminal site from Coillte Teoranta and is at present negotiating way leaves agreements with the property owners over whose land the proposed pipeline will be routed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits to the people of north Mayo will include the opportunities for employment during the construction phase of the development and permanent employment at the terminal when it <Col N="182" /> become operational. Enterprise Energy Ireland anticipates that Irish contractors and suppliers will feature prominently in the terminal construction team. It is also anticipated that the development will also provide more localised benefits for the duration of the construction period. These include increased trade in local shops and service industries and accommodation providers as well as indirect employment. Enterprise Energy Ireland intends that where possible these employment opportunities will be filled by the local population with appropriate training provided as required.</P>

      <P>A composite lease dated 22 May 1996 was agreed between the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Marine and Irish Steel Limited for a term of 35 years. Irish Steel Limited was sold on 30 May 1996 and the company's name was changed to Irish Ispat Limited. Irish Ispat Limited is in voluntary liquidation at present. The total leased area, was approximately 16.75 hectares. The lease interest in these lands now rests with the liquidator, who is also responsible for the associated lease payments The liquidator may (a) seek to dispose of the interest in the leases to a third party, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in consultation with the Minister for Finance or (b) surrender the lease to the Minister as lessor. The current market value of the land in question is not known.</P>

    <P>Since the appointment of the liquidator, my Department in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Defence has been carefully monitoring the situation and has written <Col N="183" /> to the liquidator seeking clarification of a number of issues. The Deputy can rest assured that every care will be taken to ensure that the State's interests are fully protected and that the liquidation process will be closely monitored to ensure the best long-term use of the leased area. I have arranged for a copy of the map showing the lands in question to be provided to the Deputy.</P>

The reports referred to by the Deputy were jointly commissioned by my Department and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and were published in October.</P>
      <P>Since publication, both Administrations have been giving consideration to how best to move this important process forward. It has been agreed to hold a high level restricted seminar in December involving the respective regulatory agencies, grid operators and some other key players in the energy sector as well as senior officials from both Departments. This seminar is intended to provide a forum for identifying the main issues in the creation of an all-island energy market. In addition, it will establish a clearer understanding of how best the agenda can be moved forward in terms of determining clear roles and responsibilities for the various players in the process. I assure the Deputy that both administrations fully appreciate the importance of consultation with the wider market and this will be an important feature of the process going forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadband communications networks have become an important piece of enabling economic infrastructure in recent years. The importance of broadband is based on the emergence of the Internet and e-mail as key business tools. My Department is committed to working in partnership with telecommunications services providers to ensure the widest possible availability of these services. Planning for the regional delivery of broadband is done in close association with Forfás, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development, Údarás na Gaeltachta and other development bodies with the central objectives of regional enterprise development and job creation in mind.</P>
      <P>I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives under national policy, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly by bringing broadband connectivity to regional and rural areas.</P>
      <P>In the final year of the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, the Government made 26 million &ndash; £21 million &ndash; available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled-out broadband nationwide were supported and are now nearing completion. The majority of these projects entailed the rolling out of broadband services in the Border, midlands and western counties. The figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives by this Government has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to 200 million &ndash; £157 million. There is a commitment that two-thirds of this budget will be spent in the Border, midlands and western region. A first call for proposals was run last year and on foot of submissions received the Department of Public Enterprise entered nine contracts at the beginning of the year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. The projects involved will be completed over the next two years and will entail overall investment of 160 million &ndash; £126 million &ndash; in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately 55 million &ndash; £43 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> At the beginning of August this year I announced the second call for proposals. The deadline for receipt of proposals was 19 October. Again, 55 million &ndash; £43 million &ndash; is available to promote the investment in communications infrastructure. Three programme lines are supported under the present invitation to tender, these are: (1) private sector broadband roll-outs; (2) private sector DSL roll-out; and (3) public sector projects with economic development and social objectives. As a result of this second call for proposals, 31 projects are now being evaluated by an independent evaluation committee. Details of these programmes are available at www.ndpcomms.gov.ie </P>

      <P>The forthcoming Communications (Regulation) Bill contains provisions relating to access by telecommunications operators to public highways for the construction of telecommunications networks. Under the Bill, it is proposed that such operators will be required to obtain the consent of the road authority before they can open a road to lay telecommunications infrastructure in that authority's functional area. It is also proposed that a road authority will be able to make its consent subject to specific conditions enabling it to co-ordinate road openings and to require operators to share trenches and provide spare ducts for future use by other telecommunications operators.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that conditions laid down by the road authorities must be non-discriminatory and transparent. The Bill also enables the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make regulations, after consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise, governing the conditions that may be laid down by road authorities. It is envisaged that these new proposals will enable road authorities to properly control access to public highways by telecommunications operators, without unduly inhibiting the installation of telecommunications infrastructure around the country. The current position is that Bill is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. My Department is actively pursuing the matter with the Government Legislation Committee in order that the Bill will be assigned due priority in the legislation programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently 22 wind farms in commercial operation in the country with a total installed capacity of 125 megawatts. The electricity generated from wind energy represents just under 1% of electricity consumption. This equates to the needs of approximately 70,000 homes and the displacement of about 280,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. I have set a target to support the construction, by 2005, of an additional 500 megawatts of renewable energy based electricity generating capacity. The greater part of this target will be delivered by the wind energy sector. In May this year I launched the fifth competition in the AER series. The capacity on offer at 255 MW is the largest single offering to the market ever. The balance of the target, 245 megawatts, will be offered to the market as soon as is practicable to ensure the overall target is achieved by 2005. National support for wind energy technologies in electricity production <Col N="187" /> commenced in the mid 1990s. Having regard to scale, it is on a par with Britain which has some 60 wind farms operating with an installed capacity of around 415 MW. Countries like Denmark and Holland have a higher percentage of wind generated electricity where such investment commenced in the 1970s.</P>

      <P>The market for telecommunications was liberalised in 1998 and there are no plans to set up a new semi-State organisation responsible for the roll-out and management of telecommunications and broadband infrastructure. The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in the fully liberalised market.

      <P>MediaLab Europe, which was established as a third level research and educational facility in a partnership between the Irish Government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is now entering its second year of operations. The focus in its first year was on recruitment and facilities development as well as establishing its profile for commercial sponsorship of its research. There is now a top class research team in place comprising 40 full-time researchers and 20 post-graduate researchers admitted under MediaLab Europe's two year fellowship programme. The staffing and student <Col N="188" /> intake is composed of Irish, European and US nationals.</P>
      <P>Research is spread over a number of areas such as the use of technology that can enable or empower people who are otherwise marginalised; interfaces where touch is used instead of or in addition to sight and sound; the dynamics of wireless networks and applications; everyday learning; mobile technologies; use of technology for physical and mental health and the future of music and story networks. In addition, a number of projects are funded by the Higher Education Authority as part of a scheme to facilitate collaboration between MediaLab Europe and Irish universities.</P>
      <P>As part of the agreement to establish MediaLab Europe, the Government undertook to provide a suitable premises. Purchase of the former Guinness hopstore building and an adjacent former Guinness property has now been completed and MediaLab Europe is working with the Office of Public Works on refurbishment plans. In line with this agreement, the buildings will remain in State hands.</P>
      <P>In the broader context, the slowdown in the high tech sector, particularly in the USA, has certainly increased the challenge for MediaLab Europe to secure commercial sponsorship of its research activities. However, MediaLab Europe's prime target is European industry from a diverse range of sectors including but also beyond the information and communications technology or ICT sector. In addition, MediaLab Europe is just one part of a long-term strategy to develop our R&amp;D capacity and move our IT sector up the value chain. In the current climate it is all the more important that we continue this approach to ensure that Ireland maintains its position internationally and is ready to take advantage of future growth opportunities.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for ensuring the safety of railway operations, including rolling stock, is a matter for Iarnród Éireann and is not one in which I have a function.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann received a report in February 2001 from consultants Halcrow Group Limited whom it had commissioned to review its strategy for controlling crowding on commuter trains in the Dublin area. The report noted that Iarnród Éireann recognised that the older slam door rolling stock is unsuitable for use on a modern commuter railway. The report also noted that Iarnród Éireann has scheduled the oldest rolling stock in use on commuter routes, that is, the Craven and Mark IIA stock, for replacement by the end of 2003, with the slightly more modern Mark IID stock being scheduled for reduction in use on commuter routes by 2003 and fully replaced by 2005. The consultants concluded that more rapid replacement of these vehicles could be achieved only with loss of capacity on key routes, increasing pressure on crowding and its attendant risks and recommended against removing older rolling stock from service without immediate replacement.</P>
      <P>The consultants noted that Iarnród Éireann has in place certain special procedures in regard to older rolling stock and recommended that these should continue. The consultants also recommended a package of further measures for detailed consideration by Iarnród Éireann and I am awaiting the result of Iarnród Éireann's evaluation of those options. I understand Iarnród Éireann is satisfied that, pending replacement, older rolling stock is safe for use on commuter routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To address the current difficulties, the Government is committed to providing additional capacity on the railway network. Significant funding has been, and continues to be, made available to Iarnród Éireann for investment to improve the safety of the network, increase the physical capacity of the system and improve the quality, reliability and speed of services. In 2000, ten new DART cars were brought into service and an additional 16 DART cars have already entered service this year. A further 12 DART cars have <Col N="191" /> recently been delivered and will go into service early next year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the suburban network, 20 diesel railcars were delivered in 2000 for use on the upgraded Maynooth line. A further 80 diesel railcars are on order for delivery in 2002-03. The first of these is due for delivery in June 2002. Furthermore, the national development plan also provides for the acquisition by Iarnród Éireann of 20 new mainline rail carriages. I understand that Iarnród Éireann is currently evaluating proposals in that regard but that the board has not yet taken a decision in the matter and no formal proposals have been submitted to my Department.</P>
    <P>The ongoing delivery of the new rolling stock will substantially increase the available capacity and also enable Iarnród Éireann to retire the older rolling stock.</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann has informed me that all platforms on the outer suburban network serving Dublin have been extended to cater for eight car trains. Many of the platforms on the DART rail line are also capable of taking eight car trains. However, a number of DART platforms, particularly Tara Street, require extensions to accommodate eight car DART trains. In this regard, planning is under way on a DART upgrade project and Exchequer funding has been provided for platform extensions and increased power supply to facilitate eight car DART trains.</P>
      <P>In relation to Tara Street, proposals to develop the station facilities and site, including platforms, are awaiting planning approval from Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my previous reply of 23 October 2001. On that occasion I stated the policy at EU level on the co-ordinated introduction of a third generation mobile and wireless communications, UMTS, in the Community was determined by a European Parliament and Council decision of 14 December 1999, Decision No. 128/1999/EC. This decision requires that member states take all actions necessary to allow, in accordance with the EU licensing directive, the co-ordinated and progressive introduction of 3G services in their territory by 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for implementing the requirements of the decision rests with the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. This is subject to any public service requirements for licensing spectrum that I may specify in accordance with section 4(9) of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, and to my consent to regulations under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts to establish the licensing of the spectrum to be used for 3G. I have not specified any public service requirements under section 4(9) of the 1996 Act and I have not yet received any proposed regulations from the director for my consent.</P>
      <P>The determination of the appropriate number of service providers to license for provision of 3G services and the award of licences is a matter for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. Following a public consultation and analysis of the market and spectrum availability, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation decided to license four service providers and has outlined the licensing framework to be employed. The setting of licence fees is a matter for the ODTR and the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The CER has informed my Department that it is satisfied there will be adequate capacity for the coming winter period to meet the needs of electricity customers, given the availability of short-term generation. I have been assured that the commission will continue to monitor the situation closely. I am pleased to note that the Generation Adequacy Statement, 2001-2007, published by ESB national grid in May 2001 shows that in the medium term, the commissioning of large scale generation plant projected for 2002 will lead to a significant improvement in the generation adequacy position. In the longer term, assuming a properly functioning market with adequate investor incentives, national grid has stated that there is no reason that generation adequacy should not be maintained within standard from 2003 onwards. It is not my function under the Act to give directions to the CER on the adequacy of power supplies.</P>
      <P>With regard to natural gas, Bord Gáis has informed my Department that it is satisfied that there will be adequate capacity for the coming winter period to meet the needs of gas consumers.

The bulk of this target will come from the wind energy technology.</P>
      <P>The revised target will be achieved through an open tender arrangement or by independent developers operating in the electricity market which was entirely liberalised for renewable energy based electricity under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. As part of the process to ensure the target is delivered by 2005, I have launched the fifth competition in the AER series, AER V. Through the competition, contracts for 255 MW of renewable energy based plant &ndash; or half the 500 megawatt target &ndash; have been offered, including 200 megawatts in the large scale wind energy category and a further 40 megawatts in the small scale wind energy category.

      <Quest>the extent to which she expects to achieve the targets set by and for her Department in the national development plan; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the position in relation to allocations and expenditure under the national development plan in the transport, energy and communications areas.</P>
      <P>With regard to public transport, over the seven years of the national development plan, it is proposed to invest £2.2 billion or 2.8 billion in public transport. The greater Dublin area will benefit from a £1.6 billion or 2.03 billion investment in public transport and £650 million or 825 million is being allocated under the NDP proposals to address regional transport requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant progress has already been made in achieving these targets. More than £450 million or 570 million has already been spent on projects since the commencement of the plan which has resulted in additional capacity on both bus and rail networks and greater frequency of bus and rail services. The implementation of the railway safety programme is progressing with more than 200 miles of track and more than 100 miles of fencing completed, 190 bridges renewed and safety improvements on more than 180 level crossings. The Luas project is on target for entering into service in 2003 with the trams already being delivered. The planning and design stage of such strategically important projects as <Col N="195" /> the Kildare route project and the DART enhancement project are nearing completion and development plans for the metro are at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with CIE, is monitoring the progress of projects being funded under the national development plan and taking the necessary steps, where possible, to ensure that projects are completed within budget and in the agreed timeframe.</P>
    <P>Under the airports measure of the national development plan, a sum of £11 million or 13.97 million, in 1999 prices, was allocated to assist with necessary infrastructural upgrades and improvements at the six regional airports. This amount was apportioned as £8 million or 10.16 million in respect of the four airports in the BMW region and £3 million or 3.81 million in respect of the two airports in the south and east region. A further sum of £3 million or 3.81 million was subsequently allocated to the south and east region, bringing the total allocation for that region to £6 million or 7.62 million and the overall total under the measure to £14 million or 17.78 million.</P>
    <P>There has been no expenditure to date of this amount. However, my Department is continuing the process of securing all relevant information regarding the projects from the six regional airport authorities and it is anticipated that the selection of a number of safety related projects will be finalised shortly. I am confident that the projects which will be selected can be completed within the overall time frame of the plan.</P>
    <P>Under the sustainable energy priority within the framework of the national development plan, £175.2 million or 222.5 million is earmarked for investment. My Department has overall responsibility for the administration of this funding and the Irish Energy Centre, IEC, which operates under the aegis of my Department, is the main conduit for implementing this priority. In the energy sector, a key priority in the national development plan is to identify those areas of expenditure which will assist Ireland in complying with its obligation under the Kyoto Protocol, which is to limit the growth of greenhouse gas emissions by 13% above 1990 levels. The strategy is to pursue least cost approaches to achieving more sustainable energy services and systems.</P>
    <P>The focus of the strategy being pursued is on energy efficiency, conservation and the promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources. The Department's policy is fully elaborated in the Green Paper on sustainable energy, which was published by the Minister of State in September 1999. The primary implementing body for energy efficiency is the Irish Energy Centre and much of the emphasis at this stage is on building capacity in the centre to enable it to deliver the ambitious plans foreseen in the NDP. Already a number of new and exciting programmes have been launched by the Minister of State following work carried out by the centre. <Col N="196" /> These are designed to ensure the energy sector continues to play its part in assisting the national effort to meet our targets under the protocol.</P>
    <P>In relation to renewable energy, I have set a revised target to support the construction of an additional 500 megawatts of renewable energy based electricity generating capacity to be installed by 2005. The bulk of this target will come from wind energy. As part of the process to ensure the target is delivered by 2005, I have launched the fifth competition in the alternative energy requirement, AER, series. The closing date for the competition is the end of this month. It is expected that AER V will result in an additional 250 MW of electricity generated from renewables which will come on stream up to the end of 2004. The balance of the target, 245 megawatts, will be offered to the market as soon as is practicable so as to ensure the overall target is achieved by 2005. Work on the NDP initiative to improve the capacity of the electricity grid to accept renewable energy plant is progressing.</P>
    <P>Recognising the importance of telecommunications and digital industries to the economic development of the country, the Government remains committed to the development of a world class communications and information technology sector and an environment that will further facilitate e-business and ICT industries. In order that rural and regional areas may be in a position to attract and promote further investment in the ICT sector, the Government has set aside £158 million or 200 million in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to promote and co-fund the roll-out of advanced communications networks in rural and underdeveloped areas of the country.</P>
    <P>Nine contracts worth £44 million or 56 million were signed with five companies in early 2001, following a competitive tender process and these projects will result in a total investment of about £134 million or 170 million in advanced ICT infrastructure. A second call for proposals was issued in July of this year with the aim of further developing broadband communications infrastructure and services to enable the uptake of the information society in the BMW and south and east regions. Organisations were invited to submit tenders under one of three programmes: commercial broadband rollout projects, commercial DSL rollout projects to areas prioritised in conjunction with Forfás, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, and public projects with economic development and social objectives for which public bodies were eligible to tender.</P>
    <P>As a result of this second call, 31 proposals have been received. Twenty of these proposals are applications made by local authorities-public bodies. The other 11 are proposals from private sector companies. I am confident that the projects which have been selected to date and which will be selected under the new call for proposals can be completed within the overall time frame of the plan, achieving its objectives and intended level of expenditure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>The following tables indicate the number of cases of BSE reported in this country for each month to date since 1989; the age of each positive animal and the county in which each case was detected.  The information relating to the county of birth of each of the positive animals is not readily available in the format required.</P>
      <P>The number of confirmed cases of BSE has increased this year, as a result of the additional surveillance conducted among fallen and casualty animals and among animals over thirty months of age. Of the 210 cases confirmed this year, 83 were confirmed in fallen animals which would not, in any event, have been intended for the human food chain. Finally, it is noteworthy that despite the vastly increased levels of active surveillance this year &ndash; 499,899 tests &ndash; no case has been confirmed in an animal born after May 1996. This is a positive indication that the enhanced BSE controls introduced in 1996 are having the desired results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Provisions for the control of letting, subletting and subdivision of agricultural holdings are laid down in section 3 of the Land Act, 1927, section 6 of the Land Act, 1946, and section 12 of the Land Act, 1965. Consent to letting, subletting, and subdivision was formerly granted by the Land Commission and is now granted by the Minister, pursuant to the Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> The owner of an agricultural holding is required to apply in writing to the Minister for consent if the holding being let, sublet or subdivided is greater than one hectare in size. The only ground for refusal of consent is laid out in section 12(2) of the Land Act, 1965, which states, &ldquo;The power of the Land Commission to withhold their consent under this section shall be exercised solely to prevent the creation or continuance of holdings which, in the opinion of the Land Commission, are not economic holdings&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is no record in my Department of any application by a landowner for consent to let sublet or subdivide his-her agricultural holding being refused over the past five years.</P>
    <P>Applications for consent under section 12 have become a formality except for those landowners who have outstanding land purchase-land reclamation annuities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The parliamentary questions and letter refer to a 1998 area aid application submitted by the person named. The application included a parcel of land which was also claimed by another herdowner who was able to provide documentary proof that he was renting the parcel. Accordingly, this parcel was included in the other applicant's entitlement. However no area aid penalty was applied to the person named as the error was treated as a genuine mistake and his application was processed excluding the parcel concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the 1999 and 2000 area aid applications have been cleared, there are queries on parcels in <Col N="205" /> the 2001 application and the person named has been written to about these and a response is awaited. His 2001 area aid application cannot be finalised until these matters are resolved.</P>
    <P>Any payments due to the person must be withheld to the extent necessary to offset an overpayment made to him under the rural environment protection scheme. My Department notified the person named of this in November 2000.</P>

      <P>The person named entered the scheme of early retirement from farming in joint management with her husband. The EU regulation under which the scheme was introduced requires that the pension payable under the scheme be reduced by the amount of any national retirement pension to which the applicant, or in joint management arrangements the applicant's spouse or partner, becomes entitled.</P>
      <P>In this particular case both the person named and her husband have qualified for non-contributory old age pensions and the combined value of these has been deducted from the early retirement pension. As the gross amount of early retirement pension is fixed, any increases in the rate of old age pension result in a reduction in the balance of the early retirement pension that can be paid to them. The person named has received her full entitlement to date under the early retirement scheme.</P>

    <P>The livestock unit value of milk quota is obtained by dividing the producer's milk quota in respect of a given calendar year by the national average yield per cow for that year, or by the recorded average milk yield per cow for the year where the producer is in an official milk recording scheme.

    <P>The premium for one animal for special beef premium is £107.11. As the producer was only entitled to payment in respect of 0.15 LU he received £21.42, 80% of his full special beef premium entitlement for 2001.</P>

      <P>My Department does not operate any specific schemes of financial assistance to animal welfare bodies. In recent years, however, I have made <i>ex gratia</i> funding available to a number of appropriate bodies, having regard to moneys available to me from within the Department's Vote at the end of the year. Grants issued to organisations involved in the delivery of animal care and welfare services throughout the country totalled £210,000 to ten organisations in 1998, £312,000 to 22 organisations in 1999 and £487,500 to 43 organisations in 2000. The organisations concerned had approached the Department during each of the years in question seeking financial assistance.</P>
      <P>As the payment of such aid is invariably an end of year exercise dependent on the resources available within the Department's Vote, any disbursements for 2001 will again be entirely contingent on funds being available for this purpose. Subject to that proviso, my Department will in due course assess the approaches made by various animal welfare bodies during the current year.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has to date submitted six applications, in respect of 100 animals, for the 2001 special beef premium scheme. Three animals were deleted for payment purposes as payments had already been made in respect of first stage premium and the animals concerned were not eligible for the second stage of the special beef premium at the time of application. Payment of £5,312.58 issued on 8 November 2001 in relation to 80% of the premium due on 62 animals. Payment will issue on the remaining 35 animals when outstanding issues in relation to information on the cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, in respect of these animals have been resolved.</P>

      <P>The information available to me indicates that, with the exception of one member state, antibiotics for the treatment of mastitis in cows are subject to prescription con<Col N="209" /> trol throughout the EU. The European Commission is aware of Ireland's view that the operation of prescription regimes across member states needs to be harmonised in the interests of more effective regulation of the EU veterinary medicines market. This aspect will be further pursued in the context of forthcoming discussions on a package of Commission proposals affecting the veterinary medicines sector.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board has recommended that intramammary antibiotic medicines should be brought under prescription control. I have also drawn attention to the fact that it is recognised in the relevant report from the IMB that there would be difficulties in applying the current prescription rules in Irish legislation to intramammaries. Accordingly, my Department is now engaged in considering what changes to existing legislation will be necessary in order to have an effective and workable prescription regime applying to intramammaries. In this context, my Department has sought the views and suggestions of stakeholders on the optimum arrangements which might apply. Some stakeholders have already responded and I expect this process to be completed within the coming weeks. In formulating its proposals, my Department will not alone have regard to the views expressed by stakeholders, within the context of putting in place a suitable prescription regime but will also have due regard to arrangements in operation in other member states of the EU where prescription regimes currently apply to intramammaries.  </P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>To date some 14,000 applications have been received to participate in the new rural environment protection scheme which was launched on 27 November 2000. By the end of the year it is anticipated that this figure will have reached 15,000. This is the largest volume of applications in any year since the first REP scheme was introduced in 1994. The highest number in a previous year was 13,000 in 1996. Of the applications received so far this year, more than 11,350, 82%, have already been approved and paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is too soon to determine a clear pattern in the take-up of REPS. The restrictions on farm visits during the foot and mouth disease emergency meant that REPS planners could not go on to farms to prepare agri-environmental plans for <Col N="212" /> potential applicants. This created a backlog of applications which was compounded by the fact that large numbers of participants in the first scheme came to the end of their contracts this year and would have been expected to apply for the new scheme.</P>
    <P>Almost nine out of ten applications for the new scheme are from farmers who took part in the previous one. While the most recent data available to my Department would suggest that a number of farmers have not yet re-applied for REPS, it is not possible to say whether this is because they have not decided to re-apply, or because their planners' current workload has delayed their applications. The same difficulty arises in trying to draw conclusions from the number of applications from farmers who were not previously in REPS.</P>
    <P>I accept that the burden of paperwork may deter some farmers from applying for REPS. However, my Department is obliged to operate the scheme within the EU guidelines, and as a result, there is little that can be done to cut down the complexity and amount of the paperwork involved. There are other reasons farmers could decide not to join REPS, or why those who took part in the first scheme could decide not to re-apply. Participants in REPS have to adopt extensive farming practices that some may consider unduly onerous or commercially unattractive. Some farmers may be discouraged by the cost of having applications prepared. Some participants in the former scheme may have incurred penalties for non-compliance which made them reluctant to take on new undertakings.</P>

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to the 13th issue savings certificates, a scheme which started in 1996 and matured in August of this year. On maturity, the scheme was closed and investors were given the opportunity either to encash their investment or to reinvest their money in the current, 16th, issue of savings certificates. These savings schemes are operated on my behalf by the National Treasury Management Agency through An Post.</P>
      <P>It is not considered appropriate to extend the conditions of any given savings scheme beyond the date of maturity, as the criteria for a savings scheme are set in the context of the prevailing interest rate climate. As such, the interest rates applying to the 1996 scheme were higher than those currently available. Since moneys invested in such savings schemes constitute a part of the national debt, extension of a scheme to which high interest rates apply would increase the cost of debt service. The investor still has the option, however, of reinvesting their money in another scheme or savings product, or of setting up a special savings incentive account through any of the many financial institutions which offer the accounts.</P>

      <P>The Mount Street crèche is operated by the Civil Service crèche co-operative. I have made substantial public funds available to assist the co-operative to refurbish and equip the premises and to operate the crèche. For the past year or so, a private sector company has been engaged by the co-operative to provide child care services in the Mount Street crèche. The care being provided for children in Mount Street by the co-operative and the company involved is of the very highest standard, while the rates charged to parents are below those in other crèches of a similar quality.</P>
      <P>As I explained in my answer to the Deputy's previous question, the viability of the crèche depends on a weekly rate being charged in respect of each place. Where places are taken by the children of part-time staff, the remaining period must also be used by other part-time staff. I understand the co-operative and the operator make every effort to find a partner for staff. In particular, the operator maintains a list of part-time staff who may wish to use the crèche and who can be contacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no particular views on the operation of private crèches. The operation of private crèches is a matter for the operators and the parents who <Col N="216" /> use them. It is likely that a private crèche provider would decide to cater for part-time workers by charging part-time rates in the light of commercial considerations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the payment of an allowance by an employer to an employee who uses a bicycle to get to and from work would be taxable under the general income tax charging provisions as a perquisite of the employment. Similarly, any payment made to an employee for use of a bicycle in the course of his-her work over and above the Civil Service mileage rate for bicycles would be taxable &ndash; the rate is currently 5 pence or 6.35 cent per mile and is used as a benchmark rate elsewhere.</P>
      <P>There is, essentially, only one exception to the rule relating to the taxability of payments made to employees for travel to and from work. In budget 1999, I introduced a tax exemption from benefit-in-kind where employers purchase monthly or annual bus and rail travel passes for their employees. The Revenue Commissioners agreed last year that the exemption can, subject to certain conditions, apply in the context of salary sacrifice: that is, where an employee agrees to forgo or sacrifice part of his/her salary <i>in lieu</i> of the provision of the travel pass by the employer. Such a scheme has recently been introduced in the Civil Service. However, I have no plans to provide an exemption from tax of the kind sought by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is not the normal practice for the Minister for Finance to comment in the week before budget day on any taxation proposal. <Col N="217" /> However, I would, nevertheless, like to point out what I have done in this area. In the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, I made significant changes to the stamp duty regime on transfers of residential property arising from the recommendations of the third Bacon report into the housing market. The Act introduced a three-tiered stamp duty structure for first-time buyers, owner-occupiers other than first-time buyers and investors. I considerably reduced the stamp duty rates applying to the different bands up to £300,000, 380,921, in respect of first-time purchasers of second-hand residential property. I also increased the exemption from stamp duty from £60,000 &ndash; 76,184 &ndash; to £150,000 &ndash; 190,460 &ndash; in the case of such first-time buyers. Also, rates of stamp duty for first-time buyers of second-hand houses at values in excess of £150,000 &ndash; 190,460 &ndash; and up to £300,000 &ndash; 380,921 &ndash; are now 25% less than for other owner-occupiers. Limiting these concessions to first-time purchasers maintains their relative advantage in the second-hand market which accounts for two-thirds of first-time purchaser transactions.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works and the Sisters of Mercy agreed the sale of portion of the convent building and lands at Convent Road, Roscommon town for the development of Government offices in Roscommon town. Prior to conclusion of the legal formalities, the Sisters of Mercy sought to alter the transaction as they wished to retain the convent buildings for their own purposes. The Commissioners of Public Works are happy to accede to their request as the buildings were not necessary for the proposed development to provide offices for the Departments of Health and Children, Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Education and Science, Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners. In addition, the Departments involved altered their requirements and these changes are being incorporated in the tender documentation. This process is complete, and tenders will be invited this week that is, the week ending 30 November 2001, for a design build competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that regular, systematic checks are carried out to identify taxpayers who may have underpaid income tax. The taxpayer came to notice because the combined income of the taxpayer and his wife was substantially higher in the 1999-2000 tax year than it had been in 1998-99. The increase in <Col N="220" /> income meant that some of the taxpayer's income became liable to tax at the higher rate. However, the taxpayer did not alert the tax office to the increased income and tax continued to be deducted at the standard rate only. This resulted in the taxpayer underpaying £1,652.28 &ndash; 2,097.96 &ndash; in 1999-2000. The inspector proposes to collect the underpayment over a two-year period beginning on 1 January 2002.</P>

However, as the Deputy may be aware, I also provided that passive individual investors in three star standard and upward hotels located in seven counties in the north and north-west of the country may fully offset capital allowances on these hotels against all income, that is, non-rental income as well as rental income. The purpose of this relaxation was to promote investment in the provision of quality hotel accommodation in these counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers' Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, six dentists for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North Eastern Health Board and South Eastern Health Board commenced their training in October last for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will <Col N="223" /> play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October last. Capital funding of approximately £1 million &ndash; 1.269 million &ndash; was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard. My Department would welcome proposals for a specialist training programme from this university and the consultant orthodontists of the Southern Health Board and neighbouring boards.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million &ndash; 6.729 million &ndash; has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million &ndash; 4.698 million &ndash; is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as part of the initiative, my Department is also exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out of hours sessions by health board orthodontists. The Southern Health Board (SHB) has been allocated an additional £0.938 million &ndash; 1.191 million &ndash; this year for orthodontic services of which £0.813 million &ndash; 1.032 million &ndash; was for the orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board propose to, <i>inter alia</i>, recruit an additional two consultant orthodontists, one of whom will be located in Kerry.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the chief executive officer of the SHB that at recent interviews held under the auspices of the Local Appointments Commission &ndash; LAC &ndash; one person was recommended for appointment to the position of consultant orthodontist in the board. This candidate had indicated at interview that his preference was the Cork based post.</P>
    <P>The board is presently arranging with the LAC to re-advertise the consultant post for the Tralee unit in order to expedite an early appointment.</P>

On foot of that review, the Government has decided in the context of the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. A total of 650 of these beds will be in place by the end of 2002. A proposal from the Southern Health Board in relation to the provision of a new 30 bed ward at Tralee General Hospital is being considered in this overall context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments in accordance with Articles 22.3 and 22.4. It is a matter for the board to determine the extent to which it can meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above. A solution has been found to meet the most immediate individual problems and discussions are continuing in an effort to reach agreement on a more long-term approach <Col N="225" /> to the issue. This solution involves the payment of enhanced subventions on quite a significant scale. I am, therefore, somewhat puzzled by the nature of the Deputies' questions.</P>

      <P>Public health doctors have been dealing with problems which have arisen out of hours for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In mid-October the Irish Medical Organisation &ndash; IMO &ndash; wrote to my Department in relation to payments for public health doctors who may have to be called on out of hours in response to alerts relating to biological threats. My Department replied to the IMO advising them that the appropriate statutory body for dealing with such claims is the Health Service Employers' Agency &ndash; HSEA. Subsequently, it was brought to my Department's attention that the IMO had advised public health doctors not to agree to participate in out of hours on-call rosters in the event of a biological incident. My Department again wrote to the IMO requesting it to withdraw with immediate effect their advice to public health <Col N="226" /> doctors and to pursue their claim through normal industrial relations channels. In early November the IMO submitted a claim to the HSEA in this regard and the HSEA is currently processing the claim. I regret however that the IMO has indicated that it will not withdraw its advice until negotiations have been completed.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related services to people with developmental delays, including Johansen/Blizzard Syndrome, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Health boards provide a range of support services in order to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible within the community. A comprehensive community support service includes residential respite care, day care, home support services, including personal assistance services, nursing, therapy, counselling and family support, aids and appliances. Specialised residential care services are also required.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the national physical and sensory disability database development committee, on which the Department, the health research board, the health boards and the voluntary sector are represented, has reported its recommendations on the establishment of a database of service requirements in the sector. When complete, the database will provide information at a national level regarding the levels of investment which will be required and at a local level regarding the specific health service requirements of people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226, to 228, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir (the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages) and for local registrars who operate under his general direction. The General Register Office archive conversion project, which is currently under way in Roscommon, involves the capture of the records of over 150 years of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes. It is estimated that the work will be substantially completed in 2002, which is a necessary prerequisite to the full decentralisation of the General Register Office. The conversion of the archive involves the scanning of the historical records of the office from 1845 to date and the conversion of the associated indexes to an electronic format to be retained on an electronic database.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this is a major and complex undertaking. The second phase of the project, which will take place on completion of the computerisation of the archive, will involve the transfer of the administrative sections of the General Register Office to Roscommon. The cost to date of this work is estimated at £4.65 million, 5.9 million.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware this project is part of a wider plan to modernise the registration service. My Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs have been engaged in the review of the entire registration system, including registration law. The review also examined the structure of registration on a national basis in order to identify the changes needed to capitalise on the use of modern computer technology to capture registration information in an electronic format at the point of registration. The objective is to implement a modern efficient effective and customer focused service geared to the needs of the 21st century. The modernisation of the registration service will benefit all its customers throughout the country by improving the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associated indexes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance of records in a database format provides potential for the development of a <Col N="238" /> range of services, including services through the internet, which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes. The Deputy will appreciate that this will provide a more effective means of accessing records than the production of microfilms or CD Rom, which was referred to in his question. These issues will be addressed in the next stages of the modernisation process. In the interim the modernisation project has received submissions from a number of parties following the launch of its consultation document last May and this consultation process is continuing.</P>
    <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts 1863 to 1996 and the Marriages Acts of 1844 and 1863 provide for the manner in which births, deaths, and marriages may be registered and also for the maintenance of a permanent record of vital events by An t-Ard Chláraitheoir. These Acts also provide for the location of his office, and set out the manner in which the public may access the records and obtain certified copies of individual records. The first stage in the amendment of the registration Acts to facilitate the introduction of the electronic registration of vital events will be effected early in 2002.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make provisions to end the situation whereby householders who purchased their homes with Housing Finance Agency loans are locked into a high interest regime.</Quest>
      <QRef>[29859/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to fixed interest loans issued by local authorities prior to 1988 which carry rates in excess of current levels, I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 85, 93, 95 and 513 of 6 November 2001.</P>
      <P>In relation to the income related loans issued by the Housing Finance Agency, which are issued at variable rather than fixed interest rates, the intention is that the house purchaser's income, and consequently the repayments, will increase in line with inflation and the loan will be repaid in a reasonable time period. This has been the experience in the majority of cases.</P>
      <P>Borrowers are notified each year of their outstanding balance and if it is increasing they are encouraged by the local authority to try to increase their level of repayment. Borrowers with increasing capital balances have the option of either refinancing their loan through a commercial bank or building society or, alternatively, if their income falls as a result of unemployment or short time working, applying for supplementary welfare allowance (SWA). The SWA scheme assists those unemployed or working less than 30 hours a week to cover the interest on their original sum borrowed. The housing finance agency will in these circumstances forego the interest on the difference between the current balance and the original amount borrowed. Under the income related loan scheme the level of redemptions and prepayments are such that the majority of income related loans are being paid off well in advance of maturity.</P>

      <P>Section 45 of the Local Government Act, 2001 confers a statutory right of public attendance at meetings of the full council; at present only the media have such a right. Under these provisions, a local authority's right to meet &ldquo;in committee&rdquo; that is in private is limited to special circumstances and subject to special procedures. In addition, section 54 of the Act allows for the making of regulations by the Minister as regards access by the media and the <Col N="241" /> public to meetings of committees of a local authority.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Local Government Act, 2001 are being brought into operation on a phased basis by way of a series of commencement orders as necessary preparations are completed. The first commencement order was made last month and laid before both Houses. A substantial number of further provisions will be commenced with effect from 1 January 2002 and the necessary commencement order and regulations will be made shortly.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the sections dealing with meetings and proceedings of local authorities will be among a further set of provisions to follow these. They have been scheduled to come into operation by April 2002 so as to allow time for local authorities to adopt new standing orders in accordance with the requirements of the Act. Local authorities have already been informed of this time schedule.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) regulations, 1997, which came into force on 1 October 1997, introduced a number of significant changes in relation to the application of parking laws to disabled persons in Ireland and provided for a new type of disabled persons parking permit.</P>
      <P>The regulations empower local authorities, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association, to grant disabled person's parking permits to a disabled person who is suffering from a disability that prevents that person from walking or causes undue hardship to the person in walking.</P>
      <P>In 1998 my Department agreed to make once-off payments of £5,000 to the Disabled Drivers Association and the Irish Wheelchair Association towards the set-up costs for the issue of the new permits. Requests for additional funding for this service have been made by the two associations.</P>
      <P>While my Department has no funds at its direct disposal for this purpose, the matter will continue to be explored. I have no proposal to change the existing regulatory provisions regarding the disabled persons parking permit scheme.</P>

      <P>The maximum grant payable by a local authority in respect of the adaptation or extension of an existing house to meet the needs of a disabled person is generally up to £16,000, subject to not exceeding 90% of the approved costs of the works. This attracts a two-thirds recoupment from my Department, up to a maximum £10,666, which was introduced in the 2000 budget in respect of work commenced on or after 6 December 2000. The recoupment rate had previously been increased, where work commenced on or after 6 December 1998, from one-half (or £4,000), to two-thirds (or £8,000).</P>
      <P>Under the disabled persons new house adaptation grant, introduced in the 2000 budget, a grant of generally up to £10,000 is available from local authorities to assist disabled persons with the expenditure incurred in making necessary modifications to a new house of less than 12 months old, where works commenced on or after 6 December 2000 and the applicant had not previously obtained a disabled person's new house grant. My Department recoups two-thirds of the grant paid, up to a maximum of £6,666. It is, however, open to local authorities to pay a higher level of grant, subject to not exceeding 90% of the approved cost of the works.</P>

      <P>A proposal for a new waste water treatment plant and collection system for the Curragh, Brownstown, Cutbush and Suncroft areas of County Kildare was included in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Kildare County Council in response to the Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The prioritisation indicated in these lists was taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002, announced in July 2000. Given the priority afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include the above scheme in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> In the meantime, a revised proposal, including details of possible joint funding arrangements between Kildare County Council and the Department of Defence for the Curragh element of the scheme, has been received by my Department from the council. The scheme will be further considered in that light in the context of the next phase of the programme.</P>

It was not, therefore, included in the first phase of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002, announced in July 2000. Following substantial completion of the Kilcullen scheme in autumn 2001 a revised preliminary report for the Athgarvan scheme has been submitted by Kildare County Council and is currently under examination in my Department. Further consideration will be given to the approval of the scheme in the context of the next phase of the water services investment programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 and 243 together.</P>
      <P>Seventy one recycling projects and 11 hazardous waste treatment projects were originally approved for grant aid under the Waste Management Programme of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-1999. Grant approval in respect of two waste recycling projects and one hazardous waste project was subsequently cancelled due to lack of progress on the projects. The surplus funds arising were reallocated to other projects. The projects which received funding are listed in the table below. In accordance with general public accounting requirements, my Department is vigilant in relation to the proper application of all moneys which it disburses. The particular action to be taken in relation to any identified failure in relation to this requirement will depend on the circumstances of the case. Breaches of the conditions of the scheme, involving use of the grant for purposes other than those approved, were discovered in respect of one approved project. A full refund of grant was sought in this case and was repaid.</P>
      <P>One private sector recycling project which received funding under the Operational Programme was taken over by another company at the end of 1999. However, as the recycling activity for which grant aid was provided continued in operation, a refund of grant was not sought.</P>
      <P>In relation to one private sector scheme, full payment of grant has been withheld as my Department was not satisfied that the grant was being properly applied. Litigation was subsequently initiated by the applicant.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware of one company that was grant-aided under the Waste Management Programme and was subsequently dissolved, apparently with effect from 3 March 2000. This case has recently been brought to my Department's attention, and the question of any necessary action arising is currently under consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 246 together.</P>
      <P>Article 5 of the Waste Management (Permit) Regulations, 1998, provides that a local authority may, on application being made to it in that behalf, grant a waste permit, or refuse to grant such a permit, in relation to the carrying on by the applicant of a specified activity at a facility. Where an applicant for a waste permit is a body corporate which is subsequently struck off the companies register it is not evident that there is a basis for the grant or continuation of a permit in the name of that applicant.</P>
      <P>With regard to planning permission, such permission is granted for development of land and attaches to the land in respect of which it is granted rather than to the application for planning permission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Individual planning authorities are primarily responsible for the enforcement of planning control. I consider that strong and visible enforcement is critical to ensure that the planning control system works properly and for the benefit of the whole community. The new simplified and strengthened legislative provisions on enforcement in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, will address a range of issues relevant to enforcement and will include, in particular, a requirement on local authorities to keep complainants updated as enforcement actions proceed.</P>
      <P>Section 255 of the Act introduces new provisions on monitoring the performance of the functions of planning authorities and includes a reserve power for the Minister to appoint a commissioner to perform all or any of the functions of a planning authority which does not carry out its functions in accordance with the requirements of, or under, the Act. I propose to commence the enforcement provisions of the Act, together with the general development control provisions, early in the new year.</P>

The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme, 2000-2002, announced in July 2000.

      <P>I met a delegation from South Dublin County Council on 14 November. The purpose of the meeting, which was at the request of elected members of South Dublin County Council, was to discuss the position in relation to unauthorised Traveller encampments in the area of the authority. The council representatives outlined the difficulties encountered by the authority as a result of the large scale unauthorised encampments by Travellers especially in the Rathfarnham, Lower Dodder and Tallaght areas, and indicated the negative effect that such encampments are having on the implementation of their Traveller accommodation programme.</P>
      <P>In the course of the meeting, I informed the delegation that I was taking the matter up with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I have also asked that the monitoring committee on the implementation of the recommendations of the 1995 task force report on the Travelling community look at the legal powers available to local authorities and others to deal with incidents of unauthorised encampments. The committee, which is under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, comprises representatives of relevant Departments including my Department, Traveller organisations and the social partners. The necessity for any changes in the legislative provisions regarding unauthorised encampments and the issues associated with such encampments will be considered in the light of the committee's consideration and of my consultations with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations, 2001, which replaced earlier 1997 regulations, manufacturers, importers and suppliers of farm plastics are obliged to take steps to recover farm plastics, either through compliance with the regulations directly or by participating in an approved compliance scheme. The Irish farm film producers group, IFFPG, was established in 1997 as an approved industry-led farm <Col N="249" /> film collection and recovery scheme, and includes the company referred to in the Question as a member. The scheme has been an acknowledged success since its commencement and resulted in the collection of an estimated 6,000 tonnes of waste farm plastic for recycling in 2000, representing approximately 40% of the farm plastic placed on the market last year.</P>
      <P>The company referred to has not made any direct submission to my Department regarding the collection of waste farm plastic. However, it has been represented at recent discussions hosted by my Department in relation to the revised corporate governance of the IFFPG.</P>

These are designed, <i>inter alia</i>, to support road safety. The requirements do not include the fitting of safety frames to any of the vehicles in question and under EU law member sates are not free to introduce requirements additional to those in the directive. While the above directive will soon be replaced, I understand that the new EU regime will still not provide for mandatory fitting of safety frames to these vehicles. The directive does not apply to machines intended for agricultural or similar purposes.</P>
      <P>I understand that a leaflet that deals with the safe use of all-terrain vehicles in agriculture and forestry has been prepared by the Health and Safety Authority. Among the topics to be covered in the leaflet are training in the safe use of the machines and advice on roll-over protection and seatbelts.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, the relevant provisions of which commenced on 1 January 2001, now requires that planning authorities in the greater Dublin area have regard to the strategic planning guidelines when making and adopting a development plan. In accordance with its role as statutory consultee for development plans, my Department examined the draft development plan for County Meath which had been prepared during 2000 and wrote to the council in December 2000 raising a number of issues of concern in relation to compliance with the guidelines. Meath County Coun<Col N="251" /> cil subsequently replied to the Department in February 2001 indicating that it would make a number of amendments to the draft development plan to bring it into line with the guidelines. My Department subsequently informed the council that its response clarified the substantive issues raised by the Department and that the amendments proposed were substantially in compliance with the strategic planning guidelines. The Meath county development plan has since been adopted.</P>

      <P>The essential repairs grant scheme is operated by local authorities in accordance with statutory regulations which are designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to the authorities. It is a matter for each local authority to decide the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in their area from within overall allocations by my Department for house purchase and improvement loans, disabled persons and essential repairs grants. It is also a matter for local authorities to assess the circumstances of each individual applicant, to decide what works <Col N="252" /> are necessary to prolong the useful life of the house for the occupants, to determine the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid.</P>
      <P>The total amount recouped by my Department to local authorities under the scheme has increased from £0.691 million, or 0.877 million, in 1997 to £2.148 million, or 2.727 million, in 2000 and to £2.331 million, or 2.960 million, for the first nine months of this year. I have also substantially improved the terms of the grant, increasing the effective maximum grant from £1,800 or 2,286 prior to 2 December 1998 to £7,500 or 9,523 currently and I also increased the maximum percentage recoupment payable by my Department from 50% to two-thirds of the amount of the grant paid by the local authority. The increase in the effective maximum grant has allowed local authorities greater flexibility in relation to the type of works which may be carried out under the scheme. My Department is currently updating guidelines for local authorities on the scheme, which will consolidate previous guidance in relation to its administration.</P>

      <P>However, without prejudice to this position, I have requested from SIPTU at a meeting on 25 July 2001 a submission categorising cases of specific hardship which may not be fully covered by the current mitigation measures; this submission is still awaited. I am also aware of representations from FAIR and I have suggested to FAIR that they may wish to communicate with SIPTU in relation to their concerns on this matter or make a separate submission to my Department. I am also meeting with representatives from FAIR on 29 November 2001. Pending the receipt and examination of the details which have been requested from the representative groups, I am not in a position to indicate further mitigation measures.</P>

Recent regulations prescribe 30 November 2001 for the purposes of commencing the operation of these proceedings and, among other things, set out procedures for the making of permit applications, public consultation and the grant, refusal and review of permits by local authorities.</P>
      <P>Thirty one local authorities in seven regional groups have nominated a single permitting authority in respect of each region. In addition, three individual local authorities will implement the permitting system solely in respect of their own functional areas. Accordingly, a waste collection business operating nationally will require a maximum of ten waste collection permits from the relevant local authorities.</P>
      <P>A list of those local authorities that are permitting authorities for the purpose of the 2001 regulations is set out in the following schedule.

      <P>Section 5 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, and Article 36 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, contain provisions governing the availability of documents relating to planning applications. Under these provisions, where a planning application is received, the planning authority must make available for inspection the application concerned and any drawings, maps, particulars, evidence, environmental impact statement, other written study or further information received or obtained from the applicant in accordance with regulations under the Planning Acts. This material must be available during office hours, at the offices of the planning authority, from as soon as the application is received until the decision on the application is made or the application is withdrawn.</P>
      <P>In addition, a copy of any submissions or observations made in writing received by the planning authority in relation to the planning application must be made available for inspection by the public from as soon as may be after the receipt of the submissions or observations, for a period of one month after the date of the decision on the application or until the application is withdrawn.</P>
      <P>If an appeal is taken against the decision of the planning authority on a planning application, or against conditions attached to a permission, the submissions and observations must remain available for inspection until An Bord Pleanála has made a decision on the appeal, given directions in relation to the appeal against conditions or until the appeal is withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Where a decision on a planning application is made, the following documents should be made available for inspection at the offices of the planning authority, during office hours, for a period of five years from the date of the decision: a copy of the planning application and any drawings, maps, particulars, evidence, environmental impact statement, other written study or further information received or obtained by them in accordance with regulations under the Planning Acts; a copy of any report prepared by or for the planning authority in relation to the planning application; a copy of the decision of the planning authority in respect of the planning application and a copy of the notification of the decision given to the applicant; and a copy of any submissions or observations made in writing received by a planning authority in relation to the planning application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each planning authority is also required to make available for purchase, at a fee not exceeding the reasonable cost of making the copy, any environmental impact statement which accompanies a planning application. There is no statutory obligation on planning authorities to make copies of other planning documents avail<Col N="257" /> able for purchase under the current planning regulations. However, my Department issued circular letters on 11 April 1995 and on 9 January 1996 to each planning authority requesting them to put arrangements in place to make copies of planning documents available to the public for a fee not exceeding the reasonable cost of making the copy.</P>
    <P>Section 38 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, now provides that all copies of documents available for inspection by the public in relation to a planning application will also be available for purchase, on payment of a fee not exceeding the reasonable cost of making the copy. This provision will be brought into force with the commencement of the development control provisions of the Act, for which draft regulations are being finalised at present.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SWA is subject to a means test. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the household, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circum<Col N="258" /> stances, less £6, 7.62. This £6, 7.62, represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Most recipients pay more than £6, 7.62, towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent.</P>
    <P>In cases where maintenance payments are made, the first £75 per week of maintenance is regarded as being towards housing costs. One result is that a person in receipt of one parent family payment or OFP can receive up to a maximum of £75 per week maintenance for mortgage-rental costs without affecting the rate of OFP payable. Another consequence is that their housing costs for rent supplement purposes are the total amount of rent less maintenance payments of up to £75 per week. Prior to the last budget, any additional maintenance over and above £75 per week would reduce the amount of OFP payable on a £1 for £1 basis. Following the budget, recipients are now allowed to retain 50% of any maintenance received over and above the £75 allowed in respect of mortgage/rental costs. The rate of OFP is now only reduced by 50p per £1 in such cases, instead of the £1 for £1 reduction that previously applied.</P>
    <P>Consequently, a higher rate of OFP is paid than has been the case up to now and this would ordinarily lead to a reduction in the rate of rent supplement payable to a person in this situation. In order to address the position relating to the £1 for £1 clawback of rent supplement I introduced a new disregard in the means test for rent supplement. A disregard of up to £25 can be allowed in respect of any increase in OFP payments arising from this change in the assessment of maintenance in the OFP means test.</P>
    <P>I recognise that these arrangements are complex but, unfortunately, this is necessarily so given the complexity of situations in which maintenance payments are made. However, the means test calculation for rent and mortgage interest supplement will be examined as part of the review of the SWA scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. Any proposals for changes in this area would have to be considered in a budgetary context. As the Deputy will appreciate I cannot, at this point, give specific details of any proposed changes in this area in the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>A person who has been laid off is entitled to unemployment payments provided he or she is fully unemployed for at least three days in any period of six consecutive days.</P>
      <P>The conditions for receipt of unemployment payments require,<i> inter alia</i>, that a person must be available for employment and genuinely seeking work. In order to satisfy these conditions a person must demonstrate that he or she is making reasonable efforts to secure suitable, full-time employment or self-employment. Clearly, however, an unemployed person would be expected to take up other part-time work if that is available for the days on which they are unemployed.</P>
      <P>All unemployed persons, including part-time workers, who are in receipt of an unemployment payment, are given a reasonable period of time in which to look for suitable full-time employment, following which their claims may be subject to review to see if they continue to satisfy the qualifying conditions for receipt of payment.</P>
      <P>There has been no change in policy in relation to the entitlement of unemployed persons, including those employed on a part-time basis, to unemployment benefit and assistance during periods of unemployment. Where a person is dissatisfied with the decision to refuse him or her an unemployment payment he or she may appeal this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to individual claims must be made by deciding officers and appeal officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>There has been no change in the way income from home help employment is treated for the purpose of determining entitlement to a qualified adult allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that regulations provide for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance or QAA for claimants of certain welfare payments where the spouse or partner of the claimant is earning between £70, 88.88 and £145, 184.11, per week. The level of qualified adult allowance varies from one payment to another. So, in order to phase out the payment over the same income range for all payments, the withdrawal rates vary with the level of qualified adult allowance. The QAA is withdrawn when the <Col N="261" /> spouse or partner's weekly income exceeds £145, 184.11. These arrangements apply to income from all sources, including earnings from employment in the home help service.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that agreement was reached on a revised overall pay structure for home helps in return for a restructured and enhanced home help service, following the conclusion of Labour Court negotiations in June 2000. The agreement provided for the alignment of hourly home help pay rates with the pay rates of other non-nursing health service employees, the payment of travel expenses, premia payments for Saturday-Sunday working and full annual leave entitlement as set out in the part-time workers agreement in the health service.</P>
    <P>The revised pay rates were awarded on a phased basis of 75% from 1 January 2000, 85% from 1 July 2000 and the full rate from 1 January 2001. Accordingly, home helps now have full employee status similar to all other health service employees.</P>
    <P>In light of these developments, the provision of an income disregard of earnings from employment in the home help service would give rise to certain equity implications as regards the application of the qualified adult allowance arrangements. For example, those with similar levels of earnings, including non-nursing staff in other areas of the health service, would not be entitled to such a disregard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The correspondence in question relates to the assessment of a spouse's earnings for disability allowance or DA purposes. As in the case of all other social assistance payments, DA is subject to a means test. For the purposes of assessing means, account is taken of the claimant's own means and, in the case of a couple, the joint means are assessed.</P>
      <P>Where the spouse of a claimant to DA has earnings, this can have two separate consequences for the claimant's entitlement to payment. First, a spouse's earnings may affect the claimant's entitlement to the qualified adult allowance. Second, depending on the level of the spouse's earnings, this may affect the claimant's personal entitlement.</P>
      <P>A qualified adult allowance is payable in addition to the personal rate of payment in respect of a spouse who is being wholly or mainly maintained by the claimant. In general, a spouse is not regarded as being wholly or mainly maintained by the claimant where they are in receipt of a social welfare payment in their own right or have income in excess of £70, 88.88, a week. However, where a spouse's weekly income is between £70, 88.88, and £145, 184.11, a reduced qualified adult allowance is paid. These amounts are kept under review.</P>
      <P>The second consequence of spousal earnings is on the claimant's own entitlement to payment. In assessing the spouse's means for DA purposes, account is taken of the spouse's net earnings, that is earnings net of income tax, PRSI, health insurance contributions, superannuation and union dues. A certain amount of the spouse's earnings from employment is disregarded &ndash; £70, 88.88 where they are working 4 days or more, £30, 38.09, where they are working between one and three days. Half of the spouse's net income is then assessed as means.</P>
      <P>Any relaxation of the means test along the lines being suggested in the correspondence referred to would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources and having regard to the Government's other priorities. It would also raise equity issues <i>vis-à-vis</i> other recipients, e.g., it would be difficult to justify disregarding spouse's income in cases of disability allowance and not doing so in the case of other social assistance payments.  </P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for carer's allowance on 24 August. One of the principal conditions for receipt of the allowance is that full-time care and attention is required and being provided to the care recipient. The application was refused as this condition was not satisfied. The person concerned was notified of this decision on 31 October and of her right to appeal. Her case has been forwarded to the social welfare appeals office for determination. The appeals office will be in direct contact with the person concerned in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Christmas bonus has been paid at a rate equivalent to 70% of a person's normal weekly payment, subject to a minimum payment of £20 or 25.39 since 1989. In 2000 it was increased to 100% or double the person's normal weekly payment, again subject to a minimum payment of £20 or 25.39 and will be paid on a similar basis in 2001. The cost of this measure is estimated to be £79.1 million or 100.4 million. Payment will be made in early December and it is estimated that it will benefit some 1.2 million persons comprising some 780,000 recipients and an estimated 400,000 dependants.</P>
      <P>The bonus will be paid to recipients of long-term payments including disablement pension, death benefit by way of pension, old age contributory and non-contributory pensions, retirement pension, invalidity pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, widow's and widower's contributory pension, orphan's contributory and non-contributory pensions, pre-retirement allowance, blind pension, carer's allowance, one parent family payment, payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, farm assist and the disability allowance.</P>
      <P>The focus of the Christmas bonus is firmly based on long-term welfare payment recipients and any proposal to extend the bonus to persons in receipt of disability benefit would be inconsistent with this basic objective, and would create inevitable pressures for its further extension to other short-term categories in the future.</P>
      <P>It is already open to persons who have been in receipt of disability benefit for at least a year to be assessed for invalidity pension and if found eligible for same, to qualify for the Christmas bonus payment.</P>

      <P>There are a number of sites, covering both the built and natural heritage, in and around the Tralee area that are of interest to my Department. I have listed them under the following headings. If the Deputy has a particular interest in any of the sites listed I will be happy <Col N="267" /> to supply him with more detailed information on them. They are as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>National Monuments</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Ardfert Cathedral lies just north of Tralee town has undergone a major programme of conservation and restoration to the Nave.</P>
      <P>Ardfert Friary was founded probably in 1253 for the Franciscans. The tower was turned into a barracks in Elizabethan times but was later taken over by the Protestant bishop for religious use.</P>
      <P>Rathass Church is located in the grounds of an old cemetery in Tralee. It contains a number of interesting features among them the flat headed west doorway and the round headed window in the east wall with its Romanesque moulding.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Architectural Inventory</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Under the provisions of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999, a nationwide survey is currently being carried out by my Department to help identify structures and buildings which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest. A draft survey covering Tralee will be completed next year. This will inform my recommendations to Tralee Urban District Council relating to the inclusion of individual structures in the record of protected structures.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Record of Monuments and Places in County Kerry</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>A record of monuments and places, a RMP, has been established under section 12 of the National Monuments (amendment) Act, 1994, in respect of all known archaeological sites and monuments. Under the RMP the historic core of Tralee is listed as an area of archaeological potential. In addition, there are a large number sites and monuments within the historic core of Tralee which are also included in the RMP and are thus indicative of the rich archaeological heritage of the area.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Nature Reserves in County Kerry</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>There are a total of 15 nature reserves in County Kerry. Two of them, Tralee Bay and Derrymore island, are geographically close to Tralee.</P>
      <P>Tralee Bay comprises of 754.53 hectares and is situated on the north side of the Dingle Peninsula and west of Tralee. It is of international importance for waterfowl especially the wintering populations of Brent geese that it supports. It was established on l6 May l989 and is State owned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Derrymore Island comprises of l06.07 hectares and is situated in Tralee Bay. It is a compound spit composed of a series of pebble beaches, one of the best spits in Ireland. It sup<Col N="268" /> ports many rare plant communities mainly of a salt marsh type. Wigeon and brent geese graze the salt marsh on the eastern side of the spit. The white top of the spit is an important high tide roosting area for shore birds. It was established l6 May l989 and is privately owned. It is managed in agreement with my Department.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sites proposed for designation under the EU Habitats Directive</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The following sites in the vicinity of Tralee, which are of ecological importance, have been proposed for designation under the EU Habitats Directive:</P>
    <P>Ballyseedy Wood cSAC (Site Code 2112) lies south of the River Lee, some 2 km south-east of Tralee, County Kerry. The wood is of prime importance for its Alder-Ash dominated woodland stands, a habitat that is rare and threatened in Europe and listed, with priority status, on Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive. The site is also of significance for the several rare or scarce plant species that occur.</P>
    <P>Tralee Bay and Magharees Peninsula cSAC (Site Code 2070) is of considerable ecological and conservation significance for the excellent diversity of habitats it contains, including fixed dune and lagoon. The presence of a number of Red Data Book species includes the largest population of Natterjack Toads in Ireland. The site includes two statutory nature reserves, Tralee Bay and Derrymore Island, and much of the estuarine part of the site has been designated an SPA under the Birds Directive.</P>
    <P>Slieve Mish cSAC (Site Code 2185) is a large site to the south of the town. The site contains a good population of Killarney Fern, a species that is listed on Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive. Two other plants that are also listed in the Irish Red Data Book occur, namely Betony and Cornish Moneywort. Peregrines breed on cliffs within the site and Chough are known to feed in the area. Both of these species are listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cultural Development Incentives Scheme 1999-2000</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>

      <P>The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and I, as a member of the Executive, am precluded from intervening directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can inform the Deputy that the Bail Act, 1997, has two main purposes. The first is con<Col N="271" /> tained mainly in sections 2 to 4, inclusive, which, in line with the constitutional referendum of 1996, set out that for certain serious offences bail may be refused if the court is satisfied that it is &ldquo;reasonably considered necessary&rdquo; to prevent the commission of a serious offence by the accused. The remaining sections were designed to tighten up the bail regime in general and apply it to all offences, not just those scheduled as serious offences within the meaning of the Act.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, provides in section 4 for the creation of a new offence related to the possession of drugs with a value of £10,000 or more for the purpose of sale or supply. It provides in section 5 that the court shall, in imposing sentence, specify a minimum period of imprisonment to be served of not less than ten years upon conviction for the offence. Section 5 also provides that a court is entitled to depart from the imposition of the minimum sentence where there are exceptional and specific circumstances relating to the offence or the person convicted of the offence which would make it unjust in all the circumstances to impose the minimum ten year sentence. Factors to which the court may have regard in this respect include whether the person pleaded guilty and, if so, the stage at which the person indicated the intention to plead guilty and the circumstances in which the indication was given, and whether the person materially assisted the investigation of the offence.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, is being kept under review by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with its terms of reference, the Commission on Liquor Licensing presented an interim report on off-licensing to me <Col N="273" /> in April last. It contains a set of recommendations relating to dormant licences, under-age drinking, access to off-licences and certain related matters. I subsequently obtained Government approval to publish the interim report.</P>
      <P>By way of response to the commission's recommendations relating to improved access to off-licences, the Government noted my intention to bring forward proposals for amending legislation at the earliest opportunity. The preparatory work on this new legislation is at an early stage in my Department. Framing this new legislation is not a simple task, however, given the complexity of existing legislation in this area which the commission itself has acknowledged. For this reason, I am unable to say when proposals for legislation will be ready for publication.</P>
      <P>As regards the recommendations not relating to access to off-licences &ndash; the majority of which fall within the areas of responsibility of other Departments and agencies &ndash; the Government agreed that a co-ordinated response be developed by a high-level, interdepartmental working group of the Departments and agencies concerned. This working group presented its report at the end of June. I am happy to say that the Departments and agencies concerned responded in a broadly positive and constructive way to the commission's recommendations and indicated that they would be taking appropriate action to address them in due course. I understand that such action is under way at present. For example, within my own Department, I have established a review group to examine the current age card scheme and to make appropriate recommendations. I expect that it will report to me by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>To underline the importance it attaches to the work of the commission, the Government has requested the working group to present a progress report on all actions taken by Departments and agencies in response to the interim report's recommendations by 31 January 2002.</P>
      <P>The Government has also requested the Commission on Liquor Licensing to submit additional interim reports on issues which can be progressed in advance of the commission's final report at the end of 2002. I am pleased to say that the commission has responded positively to this request. However, I understand that the commission is unable to say at present when further interim reports are likely to be ready for submission.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that security screens were fitted to a number of cars in the past but for a variety of reasons, particularly health and safety considerations, were found unsuitable. In order to get the proper level of protection, a car must have its rear seats removed and an integral unit, comprising of screen and rear plastic seat, fitted. This restricts the space in the rear of the car and during trials was rejected as unsuitable by Garda members.</P>
      <P>I am also advised by the Garda authorities that present policy is to transport violent persons to stations by use of public order vehicles with a cell unit fitted in the saloon of the vehicle. The cell units are fitted to a number of vehicles particularly in the larger population areas and Garda policy is to have at least one of these vehicles available to every Garda district in the country. This gives total security and protection to Garda members and allows the prisoners a degree of freedom of movement. The cell units comply with all health and safety requirements whilst at the same affording Garda personnel the necessary level of protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have received one complaint of assault in the vicinity of St. Brendan's Park in recent weeks. This occurred on 11 November 2001, at 1.30 a.m. in a cul-de-sac opposite St. Brendan's church. A 58 year old man was <Col N="276" /> assaulted by two youths and received minor injuries. The Garda investigation is ongoing.</P>
      <P>In relation to other offences, I am further informed that, over the past two years, four burglaries have been recorded in St. Brendan's Park. I understand that one of these has been solved and that a suspect has been identified in respect of another. There were three recorded cases of minor criminal damage to vehicles in the park, for which no person has been made amenable. There has been one detection for public order offences in the park.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the disused north Kerry railway line is used as a walkway by many local residents. It is also occasionally used for anti-social behaviour and by local criminal elements. As a result, it and adjoining residential areas receive dedicated policing by uniform and plain clothes units resulting in illicit activities being considerably curtailed. I also understand that, in recent years, the local authority has built a boundary wall between the Abbeydorney Road and the entrance to the rail line, inhibiting entry onto the line from the main thoroughfare.</P>
      <P>A successful community policing scheme operates in the Cois Coille, Shanakill, Rahoonane and Gallowsfield housing estates. Gallowsfield is adjacent to St. Brendan's Park, which has a neighbourhood watch scheme. Earlier this year, I approved the expansion of the &ldquo;Connect 7&rdquo; Garda youth diversion project to cover Shanakill, Rathoonane, Gallowsfield, Cois Coilte and Muing. This involves an increase in funding from £50,000 in 2000 to a sum of £80,000 in 2001 and thereafter. I am informed that the project has been well received by the local communities to date.</P>

    <P>The RIA has recently entered into a short-term contract with the owners of Glenvera Hotel, Wellington Road, Cork city, for the provision of full board accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers from 10 December 2001. It is envisaged that up to 100 asylum seekers, mainly couples, will be accommodated when the hotel is fully operational. In bringing it on stream, the agency will adopt a sensitive approach to making placements and numbers will be built up on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>In accordance with Government policy, the RIA is assessing the potential of accommodation offers in all regions throughout the State on an ongoing basis. In line with normal practice I do not propose to release details of these properties until such time as the arrangements in relation to them have been agreed and all relevant formalities concluded.</P>

    <P>It must be noted that there are over 200 public service bodies, varying in size and diversity of jobs and the range of work involved. Public service bodies have staff levels ranging from one to 10,000 employees.</P>
    <P>It must also be noted that some bodies have exceeded the target &ndash; the highest performer achieved a level of 5%. However, it is recognised that there are other bodies who have performed poorly. The government is committed to ensuring equal opportunities for people with disabilities in the areas of training and employment and has taken a strategic approach to policy development involving both legislative and positive action measures to achieve this end.</P>
    <P>I recognise that, overall, the level of progress with regard to the target has been unacceptably slow. This must now be addressed urgently. I am, therefore, giving serious consideration to measures to ensure progress in this area, including a possible legislative option. In the meantime, the monitoring committee, chaired by my Department, will continue to monitor progress and guide support.</P>
    <P>Under a Government commitment in the PPF, every Department is required to take appropriate action to ensure that agencies under its aegis achieve the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service at an early date. In order to answer the statistical information sought by the Deputy, I have secured relevant information from the Ministers for Finance, Health and Children and the Environment and Local Government and appended it as follows in tabular form. The Government established a monitoring committee which is chaired by my Department to monitor and guide progress towards achievement of this target in the public service has supported a number of initiatives over the last two years including: approval of a draft code of practice for use in the public service and exploration of the options for common selection procedures for people with disabilities; raising awareness of the 3% target among, and giving <Col N="280" /> information to, chief executives, personnel officers and disability equality officers in the public service through a series of eight regional seminars, and publication of an information brochure; and publication of a brochure designed to encourage people with disabilities to consider a career in the public service and promotion of this at the Public Sector Careers Expo in April 2001.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee commissioned research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations, the report of which the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, launched on Thursday, 22 November last. This report provides an insight into some of the issues which hinder progress and includes recommendations to assist future progress. Copies of the report are being circulated to all public sector employers to inform their future strategies.</P>
    <P>While analysing progress on the target, I believe that account must be taken of one of the most significant developments to date &ndash; that is the introduction of mainstreaming disability policy which was launched by an Taoiseach in June 2000. This policy requires that public service bodies which provide services for the public are the same bodies that provide services for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>As a result, employment and vocational training policies for people with disabilities are now formulated as part of general labour market policy underlining the move from a medical view of disability to an inclusive economic and social view of disability. The mainstreaming process is still in the early stages and service providers, employers, clients and employees are adapting to the new arrangements that were put in place formally in June 2000 and which are developing in response to the new policy.</P>

    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance is responsible for the 3% target of employment of people with disabilities within the Civil Service. I understand that the 3% target has been effective in creating additional employment opportunities for people with disabilities in Departments.</P>
    <P>The number of people with a disability employed in the Civil Service increased during the 1990s. The 3% target was achieved for the three years between 1993 and 1995. It is estimated that the percentage fell from 2.9% in 1996 and 1997 to 2.6% in 2000. These figures also reflect a more specific recording of employees with a disability to ensure that short-term disabilities are not included in the figures. I am satisfied that these reflect a more accurate position regarding the employment of people with disabilities in the public sector than the broader definitions of disability contained in earlier statistics</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission held a special clerical officer competition between November 1999 and January 2000 for people registered with the former National Rehabilitation Board with the subsequent interviews taking place in the spring to early summer 2000. The successful candidates were placed on a panel. To date over 130 assignments have been made from this panel, with some 20 candidates awaiting assignment, while the remainder are awaiting clearance from the chief medical officer.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance, which is responsible for the operation of the 3% target within the <Col N="282" /> Civil Service, is considering what steps need to be taken to improve the percentage of people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service. I understand that that Department is planning an initiative which will re-emphasise the importance of the policy to all other Departments.</P>
    <P>As part of this policy review, research is being carried out into the career progression of people with disabilities in Departments which will result in specific recommendations to improve the position of people with disabilities in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The employment of people with disabilities in the public and civil sector is kept under continuing review as this Government is determined to see more people with disabilities able to avail of jobs in Departments, bodies and agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a child under the age 16 is removed from the State in breach of a parent's guardianship rights by a parent of that child, the left-behind parent can make an application under the Hague Convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction or under the European convention on recognition and enforcement of decisions concerning custody of children and on restoration of custody of children, known as the Luxembourg Convention. The purpose of the conventions is to facilitate the <Col N="283" /> return of children who have been taken from one contracting state to another against the wishes of a parent with guardianship rights. In addition, there is provision under the Luxembourg Convention for a custody or access order granted in one contracting state to be recognised or enforced in another contracting state. The Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991, gives the force of law in Ireland to these conventions. There is a network of central authorities established under the conventions for the purposes of assisting applicants and generally ensuring the effective operation of the conventions. My Department operates as the central authority for Ireland.</P>
      <P>Where a child has been removed from the State in the circumstances already described, the Irish central authority can help the left-behind parent to avail of the provisions of the conventions by: assisting with the completion of an application form; arranging for a translation if necessary; transmitting the application to the corresponding foreign central authority; and monitoring the progress of the application.</P>
      <P>The role of the central authority for the jurisdiction to where the child has been removed is to attempt to discover the whereabouts of the child and secure the return of the child either voluntarily or by initiating court proceedings in that jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The Irish Central Authority provides its services free of charge. It can be contacted by telephone at (01) 663 2656 or 2650.</P>
      <P>Parental child abduction is an offence under section 16 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997. This section applies to a parent, guardian or a person to whom custody of the child has been granted by a court but does not apply to a parent who is not a guardian of the child. It provides that it is an offence for a person to send or keep a child under the age of 16 years out of the State or cause a child under that age to be so taken, sent or kept: in defiance of a court order; or without the consent of each person who is a parent, or guardian or person to whom custody of the child has been granted by a court unless the consent of a court was obtained.</P>
      <P>A parent who is not the guardian of a child is guilty of an offence under section 17 of the 1997 Act if he takes or removes a child from the lawful control of a person.</P>
      <P>A person found guilty of an offence under either section is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or to both.</P>
      <P>It is open to a person who considers that an offence under either section has been committed to report the matter to the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Waterford was refused the special rate of maintenance for 2000/2001; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[29522/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of <Col N="286" /> conditions, one of which is that she or he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses: (a) the higher education grants scheme; (b) the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; (c) the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; (d) maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, she or he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain <Col N="287" /> on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

    <P>It is not feasible to provide customised question papers on an individual candidate basis having regard to the particular mother tongue.

This policy must also apply in this case.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that to provide a translation in any one language would require the creation of a capacity to respond in any world language and to the translation standard essential to ensuring that all technical terms are properly converted. As far as my Department is aware such a facility is not provided in other comparable jurisdictions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has presided over an unprecedented level of development in special education services. In October 1998 the Government decided that all children with special needs in primary schools should have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs irrespective of their level of need or location. As a result of this decision, the number of resource teachers in place in primary schools has been increased from 104 to more than 1,000. The number of special needs assistants in the system has been increased from less than 300 to more than 2,500 over the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1999 the learning support teacher service was extended to every first and second level school in the country with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or more. At present, there are 1,485 learning support teachers in place in primary schools and a further 560 in place at second <Col N="295" /> level. In addition, since 1999 all special schools and special classes dedicated to children with disabilities have been operating at the special reduced pupil teacher ratios recommended by the special education review committee.</P>
    <P>The nature and level of the special education service provided in each case is based on the assessed needs of the individual child. The availability of professional assessment services is, therefore, of crucial importance in accessing special education services. The national educational psychological service, NEPS, which was established in 1999, has responsibility for providing assessment services. At the time of its establishment, the development plan for NEPS envisaged that it would achieve nationwide coverage by the end of 2004. However, in July of this year the Government approved my proposals for the accelerated development of NEPS with a view to its achieving nationwide coverage by the end of next year. This decision was taken to facilitate more ready access to assessment services for children with special needs. I have also made funding of £1.25 million available in the current year to facilitate the engagement of private educational psychologists to conduct assessments where NEPS is not in a position to deliver such services on a timely basis.</P>
    <P>In addition to the substantial increase in support services outlined above, the Government has approved my proposals for the establishment of a national council for special education. The council will be charged with providing research and expert advice and carrying out certain operational functions in relation to services for children with disabilities. Work is also proceeding in my Department on the preparation of legislation which will put in place a comprehensive structure to ensure, as far as practicable, that the educational needs of children and young people with disabilities are met in a comprehensive and timely fashion. The measures I have outlined will ensure that all persons with disabilities will have access to the services they require when and where they require them.</P>
    <P>At third level, my Department administers the special fund for students with disabilities. This fund, which is ESF aided, provides grants towards the provision of services and the purchase of equipment for students with disabilities attending courses in third level institutions or post-leaving certificate courses. There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period 2000 to 2006, which is aimed at tackling under-representation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities in third level education.</P>
    <P>Last July I launched the report of the action group on access to third level education, which I set up to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation by the three target groups. Many of the report's recommendations are aimed at improving access of <Col N="296" /> students with disabilities to third level education and I am committed to progressing implementation of the group's recommendations as resources permit.</P>

      <P>There have been some difficulties in responding to the volume of requests for individual psychological assessments in the north-western region of the national educational psychological service, NEPS. However, earlier this year I announced the allocation of extra funding to NEPS to enable schools to commission assessments from private practitioners. This is a short-term measure, pending the further expansion of the psychological service.</P>
      <P>NEPS has issued guidelines for this scheme to all schools. A letter has also recently been sent to Carndonagh community school, advising it that it may avail of the scheme. The school may, therefore, arrange an assessment privately for the student named by the Deputy. NEPS will arrange payment for the assessment, within the parameters laid down in the guidelines.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, based on the current staffing schedule, St. Seachnaill's will qualify for an additional mainstream teacher on 1 September 2002.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, which is reviewed annually following discussions with the education partners. This schedule may only be deviated from in exceptional cases and in the case of schools with developing school status. The criteria to qualify for a post under developing school status are outlined in Circular 12/01. This circular was issued to all boards of management earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The enrolment in the school referred to by the Deputy was 322 pupils on 30 September 2000 which warrants a staffing of principal plus 11 mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. Unfortunately, the school's current enrolment does not qualify it for an additional mainstream class teacher on developing school status for this school year.</P>

      <P>Officials in my Department are consulting with the County Monaghan Vocational Educational Committee with a view towards determining the accommodation requirements at Castleblayney college. My Department is aware of the condition of the old building and, to that end, a previous extension was built on the main campus to remove the necessity to use that building. A subsequent increase in enrolments by the school, however, has meant that this building has continued to be occupied. A senior inspector will visit the school shortly to finalise the accommodation to be provided in the form of a further extension, and to identify the school's short-term requirements. After he has done so, architectural planning of the new extension may commence.</P>
      <P>In relation to the matter of student safety when crossing the main road, this is a supervisory issue for the school authorities in the first instance. The Department has advised County Monaghan VEC to liaise with the Garda Síochána and the local authority with a view towards devising a plan which will minimise any risk to the safety of the student population.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy forms part of a comprehensive range of proposals which have been put forward by a special planning group which was established to consider the development of a national centre of excellence for the visually impaired. The proposals brought forward by the planning group envisage the development of a national centre of excellence at Drumcondra, Dublin. The national centre would deliver a comprehensive range of professional support services for the visually impaired from pre-school level to young adulthood. The services in question would be available to all pupils on the Drumcondra campus and on an Outreach basis to students with visual impairment throughout the country. The proposals also envisage the development at Drumcondra of a full range of educational support services for visually impaired girls of first and second level age.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to ensuring that adequate educational support services are made available to all students with visual impairment. My commitment in this regard is reflected in the fact that I secured additional funding of £500,000 in the current year to facilitate the appointment of additional staff at the existing schools for the visually impaired at Drumcondra. However, the Deputy will appreciate that the recommendations brought forward by the planning group, including those relating to the development of services for visually impaired girls, involve a range of complex issues which require careful evaluation. As part of this process, my Department will shortly be appointing a project management team to undertake a detailed feasibility study of the existing facilities at Drumcondra and the likely cost factors involved in the proposed development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants. The action group considered the target group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that she or he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants. My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses &ndash; the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, she or he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, <Col N="306" /> been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be regularly reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended, provides relief from income tax, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved third level courses in approved colleges. The relief applies,<i> inter alia</i>, to approved part-time undergraduate courses of a minimum duration of two years at colleges approved for the higher education grant scheme and to approved full-time and part-time courses of a minimum duration of two years in private third level colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, courses in colleges under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority are approved for tax-relief purposes by the Higher Education Authority. Courses in the Institutes of Technology and private colleges are, generally speaking, submitted for approval to the Higher Education and Training Awards Council. Tax relief is currently available for outlay on nationally certified third-level courses and certain information technology and language courses conducted by FÁS. The White Paper on adult education, Learning for Life, recommended that a working group be established to explore and cost the feasibility of extending tax relief to all participants on nationally certified adult learning programmes, irrespective of their location, duration or level and of treating all investment in <Col N="307" /> human capital by employers on the same basis for taxation purposes as other capital investment.</P>
    <P>There are over 80 recommendations in the White Paper, which sets out a comprehensive and long-term strategy for the future development of the adult education sector. These recommendations will be implemented on a phased basis as resources and staffing levels permit. This particular recommendation will be pursued in due course in collaboration with the Revenue Commissioners. Any amendment to the tax relief provisions in respect of third level tuition fees, is of course, a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>

      <P>The subject matter of the correspondence related to the payment of a teacher at the untrained rate of pay. To qualify for the trained rate of pay for service in a temporary capacity in a primary school, a person requires either a primary or secondary teaching qualification. A primary teaching qualification can be obtained by a person undertaking a recognised primary teaching training course and gaining a recognised primary teaching qualification. Such a qualification is usually achieved by a person graduating from one of the recognised teacher training courses in the colleges of education, including the postgraduate conversion courses.</P>
      <P>Secondary trained teachers, that is, persons holding a recognised primary degree together with a higher diploma in education, which would normally entitle an individual to teach at post-primary level, are also entitled to be remunerated at the trained rate of pay for work in a temporary capacity in a primary school.</P>
      <P>As the person in question does not possess either of the above qualifications she is therefore only entitled to the untrained rate of pay.</P>
