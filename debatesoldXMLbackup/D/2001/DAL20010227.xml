      <Quest>if the positions of third legal assistant and fourth legal assistant in the Office of the Attorney General as advertised in a publication (details supplied) on 21 July 2000 have been filled; if not, the vacancies which currently remain; if and when these positions have again been advertised; the current vacancies in the Attorney General's office; and the qualifications that applicants for current vacant positions must fulfil.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Attorney General's office comprises both professional and administrative staff. On the professional side, the position is as follows. At the time of the advertisement on 21 July 2000 there were two vacancies for third legal assistant and seven vacancies for fourth legal assistant. As a result of the competition, one vacancy at third legal assistant level was filled and the other vacancy at this level was filled by promotion internally. Three of the vacancies at fourth legal assistant level were filled by way of the July 2000 competition.</P>
      <P>There are no vacancies for the grade of third legal assistant and five vacancies for fourth legal assistant. The five vacancies at fourth legal assistant level arose as follows: four as a result of the shortfall from the July 2000 competition and one as a result of a person leaving to return to practice at the Bar. A new competition to fill these vacancies will be held this year.</P>
      <P>For legal assistant posts applicants must be barristers and have practised in the State for at least four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other vacancies on the professional side are: six vacancies for parliamentary counsel at grade II level and one at grade I level. Barristers and solicitors are eligible to compete for the posts. The qualification required for the grade I post is seven years practice and four years practice for the grade II posts. A written examination <Col N="510" /> was held on 5 February last. Papers are being corrected and interviews are expected to be held by the Civil Service Commission in March.</P>
    <P>On the administrative side vacancies exist for two higher executive officers, one executive officer, one staff officer and three clerical officers. One of the HEO positions will be filled on 20 March by seconding an AO from the Department of Education and Science and the EO vacancy is due to be filled within the next two weeks from a Civil Service Commission panel.</P>
    <P>Steps are being taken to fill the remaining vacancies in the future. The qualification for all the administrative positions are the same as those required for general Civil Service grade posts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach acknowledge, bearing in mind the level of work that must be undertaken within the Attorney General's office, that it is unsatisfactory that four of the positions for fourth legal assistant advertised last summer have not been filled? There is now a fifth position that has not been filled. Will the Taoiseach agree that these positions should be filled and that there is no reason these vacancies should be available not only to members of the Bar Library but to practising solicitors and academic lawyers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>One likes to fill any vacancy that arises as quickly as possible. I agree with the Deputy that the sooner these vacancies can be filled the better. On the second aspect, the Deputy is well aware of the long-standing practice. It is one with which I agree and it has not changed during all the other times when he and I discussed it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the long-standing practice that has been implemented by successive Attorneys General is that these positions are filled only by practising barristers? Will he confirm that it is the wish of the Attorney General that these positions be filled only by practising barristers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position and has been the practice since the foundation of the State. There are four different sections in the legal services of the State. There is the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government where there are solicitors or barristers; legal assistants have always been recruited from the practising Bar for good and often stated reasons by all the Attorneys General that I can see on file; the Chief State Solicitor's office is the bastion of solicitors, no barristers are allowed in that office, solicitors hold all those posts and the network of State solicitors offices is the same. That is the entire position. Practically all the positions in the State are for barristers only. The Parliamentary Counsel's Office has barristers or solicitors and the 18 or 19 positions in the Attorney General's office are filled by barristers from the Bar Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware it is the Civil Service Commission which is supposed to prescribe the qualifications for filling public service posts and not the Attorney General? Will he indicate what consultation has taken place with the Civil Service Commission to ascertain whether the commission has independently determined these posts should be reserved for members of the Bar? Will he agree it is illogical that they be so reserved in the context of the other posts he has detailed, which are available to members of both professions? Will he agree it is not in the public interest that posts that could be filled by qualified solicitors are kept vacant because members of the Bar Library have not seen fit to apply to fill those posts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I note from many letters over the years, many Attorneys General asked the Law Society to open up posts to both professions but, unfortunately, the files have remained blank. While the Law Society has written many letters on these aspects over the years, whenever Attorneys General asked if it would move to a dual position, it did not answer. Therefore, I do not have the answer to the question.</P>
      <P>On the Civil Service Commission, to my knowledge it is satisfied with the existing arrangements for the reasons set out, that is, barristers provide specialist legal advice, services and representation in relation to litigation, and this has worked well in the past. As I said on many occasions during Question Time, if people were prepared to move to a position of a unified profession, matters would change. I note from many lengthy letters and correspondence from Mr. Gleeson that there were moves at the Bar in relation to the solicitors' profession to approve arrangements whereby established practitioners could transfer from one profession to another. He simplified the matter and set out his position in great detail. To my knowledge, that position has not been challenged by the Law Society. The society makes the case that it should be entitled to apply for the 19 positions but it does not agree that all the other positions in the hands of solicitors should be open to barristers. That is where the argument lies and it is the case which has been made within that profession for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree this is not a matter for either the Bar Counsel or the Law Society? Does he agree there is a need to <Col N="512" /> shake up the legal services provided by the State in the context of recruitment to these services by ending all discrimination and distinctions between solicitors and barristers? Does he agree it is in the public interest that the Chief State Solicitor's office should be able to recruit from the qualified barristers profession and that the Attorney General's office should be able to recruit for any of the positions available within it from the solicitors' profession? Does the Taoiseach agree it is his duty to protect the public interest and that this should not be the privilege of either profession? Will he take steps to ensure these important posts in the Attorney General's office are filled by qualified lawyers, whether solicitors or barristers? Will he take steps to open up the Chief State Solicitor's office to the recruitment of barristers? Finally, will he inform the House of the specific work the four legal assistants in the Attorney General's office undertake and the extent to which the workings of that office are behind as a consequence of its inability to recruit the new staff required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, a number of additional posts were approved last summer. However, all of these posts have not yet been filled. This argument has gone on for 31 years. I do not claim to be an expert but this matter has been considered by the individuals involved at least every second year for the last 30 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so. The question is whether the professions want a unified profession and it appears they do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chief State Solicitors and Attorneys General have taken the view that the present system has worked, is working and will work well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I have discussed the position in the Chief State Solicitor's office, yet when the post of Chief State Solicitor had to be filled last year he did not argue that the new appointment should be a barrister. Other solicitors have long argued for holding positions exclusive to their profession while at the same time they seek to be allowed fill positions which are the preserve of the Bar. I understand their position. The solicitors' profession is not unique in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with the public interest, not with the interests of solicitors or members of the Bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="513" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The solicitors' profession dominates the areas of concern here. I do not mind if the solicitors and barristers combine to form a unified profession. However, there is no will on either side to take this route. I have read a number of the reports made to address this issue over the past 30 years and it is clear that barristers wish to ensure that Attorneys General continue to be recruited from the Bar because of the specialised advice they are required to provide in terms of litigation. Similarly, where it has been the long held practice for posts to be filled from the Law Society, solicitors do not want to change that. I do not have a vested interest in developments in this area, but I would not have any difficulty if it was agreed that the 18 posts reserved for the Bar, of the almost 150 available, were to be recruited from either profession.</P>
      <P>Four or five years ago Mr. Gleeson considered an enormous correspondence on the arguments for and against change and set out the position very well. He made the reasonable case that the people advising him or any Attorney General are best recruited from the Bar because of the work they are expected to do. He equally made the case that recruitment to the grade of Chief Parliamentary Counsel can be made from either profession because experience of litigation in the courts is not necessary. The present and previous Attorneys General agree with him on that. I will not crusade for a unified profession when it is clear that neither side wants it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is not possible to compare the present crisis of staffing in the public service with what has been the precedent? Does he also agree that if the Strategic Management Initiative means anything, the demarcation that has characterised so many aspects of areas of expertise have been swept aside by modernisation and new practices? Does he recognise that citizens' interests are being damaged because there is no legal expert available to the Attorney General, be he or she a solicitor or a barrister? Against the background of the failure to fill these posts and the many vacancies on the administrative side, of which the Taoiseach's replies have given an indication but which could be replicated in most other Departments, will he indicate if he is to take any initiative to ensure that these posts will be filled by suitably qualified people so that citizens' interests and the task of Government can be properly advanced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. There is an urgency about this. Last year the case was put in different sections of the State's legal services, both administrative and the professional, that additional posts were required. They were sanctioned by the Department of Finance. While the competition of last summer did not fill all the posts it addressed the issue of third legal assistants but not fourth legal assistants. There is an urgency about filling some of the other posts so that the additional, heavy and demanding workload of that service is <Col N="514" /> met. I have consulted the Civil Service Commission and the staff involved. While a large number of people applied to participate in last year's competition some did not take up the positions offered them. I understand the numbers were average by comparison with previous occasions. The profile and the effort to recruit people to these positions has to be given an extra impetus. I am certainly doing that and I have asked that this competition should be earlier and perhaps advertised in a more dynamic way to get a greater response. It is important that these positions are filled. Obviously, they would not have been approved if they were not necessary. The fact they are necessary means people should be in those positions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I wrote to Mr. Ariel Sharon on 8 February congratulating him on his election as Prime Minister of the State of Israel. I indicated in my letter that Ireland continues to look forward to a satisfactory outcome to the Middle East peace process. In this regard, I note last night's decision by the Israeli Labour Party to join a unity government with Mr. Sharon. I hope the establishment of a unity government will assist in an early resumption of meaningful negotiations towards achieving the goal of a just and lasting peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> In advance of the European Council in Stockholm on 23 and 24 March, I met yesterday with Prime Minister Persson of Sweden, who came to Dublin as the first stop on his pre-summit tour of capitals. The main purpose of the Stockholm European Council is to give heads of state or government the opportunity to take a strategic overview of progress towards achieving the goal we set last year at Lisbon, namely by 2010 to make the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.</P>
    <P>Achieving this very ambitious target requires continuing action across a wide range of areas both at the EU level and by the member states individually. While specific decisions are for the Council, in its various sectoral formats, to make, or for national governments, it is important that the European Council is able to look at the big picture and give overall direction.</P>
    <P>Prime Minister Persson and I had an excellent and productive exchange of views. He outlined to me how the Presidency intends to organise the meeting and we discussed the proposals presented by the Commission in the Synthesis Report published earlier this month. The Synthesis Report identified ten priority areas in which it is hoped progress can be made at Stockholm. We agreed that the Commission paper is a very good basis for discussion and that it is likely agreement can be reached on most of the issues it raises.</P>
    <P>While Prime Minister Persson is looking forward to a comprehensive debate, he is anxious to place a particular focus on how we should respond to demographic change in Europe and, in particular, the ageing of the population. He also places particular stress on the economic potential of biotechnology, while recognising that the scientific and ethical issues need to be fully debated and carefully worked out. The Prime Minister also wants to ensure there is a linkage between the Union's socio-economic strategy and its approach to sustainable development, which will be fully debated in its own right at the June European Council in Gothenburg.</P>
    <P>We share with our partners the objective of developing policies that promote employment, economic reform, research and innovation in the knowledge-based economy and social cohesion and at Stockholm we will work to encourage progress under each of these headings. Another major aspect of the Stockholm Council will be a discussion with the Russian President, Mr. Putin, who has accepted an invitation to attend a session. It is expected that this will focus on economic and social aspects of the EU-Russia relationship. This will be an important and valuable opportunity for dialogue and I congratulated Prime Minister Persson on arranging it. Inevitably, as always happens at European Councils, there will be other urgent issues of the day which <Col N="516" /> will require attention, but it is too early to say in detail what these will be.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present for further meetings with EU colleagues to discuss Stockholm, although I will meet Prime Minister Blair tomorrow on other issues. My Department, and the other Departments concerned with the issues which will arise at Stockholm are in close touch with their relevant counterparts. Furthermore, national views or proposals which have so far been sent to the Presidency by member states have been copied to all capitals, so we all have quite a good idea of one another's views. I will speak directly to my colleagues if this appears necessary closer to the time.</P>
    <P>While I will meet President Prodi at the Stockholm and Gothenburg European Councils, I am also pleased he has accepted an invitation from me to visit Ireland. The intention is that the visit will take place in June. Officials have had preliminary discussions on the shape of his programme and I believe it will be a valuable opportunity to welcome the President to this country and to have substantive discussions with him on the range of issues on the Union agenda at that time.</P>

        <b>:</b> How does the Taoiseach justify sending congratulations to Mr. Sharon on his election as Prime Minister of Israel when Mr. Sharon is responsible, as a result of a visit a few months ago to a very sensitive shrine, for the current tragedy in Palestine and Israel which has left approximately 400 people dead, the majority Palestinian but Jewish people as well? Was the Taoiseach aware, when sending his congratulations, of the murderous reputation and history of Mr. Ariel Sharon dating back to 1953 when he commanded unit 101 which was responsible for the massacre of 69 Palestinians in the village of Kibya? Was he further aware that Mr. Sharon was a key architect of the illegal settlements in the West Bank and was held responsible for the horrific massacre of 2,000 innocent men, women and children in the camps of Sabra and Chatila in Beirut in 1982? Will the Taoiseach explain the difference between Mr. Sharon's history and the brutal history of Slobodan Milosevic, former President of Serbia, whose brutal ethnic cleansing policies were offered as the reason for the NATO bombing campaign?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long-standing practice in this country to send a message of congratulations to a democratically elected president of a state which is friendly to us, and I sent a brief message to Mr. Sharon. I am aware of Mr. Sharon's reputation as a promoter of new Israeli settlements and a critic of the negotiations with the Palestinians. However, he has extensive experience in government and is well aware that Israeli security is dependent on good relationships with Israel's neighbours, the nearest of whom are the Palestinians. I hope Mr. Sharon will use his time in the new National Unity Government to build on the excellent discussions which took place over the years which have unfortunately broken down in the past four to five months resulting in horrific deaths. The National Unity Government includes people who have a record of commitment to the peace process. We must await further developments in this area before arriving at any conclusions.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I spoke to Mr. Persson, President of the European Council, who is anxious to play a greater role in this area. Special envoy, Mr. Javier Solana, has been involved in this area for the past two years but it is felt in Europe that a greater role could perhaps now be played in the construction of a peace agreement. Only a short number of months ago, prior to Mr. Barak calling the election, an agreement was imminent and a summit was to be held in Stockholm. Unfortunately, statements were made at that time which unsettled those arrangements and the peace accord, which was progressing well, floundered.</P>

      <P>President Arafat made a statement only days before the talks were to commence in Stockholm and Mr. Barak refused to attend the summit although President Arafat effectively apologised. I believe Mr. Barak should have attended the talks as his non-attendance resulted in a glorious opportunity being lost.

      <P>It depends on who asks the question. Sentiments are attributed to Mr. Prodi in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> which state that he does not propose to visit Ireland before a referendum on the Nice Treaty because he can establish our position on issues by talking to Mr. Blair. The American President stated last week that any involvement he would have in Northern Ireland policy would be at the request of the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. Is our foreign policy position so weak that our position on Europe and the United States has to be brokered by the British Prime Minister? What is the Taoiseach's view on Mr. Blair being under the impression that he can be our spokesman with the President of the European Commission and the President of the United States on matters of fundamental importance to this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen that article in the newspaper. I can only assume it is a mistake by President Prodi. He does much of his business by telephone rather than in writing and I have had many conversations with him. He is due to visit here shortly, and in his diary June is &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;. I discussed this with him on the telephone. He had hoped to come in February but that was not possible because of other commitments. I do not imagine Prime Minister Blair would discuss European matters related to Ireland with him.</P>
      <P>This week the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, will meet the US Secretary of State, and a number of other senior officials in the Administration to discuss Security Council matters, Northern Ireland and other issues. I will meet President Bush in a fortnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I refer the Taoiseach to the European diary in today's <i>The Irish Times </i>which <Col N="519" /> is not guess work. It states that Mr. Prodi indicated privately that if he wants to find out the Irish position on matters he can talk to Tony Blair. Will the Taoiseach inquire into this matter? In respect of President Bush's inclination to be led on Northern Ireland affairs by Prime Minister Blair, how does the Taoiseach propose to refocus the White House's attention on Northern Ireland affairs? I understand that when the Taoiseach visits Washington for St. Patrick's Day, while he will present the shamrock in the traditional manner, there will be no White House reception for the Irish. I understand also that delegates from North and South who travel to Washington are referred to the State Department. The First Minister of the Northern Assembly, Mr. Trimble, was met by an Assistant Secretary in the State Department on his recent visit to Washington. I am concerned by the downgrading of the Irish foreign affairs position, both in Europe and in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan should be careful in saying there has been a downgrading of our position in Europe. Both the General Affairs and Agriculture Councils met yesterday, and I met the President of the Commission. Deputy Noonan's remarks do not stand up to analysis and are silly.</P>
      <P>As regards the White House, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen will meet Colin Powell and other senior officials in the next few days to discuss Security Council issues and Northern Ireland. I will meet the President as part of formal St. Patrick's Day arrangements. I understand that President Bush is to attend lunch on Capitol Hill, although arrangements are tentative. Perhaps Deputy Noonan has information which is not available to me, but as far as I know there will be a formal meeting with the President to present the traditional shamrock.</P>
      <P>There will not be any social craic agus rince, but that will not affect diplomatic relations as it only started in recent years. As far as I understand, the other meetings will take place. Despite our small size, we will be one of the first countries to talk to the President. New arrangements between the State Department and the North have not yet been made clear. A number of key officials equivalent to those we had contact with over the past eight years are not in position, as almost 5,000 people have yet to be recruited. Such matters will be teased out in discussions between the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and Colin Powell, and in my meetings with President Bush.</P>

      <P>Did the Taoiseach, during his meeting with the Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson yesterday, discuss the damage to Ireland from the unnecessary row with the Commission? Broad economic policy guidelines are to be formulated at a summit in Stockholm in March, which is a follow-up from Lisbon. Did the Taoiseach discuss with the President of the Council the steps to be taken at the summit by Ireland and the Presidency to ensure there will not be a repeat of what transpired earlier this year? Did the Taoiseach express regret at the damage caused to Ireland's relationship with the rest of the Union, particularly that between Ireland and the rest of the euro zone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the matter for discussion with Göran Persson. I assure Deputies that I am confident damage has not been done. We discussed items on the agenda where we could usefully work together and where I could support the President. We have a good track record on some of these items, but not on others where we should help. We will not try to reinvent the wheel in Stockholm. The conclusions and profits of Lisbon will be further developed by Mr. Persson during his Presidency and in the spring summit so that by 2010, Europe will have reached dynamic growth and will be better able to deal with information technology.</P>
      <P>There are two new matters that Mr. Persson wants to introduce in Stockholm which were not discussed in Lisbon. The first of these is biotechnology, including the risks, fears and concerns that surround the issue. He also wants to add demographics to the agenda, so that the ageing of the community can be discussed. This country is not experienced as regards the second of these matters, but we can certainly help with the first, by building on last year's Lisbon conclusions.</P>

      <P>In light of the crisis in Britain and the ongoing BSE crisis, did the Taoiseach raise with the President of the Council Ireland's concerns regarding the double attack faced by the agricultural community in Europe, particularly in Ireland? If so, what was his response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did and in any meeting I will have this week, I will do that. Most of our discussion centred around the BSE issue, as the President is far more familiar with it and it is now an issue, albeit a smaller one, in his country, although I think it is a false alarm. I am not sure of the veterinary analysis in that regard. The Deputy probably read over the weekend that he has difficulties as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BSE is a major issue in many countries, particularly Germany and France, which he must preside over on this issue. The cost factor is a major issue, not to mind the destruct system. There is the matter of people's views on it and what will be needed to develop a sustainable, strong and coherent policy to stabilise the veterinary and market situations. That will affect us and the <Col N="521" /> United Kingdom because of the foot and mouth disease issue. The President's view is that the BSE issue must be resolved.</P>
    <P>The French would strongly hold the view, as would we, that the Berlin negotiations on this matter cannot be opened up, but the Germans would hold the view that they should be. These issues will continue to be discussed at Agricultural Councils and perhaps other Councils over the next period.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Walsh, stayed over for an early morning meeting to discuss these matters with the Agricultural Commissioner, Franz Fischler, and I understand what was said yesterday on these issues was satisfactory enough.</P>
    <P>I briefed the President yesterday on the views here regarding the seriousness of the food and mouth disease situation, the difficulties it poses for us and the types of measures we had to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the manner in which the Minister for Finance handled the reprimand from the European Commission on Ireland's budgetary and fiscal policy, is the Taoiseach aware of a widespread belief that we are being diplomatically isolated in Europe and that belief is reinforced by the Tánaiste's unwise threat to the commitments given at the Treaty of Nice in a recent newspaper article? Will he use the Stockholm Summit to repair some of the diplomatic damage done by the unwise manner in which the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance handled this affair? Will he arrange bilateral meetings with his counterparts in Europe on the margins of the Stockholm Summit to repair this diplomatic damage?</P>

Was the Taoiseach's office consulted about the article? Did he see it before it was published?

The Cabinet, the Government parties and the House are aware of my view on this matter because I have stated it on a number of occasions, for example, during the debate on the Nice summit. The Nice Treaty is about enlargement. Regardless of debates and arguments on side issues, the enlargement process is part of European philosophy and the great dream of making Europe a success.

It is a major part of the way in which we want Europe to develop. This is what the Nice Treaty is about; it is not about anything else.

The resolution of this can only be a comprehensive settlement, which deals with all of the territories, with those who were in the 1947 camps and with all of the other issues which have been spelt out in Camp David and all other areas where there have been talks over the past three or four years.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have felt for some time that the current school meals scheme falls a long way short of what is required. Some 33 local authorities participate in this scheme with a current <Col N="525" /> spend of about £650,000. I do not consider that the simple expansion of that scheme would meet the needs of today's school children in an efficient or effective manner.</P>
      <P>A major reform of policy is required in this area and a new and innovative approach is necessary. Accordingly, I established some time ago an interdepartmental working group, chaired by my Department, to review the existing scheme with a view to developing proposals for the future of the school meals provision.</P>
      <P>The group has engaged in an extensive consultation process as part of the review. All of the issues and difficulties with the current scheme and suggestions for a reformed scheme which have emerged during the consultation process will inform the group's consideration of the future policy direction for the scheme.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive the working group's report in the summer of this year, following which I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government regarding a reformed school meals scheme. Pending completion of the report, I provided £300,000 interim funding for this pilot scheme towards the food costs for the voluntary and community groups and schools currently providing school meals outside of the existing scheme to which I referred earlier. This funding has been allocated initially to nine groups working in this area and will benefit approximately 2,200 children. The Department currently has 37 applications on hand and decisions in relation to these will be made shortly. A further 14 schools and groups have made inquiries about the scheme.</P>
      <P>My officials have been working with officials from the Department of Education and Science, both on the review and the targeting of the interim funding. In this context, details of the funding arrangements were recently circulated to all schools, included in the stay in school retention initiative of the Department of Education and Science. It is expected that this will generate a considerable number of additional applications.</P>
      <P>I recently visited two of the groups funded by my Department &ndash; a breakfast club in the Dublin 17 area and an all day food service operating in Drogheda. The value of their work cannot be over estimated.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional information</i>I fully acknowledge that the overall allocation of £300,000 is a modest sum in the context of what needs to be done in the area, but as I said it is interim funding pending completion of the review.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. After four years in the Department, I am glad to see he is hitting the ground running on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Late last year the Minister told my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, that he expected the working group report early in 2001. He now tells the House that the report is not expected until the summer of this year and he will then bring for<Col N="526" /> ward proposals. Could he give a commitment to the House that he wants to put this scheme on a statutory footing? Will he further indicate to the House the total number of children who are affected beneficially as a result of this scheme?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot second guess what the working group will come up with. The issue of whether the scheme will be put on a statutory footing must obviously wait until the report is on my desk, but I already indicated that as an interim measure I provided £300,000 in this year's Estimate for the current pilot scheme under the existing scheme, which has been in place since 1914. There had been no review of that scheme and I was the first Minister to bring forward such review.</P>
      <P>As I said, 33 local authorities availed of the scheme. The spend has been decreasing over the past decade or so; it is currently £650,000.</P>
      <P>This other scheme, which is based on participation by voluntary and community groups, is the way in which we will proceed. I am aware of the excellent work being carried out in partnership by schools, the teachers, the staff, the parents who are an important force in this regard, and the pupils. The analysis resulting from the examination of these pilot schemes has been positive in that there is a strong suggestion, particularly from the teachers, that children availing of these pilot schemes are coming to, and remaining in, school and are much more fulfilled because they have proper meals. There are fewer incidents of them bringing crisps and Coke, etc., into schools.</P>
      <P>I am a great supporter of this scheme. I would like to think that once the report is submitted in the summer, it will feed into the budgetary process which will take place thereafter.</P>

Could the Minister explain to the House why local authorities are still involved in administering this scheme? Why should urban councils have any role in respect of administering this scheme? We have one of the worst records in Europe in respect of providing schemes like this to primary school children and the current level of provision is hopelessly inadequate to meet the existing demand. Will the Minister further outline to the House the expenditure for this scheme in 1998, 1999 and 2000?</P>

      <P>The project to effect a smooth transition to the euro in my Department is well in hand. The necessary resources are in place and detailed plans have been drawn up covering the changes needed to the computer systems which support the business, the staff training needed and the information needs of our customers. Work is proceeding on schedule and a smooth transition is expected. In accordance with these plans, payments to customers up to and including 31 December 2001, will issue in Irish pounds and from 1 January 2002 all payments will issue in euro. As I said previously, the amounts will be rounded up to the benefit of customers.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decided some time ago to align for the first time the tax and calendar years from 1 January 2002. The Government has also decided that increases in weekly social welfare payments will apply from the beginning of January 2002.</P>
      <P>The period between the announcement of budget increases and the coming into effect of those increases has been sufficiently long in the past to enable the increases to be incorporated in pension order books as from the normal renewal dates of those books. Deputies would agree this was a source of much complaint from recipients. Because of bringing forward the increases to 1 January, however, the time will obviously be shortened and there will be some delay in the implementation of the increases. Every effort will be made to ensure that any such delay is kept to a minimum. Payment at existing rates will continue and any delayed increases will be fully paid. The administrative arrangements for payment of the arrears are currently under consideration and all options are being examined to ensure that any delay in people receiving their increase is minimised.</P>
      <P>In the current year the date for the budget increases has been brought forward substantially to April. This means that for the first time, social welfare increases will come into effect at the same time as the changes in the income tax provisions announced in the budget.</P>
      <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the Secretary General of his Department, in response to an inquiry under the Freedom of Information Act by the journalist, Olivia Doyle, said in effect that the implementation of the increases in euros on 1 January was absolutely impossible? Does the Minister admit that it will not be possible to keep to that timetable? Does he agree there is deep and widespread concern among pensioners and social welfare recipients generally at ongoing rampant inflation and the possibility of a similar &ldquo;rip-off&rdquo; during the change-over to the euro, as happened previously with decimalisation of the Irish currency? This is reported to be happening already on drink prices.</P>

      <P>The date of 1 January will be a very busy time because of the changeover to the euro. I remind the Deputy that, when this Government came into office, the December budget of the previous Government provided that people did not get their increases in social welfare payments until the following June or July. Now, as a result of the decisions which we have made progressively over the past four years, all the payments have been brought forward to 5 April this year and, for the first time, will be aligned with the tax year.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as of next budget, the social welfare increases and tax arrangements will operate from 1 January, 2002. There will be a huge gain for people on social welfare. The cost to the Exchequer and the gain to social welfare recipients as a result of the earlier operative date will be £85 million. There is a six months cycle involved in changing social welfare books, as they are known. No matter what date we pick in relation to the increases in payments, social welfare recipients will have their books changed at various times after 1 January 2002 but in reality their increases will be effective from that date. It is to the credit of this Government that those payments and the tax adjustments are being brought forward as close as possible to budget date.</P>

      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy was launched in April 1997. The overall target, as revised in 1999, is to reduce the numbers of those who are consistently poor from 9% to 15% of the population to less than 5% by 2004. We are well on our way towards achieving this target.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, we committed ourselves to revising and renewing the national anti-poverty strategy. The methodology underlying the strategy will be reviewed, existing targets reviewed and revised where appropriate and new targets will be considered under the themes of child poverty, women's poverty, health, older people and housing accommodation. Indicators will be considered under the national anti-poverty strategy themes, so that achievement of targets can be monitored over time.</P>
      <P>A number of working groups, with social partner participation, have been or are being established to facilitate the review of targets, the development of indicators and policies to meet targets. The areas being covered are housing-accommodation, health, employment, education, rural poverty and urban disadvantage. Each of the working groups will hold at least one consultative seminar and an advertisement calling for submissions to the review process was placed in national newspapers on 13 February. A further meeting with the social partners will be held on 21 March to discuss the progress of the review to date.</P>
      <P>A separate working group has been established, with an independent chairperson, to examine the issues in relation to benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments. The working groups are due to report by June. This will be followed by a completion process involving a steering committee with representation from the working groups, including the social partners, and a national seminar on the strategy. It is expected the revised national anti-poverty strategy will be prepared by September.</P>

      <P>By what date does the Minister expect to have new targets set for the elimination of child poverty, including relative child poverty? A recent Combat Poverty Agency report to the Minister revealed that one quarter of Irish children are poor, with 17% experiencing chronic poverty. What action does the Minister intend taking in his Department to address this? The Combat Poverty Agency suggested a basic <Col N="530" /> income level for children, whereby the State should support children whose families are unable to do so. It suggested a child care subsidy and a range of other initiatives. What is the Minister's response to the Combat Poverty Agency's report of last February which contains many initiatives which, according to the agency, would begin to eliminate child poverty? </P>

      <P>The substantial increase in child benefit of £25 for each of the first two children and £30 for subsequent children compares very favourably with the previous Government's last budget, which gave £1 each for the first two children and £5 for the third and subsequent children. We have also agreed that, over the next two budgets, similar increases amounting to £330 million, will be given. The Combat Poverty Agency, which is normally critical of the proposals of every Government, was highly complimentary towards the measures in this Government's last budget. I rest my case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Improving child benefit is only one aspect of eliminating child poverty. In itself, it is simply not enough. It is clear from the report and from common sense, that the situation requires a range of other initiatives as well as improving child benefit. What other action does the Minister intend to take to deal with child poverty? It is clear the child benefit rates were not as generous as they could have been. It is the children of families dependant on social welfare who are most at risk. The Government was not very generous in the improvements in social welfare benefits this year.</P>

      <P>The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration. <Col N="531" /> There is an inevitable time lag in such a process which is governed by statutory and fair procedure requirements.</P>
      <P>The average time taken to process all appeals closed during 2000 was just under 21 weeks. This average period includes all phases of appeals, including the additional time involved in the determination of appeals where, for example, further investigations have to be made or where adjournments have been sought by the appellant or by the legal representative acting on his behalf. The corresponding figure in 1996 was 18 weeks and was around the 21 to 22 week mark in the three following years. Since 1996, however, when the number of appeals received was just over 12,000, the annual intake of appeals has increased by 45% and, in the past year, 17,650 appeals were received.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these increases, average processing times have been broadly maintained during the past four years. While processing times in the social welfare appeals office compare favourably with international experience in this area, the achievement of improvements in processing times is a major objective of the office. It is necessary to ensure progress in this regard is achieved in a manner that is not in conflict with, or at a cost to, the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits. To cope with the increasing workload, two additional appeals officers were appointed in 1997 and two more were assigned during 1999. A further officer is expected to take up duty at the appeals office next week.</P>
      <P>During this year a management consultancy study will be undertaken of the role, functions and organisation of the social welfare appeals office, including examination of all the processes involved in dealing with claims to the appeals stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the publication of the review of the one parent family payment in September 2000, I initiated a programme to ensure recipients are fully aware of the various supports which are available to them in the areas of education, training and employment. This programme includes a number of elements, including dissemination of information on entitlements and a closer engagement with lone parents to help them avail of these supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme is at an early stage and involves the Department's jobs facilitators providing individual interviews for lone parents to discuss future job, education, training or development requirements. The programme is being introduced on a phased basis, concentrating initially on one parent family payment recipients with older children. In this regard, about 2,500 <Col N="533" /> people will be invited for interview. My Department is also planning to localise the administration of the scheme from the pensions services office in Sligo to its local offices, and this will bring lone parents into closer contact on an ongoing basis with the various support services available in the Department's offices. It is expected a pilot scheme will be in place later this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, pilot family services projects are under way in three local offices of my Department in Dublin, Cork and Waterford. These projects build on the one stop shop concept with the aim of providing improved access to information for families. An enhanced programme of support is available to a small group of customers with complex needs. Very young lone mothers are a particular target for this aspect of the service.</P>
    <P>The operation of the pilot schemes has been evaluated and the recommendations are being examined at management level within my Department. The Government has provided £12 million over the period 2000-06 in the national development plan for the progressive expansion of the successful elements of the pilot programme.</P>
    <P>Under the existing rules of the back to work allowance scheme, lone parents are not eligible to avail of the scheme until they are 21 years of age. The existing income disregards which apply to the one parent family payment should be an adequate incentive for this group to take up employment. In the circumstances, I have no plans to introduce a lower qualifying age for teenage parents or to introduce additional allowances. However, I will keep this under review.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The review of the one parent family payment highlighted the poor standard of education of this group, with early school leaving a particular problem. To encourage and assist them to return to the school system, I introduced changes in the budget for 2001 to the back to education scheme. From this autumn a lower qualifying age limit of 18 years, currently 21, will apply to recipients of the one parent family allowance who have been on the payment for at least six months and who have been out of the educational system for two years.</P>
    <P>Overall my Department is piloting a number of initiatives to ensure it works much more closely with this group of welfare recipients. Obviously it will take some time to test these approaches and to mainstream the successful elements throughout the office network. However, I am satisfied that we must work more closely with this group and with other service agencies to ensure their life chances and those of their children are improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>This year, approximately 3,000 teenagers will give birth in Ireland. Will the Minister consider introducing a scheme in each county to support such parents? The evidence is that the <Col N="534" /> majority of them will opt out of school and education generally and will not be able to stay in employment because not enough supports exist to enable them to do this.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister extend the pilot projects introduced by the Department so that more young teenage parents can benefit from individual counselling and support, as has been done in Australia and the UK? There are good models and supports for young parents in those countries. Will the Minister take action on allowances to ensure young parents can continue with training and education? The majority leave when they become pregnant or when they give birth. The services the Department offers are provided in a general manner. There is a need to target young teenage parents so they receive assistance at an early stage rather than becoming dependent on allowances for years on end.</P>

      <P>We announced in the budget that we would introduce changes to the one parent family payment and the Deputy will have noticed additional changes in the Social Welfare Bill, the Committee Stage of which we will discuss tomorrow.</P>
      <P>From this autumn a lower qualifying age of 18, currently 21, will apply to recipients of the one parent family allowance who have received it for six months and who have been out of the education system for two years. Changes are being made and I compliment the Deputy and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs on bringing forward a report in this respect recently. The review of the one parent family payment which we issued some time ago gave a number of pointers for changes to the allowance.</P>
      <P>That said, I fully accept what the Deputy said about assisting pregnant teenagers. I am aware of an excellent scheme that deals with teenage pregnancies run by a number of mothers in Waterford. Between my Department and the Department of Education and Science, that scheme was picked up. The latter Department now assists that group because it is a model for other groups and because it is something for which the Minister for Education and Science would have responsibility.</P>
      <P>The pilot projects in my area of responsibility are designed not just for teenage lone mothers but for lone mothers generally. They are there to assist them not only through income support, as is normal for my Department, but also by examining other issues across a number of agencies and Departments through which we can assist lone parents. The experiences of the three centres in Cork, Waterford and Dublin have been extremely beneficial. The Government has agreed to allocate £12 million over the lifetime of the national development plan to roll that out on a wider basis.</P>

      <P>It is an essential part of my Department's customer service policy to ensure that citizens are made aware of their entitlements and are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur. An essential element of this is the provision of comprehensive information in a clear and simple manner. My Department tries to ensure that information in relation to all its schemes, including family income supplement, is widely available to the public so that entitlements, where appropriate, can be claimed.</P>
      <P>Information and publicity on the family income supplement scheme is provided in a variety of different ways with a view to increasing the level of take-up. For example, information on family income supplement is currently available on child benefit books, is provided to all one-parent families when awarded a one-parent family allowance, is provided to all employers in PRSI mail shots from my Department, and entitlement is considered for all applicants for the back to work allowance. In addition, the scheme is extensively advertised through local and national media outlets, including newspapers, radio, and the Aertel service, as well as through poster campaigns and targeted mail shots</P>
      <P>From 5 April this year, as announced in the budget, the income limits governing entitlement to family income supplement are being increased by £25 at each point resulting in an average increase of £15 per week for all recipients. These improvements will be advertised closer to the effective date of increase and should also further enhance awareness and take-up of the scheme. The number of persons in receipt of family income supplement at the end of January 2001 was 12,769.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy. Since coming into office I have encouraged my officials to advertise schemes generally on local radio and to participate in the types of programmes referred to by him. Since taking up office I have endeavoured to ensure that the take-up of the family income supplement increased. There is no longer the same reliance on that scheme given the current state of the economy and the fact that many people are now taking up well paid jobs. It is true that in previous years the scheme was not properly advertised but people now understand their entitlements when taking up paid employment. The current buoyancy in the market has resulted in a slower uptake of the scheme. I will take on board what the Deputy said. </P>

      <P>Is it not true that one of the useful functions which many of us perform is to circularise our constituents with information regarding their social welfare entitlements? In effect, this should be done by the Department. Deputy Browne is correct. The Minister earlier this week publicised the £200 million recovery from fraud which we welcome but it is not a fact that the Minister owes up to £60 million to low income families and pensioners? He admitted that only a few weeks ago regarding non-contributory pensions. Is it possible that every household be mailed a full briefing on their social welfare entitlements?</P>

      <P>Since coming into office, I have been particularly aware of the need to target groups of social welfare recipients. I was the first Minister to propose and ensure every old age pensioner received a 40 page booklet on their entitlements not only regarding social welfare but regarding taxation, health and medical cards. I applied the same exercise to approximately 17,000 carers and 100,000 people in receipt of invalidity and disability pension.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may not have noticed an advertisement in the national papers and the EU Journal for a contract to send to every household &ndash; approximately 1.4 billion &ndash; a 24 page booklet containing information regarding social welfare entitlements, including FIS.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Christmas bonus payments are provided by my Department to people in receipt of certain long-term social welfare payments. These payments are made to alleviate hardship due to the additional demands on people's resources at Christmas time. Last Christmas, the bonus was increased from 70% to 100%, the equivalent of an extra week's payment.</P>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme on the other hand is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. Fuel allowances of £5 per week are paid to eligible households and £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones. These allowances will be paid for 28 weeks in the fuel season from October 2000 to April 2001 and for 29 weeks in the 2001-02 fuel season. This represents an extension of three weeks in the fuel season. Virtually all recipients of fuel allowance benefited from the increase in the Christmas bonus from 70% to 100%. The increase was worth more than £23 in the case of single people on long-term unemployment assistance and at least £37 for couples.</P>
      <P>Providing a double payment of fuel allowance at Christmas would, in effect mean paying one additional week of the allowance, with a value of either £8 or £5. While I accept this would be a popular innovation, I chose instead to extend the fuel season not by one week but by three weeks. Together with giving people an additional 30% on their Christmas bonus payment, this is a more beneficial approach to providing income support over the entire winter period.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that the problem is that there has not been an increase in the national fuel scheme since its introduction by a Fine Gael-Labour Government in 1984, a remarkable 15 or 16 years? Every pensioner who stops me asks why the payment is not being increased or doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today is a bitterly cold day as has been the case in recent days. Is it not true that the Minister should have aimed at having a 52 week fuel season rather than a 29 week one? Many pensioners feel cold even in June or July. Should the payment be <Col N="538" /> doubled and should the fuel season be increased to 52 weeks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue has been discussed during budget time in recent years. The free fuel scheme review which took place a few years ago suggested that rather than increasing the free fuel allowance it would be far better if we gave the primary payments to old age pensioners and others in receipt of this allowance in their weekly payment over 52 weeks. This is one of the reasons we gave larger than normal weekly increases over the 52 week period rather than increase the £5 fuel allowance. I think the Deputy will accept that if the fuel allowance was increased households would have their income reduced by a substantial amount each week after the cut-off date in April, which obviously would be a big burden on them.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance. The new scheme will be operated by the local authorities and will help to ensure a full range of housing options is made available to people with long-term housing needs who rely on supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement.</P>
      <P>The Government's &ldquo;Action on Housing&rdquo; document, published in June 2000, indicated that a more supply-based approach to rental assistance would be explored. Arising from this, my colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal proposes to set up pilot schemes in nine local authorities to provide rental accommodation in the private sector for people who would otherwise rely on SWA rent supplement. Under this proposal the local authorities will procure suitable property from property owners and offer tenancies in those properties to people on their housing lists who are also on SWA rent supplement.</P>
      <P>The trade unions representing community welfare officers, IMPACT and SIPTU have indicated that they will not co-operate with these pilot schemes unless they get certain guarantees concerning their members' future employment. Discussions are being held with the unions concerned to resolve this. If the industrial relations issues are resolved and the pilot schemes are successful, a permanent scheme will be established. It is expected that the pilot schemes will run for around 12 months and a further two year time frame is envisaged for introducing the new arrangements once the detailed proposals have been agreed.</P>

      <P>The Government accepted the views expressed in the review of the scheme. The main responsibility for administration of the scheme will rest with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Deputy may be aware of the difficult industrial relations issues regarding the future employment of community welfare officers. This, by and large, is the reason the issue has progressed slowly. Obviously we want to progress the issue in a way which will preserve the employment of people in the community welfare system who believe that if responsibility for the scheme is taken from them there will be no work for them. There is also the difficulty that those who work as community welfare officers in health boards are on different scales from those who are employed by local authorities. These issues cause huge difficulties.</P>

Local authorities deal with people's long-term needs and it makes sense to have a connection between the delivery of rent supplement and the people who try to look after the needs of those on the housing lists. It does not make sense, as has been the case up to now, for the scheme to be administered by my Department which has no connection with the local authority system. When the rent supplement scheme was introduced in 1990 the figure was approximately £6 million, while it is now approaching £120 million.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Browne, this issue was first identified in 1995 when I was in Opposition and it was only when we came into Government three years ago that it was decided to look at ways of changing the system.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Hayes, there will be some transfer from my Department to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It is envisaged under the new scheme that people on the housing list for 12 months will be paid by my Department and that once they go over the 12 month period the issue will be taken up by the local authority.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan's question on whether local authorities should rent houses should more appropriately be addressed to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. It is an issue which needs to be addressed. When one looks at the amount of money expended on the scheme in the past few years there needs to be a connection in order to ensure that people on the housing list get a rent supplement and that those who do not need to be on the housing list do not get a rent supplement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 305 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs in September 1999 is based on the report Towards a Senior Euro Pass which was com<Col N="541" /> missioned by the Social Affairs Directorate of the European Commission and was undertaken and published by Age Concern, England at the end of 1997. It recommends that EU states should establish a senior euro pass card which would entitle older people to concessions on various services, including travel, cultural and social activities.</P>
    <P>The role of my Department in matters relating to the senior euro pass is to submit observations in conjunction with other Departments and statutory and non-statutory bodies on any action taken to implement the proposals in this report in so far as they affect the business of the Department. The administration of the euro pass is outside the remit of my Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's inquiry regarding concessions on air travel, I am not aware of any proposal at EU Commission level to extend special or concessional air travel to social welfare recipients of the European Union.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept there have been three European reports and a recommendation by the European Commission going back to 1989 on the creation of an over 60s travel card which would be applicable throughout Europe? Does he further accept that if the same were in existence 500,000 Irish senior citizens would have the right of avail of travel and other concessions across the 15 member states of the European Union? Do I detect from the Minister that he is not supportive of the idea and that the report which I prepared on behalf of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs has not been given active consideration or received support of any kind from him?</P>

      <P>As I have stated on previous occasions, this is not necessarily an issue which should be directed at my Department. We cannot make concessions in regard to a card without doing so in an overall European context. Given that our concessionary travel is perhaps more beneficial than that in any other country in western Europe, obviously we have to bear in mind that the concessions we would give to their people coming here would not be the same as the concessions our people would get from them.</P>
      <P>As I have said previously on Question Time it is an issue that would have to be dealt with at EU level. The Deputy will be pleased to hear our counterparts across the Border, the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, have recently announced that a free cross-Border travel scheme will be available to old-age pensioners in the North. We will sit down with our colleagues to ensure there will be free travel on both sides of the Border.</P>

Will the Minister ensure that he follows the lead originally given by me, followed up by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland, by extending to Northern pensioners the concessions that apply here? Will he proceed further in the context of the two islands to consider pensioners in the UK, many of whom are of Irish decent and anxious to come to Ireland? May this lead to a Euro pass covering the entire Community? Will the Minister shake himself and do something at his end to give a lead in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 40 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Where a person claims a payment from my Department in respect of disability, an opinion regarding a claimant's medical condition is given in the first instance by the person's own doctor. Where required, a second opinion is provided by medical assessors employed by my Department for the guidance of the Department's deciding officers who ultimately determine entitlement.</P>
      <P>This follows an overall assessment of the situation and the carrying out of a medical examination in appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are 21 medical assessors, including the chief medical adviser and the deputy chief medical adviser. They are recruited via the Civil Service Commission and a condition of their appointment is that they must have at least six years' experience in general medical practice. They are fully qualified and experienced medical practitioners who have full registration in accordance with Medical Council criteria. Prior to qualification as doctors, each undergoes psychiatric training to the appropriate level.</P>
      <P>Among the medical assessor cadre are individual doctors with post-graduate and higher qualifications in various fields of occupational medicine, including psychology and psychotherapy. Ongoing medical education is provided by national and international experts in the evaluation of disability. There are also regular meetings and seminars under the direction of the chief medical adviser where a range of medical issues and developments in the occupational medicine field are discussed.</P>
      <P>When a claimant is called for a medical examination, the medical assessor will have available to him or her the initial medical diagnosis, supplemented, where appropriate, by relevant specialist and other reports. The claimant's doctor is informed and may attend the medical examination if he so desires. Where considered necessary, there is provision for the chief medical adviser or the chief appeals officer to seek specialist consultant advice in a particular case.</P>
      <P>In the course of medical examinations of claimants all relevant and available medical information is taken into account.</P>
      <P>Any information provided by the claimant is also taken into account. Where further specialists' advice is considered necessary, it is obtained. I am satisfied that claimants are treated in a fair and equitable manner having regard to the need to ensure that the conditions for entitlements to disability payments are upheld.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>Last year I introduced a special half-rate old age (contributory) pension, payable from 5 May 2000, for people who commenced insurable employment before 1953 and who had at least five years' paid insurance comprising either national health insurance or a combination of social insurance and national health insurance. The pension payable is £48 per week and amounts to 50 per cent of the maximum weekly personal rate. Increases for qualified adults and child dependants, where applicable, are also payable at 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction, some 4,300 pre-1953 pensions have been awarded to people not previously receiving a pension from my Department. In addition, a further 8,022 pre-1953 pensions have been awarded to persons previously in receipt of a <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory or retirement pension at a personal weekly rate of less than £48. To date, this brings to 12,322, the total number of people who have benefited from the new pension. It was originally estimated that some 3,000 persons would qualify at a cost of £7 million. In effect over four times that number qualify for this innovative scheme introduced by the Government.</P>
      <P>Cases arise where a person who has claimed the pre-1953 pension and satisfies the qualifying conditions is better off financially remaining on an existing pension or qualified adult allowance. Where this occurs, the person is advised of the position. To date, a total of 360 claims have been withdrawn for this reason.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> In this age of equality is it fair that women who have the qualifying number of contributions are told they will not get the pre-1953 pension simply because their husband paid contributions? I am aware the idea of two pensions is always used as an excuse. Why should women who have paid their contributions be penalised because their husbands paid contributions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned I will endeavour to change the system of contributions <Col N="545" /> to assist those women who have taken time out of work to care in the home. That is an historical problem going back decades where such things discriminated against women. Over the last four budgets I have made substantial changes in this area to ensure more women qualify for pension on reaching pension age. This change which gave people entitlement for pre-1953 stamps was resisted by previous Ministers of every party. As a result of this change it was estimated last year that 3,000 persons would qualify. In fact, 12,300 persons already qualify. The largest proportion of those qualifying are female. A substantial number of people who have left our shores and live in England qualify for this special rate pension. As far as I am concerned it is one of the best initiatives brought forward by this Government on top of the many initiatives we have introduced since coming to office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all the Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to deal with this issue with regard to the foot and mouth disease outbreak in Great Britain where the situation is deteriorating on a daily basis and posing a growing threat to Ireland. The House will recall the first outbreak of this disease was confirmed in Essex in the south east of England on 20 February last. Since then, cases have been confirmed at 15 other locations throughout Great Britain, including one in Anglesea today. I understand other suspect cases are under investigation in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said repeatedly, I am acutely aware of the potential risk to Irish agriculture and the economy generally from these developments, in particular, the cases in Anglesea and Devon. The disease is highly contagious and we have taken a range of measures to avoid the enormous econ<Col N="547" /> omic consequences of an outbreak here. These measures have been introduced in such a way as to address the areas of greatest potential risk and these have been enhanced as the situation evolved. I assure the House that whatever further actions may be required will be taken.</P>
    <P>The measures taken up to today include a temporary ban on all imports from the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and deer and a range of animal products from such animals from 21 February. Staff from my Department throughout the country were put on alert last Wednesday while arrangements were made with the Garda Síochána and the Army authorities for appropriate resources to be sent immediately to the Border areas. Advice notices were issued to the industry last Thursday on the implications of the ban. Last Friday, a voluntary ban was imposed on livestock marts in Border counties and on hunting. Advice to the general public on the disease and its implications were included in extensive versions of week-end newspapers and staff of my Department were on duty over the weekend to assist the public. Since 1 February, imports of live sheep from Great Britain have been monitored and the sheep will now be slaughtered. Arrangements were put in place from the outset to ensure disinfection of vehicles and people occurred at entry points. These arrangements were enhanced over the weekend and significant resources have now been diverted to ensure disinfection arrangements are properly enforced. I believe this is now the position at all relevant entry points. Advice is being given to the general public on specific areas in relation to the measures required to minimise the risk of introducing the disease. Yesterday, a temporary nationwide ban was announced on sales at livestock marts and controls on the importation of used farm machinery from Great Britain. Today, the Minister announced a series of additional measures in light of the deteriorating situation in Great Britain. With effect from midnight tonight, the importation of horses and greyhounds from Great Britain will be banned. This measure will not apply to Northern Ireland for the time being. There has been strong advice to the Irish Rugby Football Union to postpone until further notice the Ireland <i>versus</i> Wales Six Nations international rugby match scheduled for Saturday, 3 March, together with the A and under-21 internationals and all associated matches between Irish sides and Wales over the coming weekend. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is also requesting the IRFU to advise Irish rugby supporters not to travel to Wales this weekend. The IRFU shares the Minister's concern regarding the foot and mouth outbreak in the UK.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also requested that all horse racing, including point to point events, and all greyhound events be cancelled until further notice. He has advised that Irish horses and their connections do not travel to the forthcoming <Col N="548" /> Cheltenham racing festival and that Irish racing followers do not attend the festival. There are requests to the Irish Kennel Club to cancel any working farm dog classes in their forthcoming St. Patrick's Day Dog Show.</P>
    <P>The foregoing represents a comprehensive range of measures to address the real threat of introducing foot and mouth disease here in view of the developing situation in Great Britain. I appreciate that many of the measures will cause inconvenience and regret that they must be taken as a major part of the effort in which we are all engaged. Given what is at stake, I am fully confident the co-operation of all will continue to be forthcoming, giving immediate effect to these or whatever other measures may be required. We will not succeed without the co-operation and commitment of everyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that the statement he has just made and the account he has just given of the measures being taken, beginning last Wednesday, constitutes a policy of a graduated response? Will he agree that is appallingly inadequate given the gravity of what faces us? Will he tell me why, if his Department staff, in his own words, were put on alert on Wednesday and various advices were given on Thursday, it was possible for parliamentarians from the UK to arrive here on Saturday and to come through Cork Airport without anything being said to them about the need for disinfection? Will he tell me why it was possible, for example, for an Irish person to go hill walking in Northumbria last week, fly from Leeds to Dublin on Sunday and come through Dublin Airport on his way home from Northumbria, where there have been several outbreaks, without being advised of a need to talk to anyone from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development at the Dublin Airport? Will the Minister of State tell me if every truck that arrives in the country from the UK is disinfected, if the drivers are told not to bring in food products and if the officials inspecting the trucks are satisfied they know what is in the trucks and where they have been? Is it the case that cars arriving here by ferry not only have their wheels disinfected, for all the good that is, but that any passengers in the cars are invited to have their footwear and clothing disinfected? Will he agree that if he cannot say, as he surely cannot, that all these things have been done, the response so far has been appallingly negligent, appallingly casual and utterly out of keeping with what is required in the current circumstances?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to play our role in doing all we can to support the Government. Does the Minister of State agree that to ensure a co-ordinated response to this extremely serious issue, the Government must establish a task force under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach? The Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Foreign Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Public Enterprise and Tourism, Sport and Recreation should be involved. The British Prime Minister is chairing a similar task force in England.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State take emergency powers to ensure that the disinfectant regime at the ports is compulsory? At present it is of a voluntary nature. This is critical. It is no use disinfecting the outside of a car when the driver and passengers are unaffected.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister has announced a ban on horse and greyhound race meetings with effect from tonight. He has also encouraged people not to travel to Cheltenham and has called on the IRFU to cancel the forthcoming rugby match. Will the Taoiseach show good example to all citizens this weekend by cancelling his planned trip to Wales? Example is very important. We must send the right signals to the public. It is no use invoking a sense of national spirit if the Government is not prepared to lead. To date it has not led with a set of co-ordinated measures to respond to this national emergency.</P>

All the Departments are aware of the action they need to take to help prevent the disease from taking hold.</P>
      <P>I have never seen such concern among the non-farming public. Last night on television jockeys complained about their loss of wages if the Cheltenham races were cancelled. The reaction of non-farming people was very critical because they were aware of the serious implications if the disease takes hold and spreads.

      <P>Any person entering a port who has been near or in contact with livestock or farming has a moral duty to this country to make a necessary declaration and have their clothing and luggage disinfected. It is also up to all Members of this House to encourage them to do so. The greatest danger of the diseases spreading is through people.</P>
      <P>It is possible that 20,000 to 30,000 people from Ireland will travel to Cheltenham and 20,000 to 30,000 will attend the rugby match at the weekend. Given the likelihood that some of these will play in and attend matches in the valleys and glens, there could be serious implications. I am delighted with the response we have been getting from the IRFU. It is a pity that some of the travel agents do not make refunds as a gesture of their goodwill.</P>

      <P>Those of us who spoke on this very serious issue in the House last week accepted the Minister's word and offered our whole-hearted support. The Minister announced the closure of marts in the Border area, yet nobody advised the district veterinary officers or the mart owners. Are we to be totally dependent on what we read, see or hear in the media or is there a commitment to ensure that this very serious disease does not come into the country?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has been told about what happened at Cork Airport. Similar stories have emerged from Dublin Airport. The Minister of State inspected some of the Border checkpoints, but he must admit that the measures taken are not adequate. I agree we depend on the goodwill of the public but we must be aware that rogues will not want their business to be found out. Given this, is there anycommitment to address this issue properly and methodically? Is the Department using the telephones, faxes and Internet to communicate with those whose co-operation we need?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will we ensure that Northern Ireland is excluded from restrictions applying to the rest of the UK and that the island will be treated as one unit? Apart from photocalls what steps have been taken since last week? What other steps have <Col N="552" /> been taken since we last met, other than photocalls with the Minister from Northern Ireland, to make sure Northern Ireland is taken out of the UK's structures so that this island can be isolated? How many trucks and cars come through Anglesey every day? Are we sitting on a time bomb? Will we do something about this? From the information I have seen and from what I have learned from others, this Government and the Minister need to take this much more seriously.</P>

      <P>I appreciated the Deputy's support last Wednesday but I think he will acknowledge I pointed out then that the Border has always been a difficult area to control. We have reduced the number of official points along the Border to 30. The Deputy will be aware of the long history in that area in regard to unofficial roads. That is why the Army and the Garda Síochána were called in to ensure trucks were channelled through official points only. Many trucks were turned back during the week. We are receiving strong co-operation from the Northern authorities in relation to the traceability of animals which may have come in here from 1 February onwards.</P>

Will he outline what additional staff have been placed at ports and airports to deal with this issue because I am sure they will have had to raise their level of activity since last Wednesday? Will the Minister indicate the numbers of additional staff, whether gardaí, Army personnel or veterinary officers? </P>

When the notification to which the Minister referred that comes over the airwaves on airplanes people are asleep, they do not pay attention to it or they are busy getting their bags ready to get off the airplane.

We have distributed leaflets in various parts of the airport asking people to check. All these precautions have been put in place. I do not think there is anybody in Britain or Ireland who is not aware of the seriousness of the situation. The Aer Lingus notice is very strong on this occasion and it should register with people that they were near a farm or otherwise and that they should report it immediately. Those are some of the measures we can take to stop this disease coming here. Additional measures are being taken tonight.

        <b>:</b> Is the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain following the BSE disaster an occasion not only for the immediate emergency measures which are critical and which the Government needs to step up very sharply, but for a major analysis of the modern methods of agricultural practice, including what food animals are fed and the patterns and extent of animal movement world-wide. Is the Minister aware that the British Government's chief veterinary officer stated that the most likely cause of the outbreak was infected swill which was fed to pigs, swill which may have contained infected meat imported into Britain? Does the Minister agree this is a further twist on the BSE crisis which was caused by feeding meat to vegetarian creatures? Does he agree that the unprecedented movement of live animals and meat imports on a world-wide basis makes transmission of serious infections inevitable? Does he agree there is now a need, apart from immediate measures in this area, for a rigorous reappraisal of agricultural practices in regard to whether the food fed to animals is appropriate and natural to their diet? Does he agree there is a need to develop local food sources for animals and to minimise live animal trade in order to prevent highly infectious diseases? Does the Minister agree that it is ludicrous that ships transporting sheep from Ireland to Britain and <i>vice versa</i> pass each other in the middle of the Irish Sea? There is a need for a rationalisation of trade to minimise the spread of infectious diseases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is a type O disease which has come in from Borneo, South Africa, Kazakhstan, Georgia etc. It is the only type of disease which exists in those areas although it is a total mystery how it got into the UK. The disease is airborne and can also be carried by people which has resulted in its transmission up to 300 miles in the UK, a fact which is extremely worrying for us. I have confidence in the type of feed which Irish farmers are giving their animals and in Irish farm produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the voluntary ban to which he referred is now totally inadequate and does not represent a sufficiently strong response? Will he ensure that a mandatory ban is imposed? Does he accept that some people are not aware of the seriousness of this disease? People are coming through our airports and are <Col N="556" /> not being stopped or cautioned to ensure they are disinfected. That was certainly the case last Saturday. I accept that the number of people at issue may be small. Will the Minister respond to the calls made by the IFA, as late as today, for tougher restrictions and to similar calls from Mr. Denis Brosnan and food industry spokespersons? Will he ensure that rugby fans do not travel to the weekend game or will he continue to invoke a voluntary ban in regard to people travelling from Ireland to Britain to attend sporting events?</P>
      <P>There is a need to re-evaluate the trend towards centralisation policies in agriculture which have resulted in abattoirs becoming bigger, animals travelling further for slaughter and mileage increasing in general in regard to the transport of products and animals. Does the Minister agree there is a need to re-examine that trend, notwithstanding the regulations to which he referred, and does he agree there is a further need to re-evaluate the trend towards the globalisation of agriculture which has resulted in a relaxation of national border controls and points of entry? Does he agree that this disease is a warning sign that we must halt this trend and re-evaluate what will be good for Irish agriculture and society?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the voluntary ban or cancellation of sporting events, the Deputy will be aware that a Supreme Court decision on the free movement of people could create some difficulty in this area. Over the past two days, the IRFU has been extremely conscious of what could happen and I commend it on its concern in this area and on holding discussions with my Department. I believe the IRFU will cancel this weekend's match and ask its supporters, who have arranged other matches around the main match, not to travel to Wales. I spoke to a considerable number of people today who contacted the Department asking whether they should travel. Our advice to them is that they should not. However, we cannot stop people from travelling. The IRFU and its supporters are adopting a responsible attitude in regard to the match's possible postponement.</P>
      <P>The decision on whether to proceed with Cheltenham is a matter for the English Jockey Club. I do not believe the races will proceed because they would not be the same without Irish horses and supporters. Moreover, the exclusion zone is getting nearer to Cheltenham.</P>

      <P>It is clear from the Minister's response that what we have is an <i>ad hoc</i> approach <Col N="559" /> and not a co-ordinated response. Would he agree that the problem at Dublin Airport illustrates the importance of establishing an interdepartmental task force under the Taoiseach's chairmanship to co-ordinate a strategic response to the crisis? Would he agree that 11 million cattle in the UK with 57 million people and 7.8 million cattle here with 3.5 million people demonstrates the relative importance of the industry to us? Would he agree that the task force I suggest is now required to deal with this immediately? Would he also agree that it is important that Members of this House lead the way in demonstrating how important it is not to make any unnecessary visits to Britain. Will the Taoiseach lead the way this weekend by cancelling any proposed visit to Wales? Will he give that undertaking to this House? Would he also agree that the only effective way to reduce risk, as Deputy Upton rightly says, is to stop people travelling even if we have to go to the Supreme Court? Where the national economy is at stake, does the Minister agree that these steps, however drastic or inconvenient must be taken? There is no use in crying when the milk is spilt, and spilt it will be if we do not take the proper co-ordinated measures necessary under a task force chaired by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach was in constant contact over the weekend with my Department and other relevant Departments on this matter, and right up to Question Time today. Effectively, the whole Cabinet is involved. The Deputy does not need to emphasise to us how important the industry is. It is of three times greater importance to us than it is to any other EU country. The Deputy is correct in saying that people should not travel. Unfortunately, and the Deputy knows why, we cannot stop people from travelling. However, we are delighted with the response from horse owners and trainers who say they will not go to Cheltenham. We are also delighted with the response of commentators in the racing world who say they will not go, and with the response this morning of the chairman of the new Irish Horseracing Authority who says they should not go. I am particularly pleased at the fantastic generous response of the IRFU who said they do not wish to go to Wales and do not want supporters to either. That is the sort of response we would like from individuals, that they will not travel to a farm or such place in Britain.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say if special further measures are being contemplated given that an outbreak of foot and mouth disease has been confirmed only a few miles from the port of Hollyhead, one of the most important ports for passenger and goods movement between the UK and Ireland? Will the Minister say if there are any <Col N="560" /> discussions between the Administration here and the Administration in Northern Ireland about treating this issue on an all island basis? I understand that First Minister Mr. Trimble said his Administration does not have the jurisdiction to take the kind of action in relation to ports that we need to take here. Is the Government undertaking any consultations with Mr. Trimble, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the London Government to see if we can treat this on an all island basis? We all recognise the difficulties to which the Minister has referred, in controlling movement across the Border. Does the Minister agree that Deputy Sargent's prescription of returning to local production for local needs, the Douthwaite doctrine, would beggar this country?</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that the co-operation of the Northern officials and authorities has been tremendous, particularly when we wanted to trace trucks that had gone through Northern Ireland and come to the Republic, notably in the instance of the first truck. The UFU in Northern Ireland has been extremely anxious to emphasise that the island is disease free in this respect and in regard to brown rot on which they have been in contact with us on many occasions to stop the importation of seed potatoes from Scotland. It is unusual that the Northern Ireland authorities would seek such a ban.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that we should compliment the Garda and the Defence Forces on the manner in which they swiftly sealed the Border. People told me they were given limited advice and instruction from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. We should extend good wishes to two gardaí who were seriously injured while trying to prevent illegal crossings. Will the Minister accept that a number of days, perhaps three, passed before proper disinfectant bays were put in place? This seriously impeded the duties the Garda and the Army were expected to carry out. Without being insulting, will the Minister of State accept, or is he even aware, that foot and mouth disease is spreading across Britain like wild fire ? Is it not time, therefore, that the Minister of State moved from requesting to invoke the powers invested in him to banning all international sporting events until this epidemic passes?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister clarify when the disinfectant regime will be in place at airports? On a chat show this morning, I heard of a person who came back from Newcastle upon Tyne late last night, having been only four miles from an outbreak. He stated there had been no disinfectant regime at Dublin Airport of which he could avail. A great deal of attention is focused on ferry ports and the volume of traffic back and forth. Does the Minister recognise that we have extensive business with the UK at commercial ports which operate a roll-on, roll-off system? What disinfectant regime, if any, has been put in place at such ports? My understanding is that nothing is happening there at present. Will the Minister indicate if there are sufficient quantities of disinfectant available? Concerns have been expressed that there is not enough of this basic component.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Boylan for his acknowledgement of the Garda and the Army, and we send our good wishes to the members of <Col N="562" /> the Garda who were injured in the course of their duty. We could ask, or insist, that international sporting events here be cancelled, but we cannot do that in another jurisdiction outside our control. I believe that the public, in other countries as well as here, will support such cancellations, and that the Welsh authorities will be as responsible as us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Durkan asked about control measures. All animal movements have been stopped. Last week, the Department immediately cancelled all meetings relating to the REP and farm retirement schemes. The IFA and the ICMSA cancelled their meetings. Many other meetings that were to take place have been cancelled. We have asked people not to gather in great numbers, and that Irish race meetings, including point-to-points, be called off. That includes next Sunday's meetings, and any point-to-points around the country. We want to show how seriously this is being taken by everyone, and we believe the desired response will be forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's management of this disease has been based on the hope that Britain will eradicate it. It has believed the problem will finish in the United Kingdom. We have lost a full week of important work. Can we expect every local newspaper to have a front page advertisement this week, dealing with the prob<Col N="563" /> lems that are besetting everybody, including the rural community? Can we take it that this has happened all over Ireland this week?</P>
      <P>I agree with the need to keep down the numbers of people travelling. Many Irish farmers, 140,000 of whom are in the eye of the storm, do not know the directions from the Department. The Ministers from the Department have not said what type of disinfectant will kill off this disease, or at least help to prevent it. Such technical advice has not been provided because the Department has been hoping the problems will remain in England. The Government has been caught offside on this issue, and rural Ireland is not confident it has a handle on it.</P>

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.00 p.m.; and (2) the Second Stage of No. 6 shall be taken today, and the following arrangements shall apply; (i) the opening speech of the Minister for Finance and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 45 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed 20 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be supporting the Order of Business, either under the heading of the late sitting or the second item and, therefore, I suppose I might as well take issue with the late sitting. We still want the Taoiseach to come into the House and explain Deputy Ned O'Keeffe's resignation. We want the Taoiseach to answer questions and until he does so, I cannot agree the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>A second issue has also arisen which I might take simultaneously. Dúirt an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Éamon Ó Cuív, go raibh díomá an tsaoil air, go raibh an t-uafás oibre déanta aige san áit in a raibh sé. Whatever about his disappointment about being moved from his job, he further stated:</P>
      <P>I don't know what this new brief means. Maybe there is something great in it that I don't see yet . . . but as far as I can see there is neither function nor funding in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the Taoiseach appointing such a reluctant hero to a job which has neither function nor funding? Will the Taoiseach come in here and, in explaining Deputy Ned O'Keeffe's resignation to our satisfaction, also explain the reshuffle and the inappropriateness of putting a person into a job in which he sees no purpose <Col N="570" /> and in which he believes there is neither function nor funding?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not extraordinary? Surely the Taoiseach sees the necessity to make a full statement in the House about Deputy Ned O'Keeffe's resignation and about the subsequent appointment of Deputy Coughlan, which had the universal approval of the House, and the step-aside appointment of Deputy Ó Cuív, who is reluctant to cover the non-functions with the non-budget with which he has been supplied?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not be agreeing the Order of Business for the reason that we have repeatedly asked for the Taoiseach to come into the House to make a statement on this matter. I have been in order, Sir, in requesting under Standing Order 31 that an invitation be extended to the Taoiseach to make such a statement in the House but that request was not allowed. I asked a Private Notice Question on the same matter and it was not allowed. I tabled a question to the Taoiseach to the effect that, following the number of meetings or telephone discussions he had with Deputy Ned O'Keeffe between 1 December 2000 and 17 February last, if he discussed with Deputy O'Keeffe the possibility of him being moved from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to the position of Minister of State at another Department, the outcome of any such discussions; and if he would make a statement on the matter. That question has not been accepted by the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
      <P>We have tried in every way that is orderly to have the Taoiseach come in and explain to the House what has happened. If the Taoiseach is reluctant to so explain, perhaps he might arrange for his programme manager to come into the House and explain. He seems to be capable of speaking more directly than the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>It is difficult for the Opposition to agree to the Order of Business when the crisis relating to agriculture and food seems to be following the Taoiseach, as well as Deputy Ó Cuív, in and out of office. The Taoiseach must try to end this matter by coming in and explaining clearly and fully what happened and how we go on from here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>What action does the Taoiseach intend to take arising from the ISSI report on Newtown House where during the watch of this Government children have been badly treated, have suffered injuries, including one boy having his leg broken when physical restraint was used. Physical restraint was used on occasions when cases could have been de-escalated by more sensitive handling. Specialist therapeutic services were very hard to get for children and appointments could take up to six months. Health board social workers, many of whom had good relations with the children, were not given sufficient access to information about the children when at Newtown House.</P>
      <P>A health board investigation into complaints about physical restraint was inadequate. As the ISSI investigated over 20 such homes and reported Newtown House as the worst, is the Taoiseach concerned about activities in other homes? As this is not something from the distant past, has the Government a proactive policy on it and what steps will it take to ensure other incidents are dealt with fairly and that proper secure accommodation is provided for children at risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State responsible, Deputy Hanafin, has prepared a very comprehensive statement on this issue. I will, however, reply to Deputies Noonan and Quinn.</P>
      <P>This is a worrying report. It highlights a number of areas of serious concern at Newtown House &ndash; the centre is now closed. The chief executive officer of the health board, the body with statutory responsibility, is to take urgent action to address the findings of the report and ensure they do not happen at this centre, if re-opened, or any other such institution again. Resources have been made available, through the health board, for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report clearly demonstrates the importance of having an independent inspectorate. When the Government established an inspectorate last July, the Minister of State requested the inspectorate to carry out this report. She has <Col N="574" /> expressed her concern that the report indicates that good child practise was not followed in a number of instances.</P>
    <P>The matters, as referred to by Deputy Noonan, took place. Children admitted to residential care have experienced a great deal of adversity and difficulty in their lives and that is why, almost without exception, they are placed in such homes. It is important that vulnerable children receive services of the highest quality. That obviously did not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a script, I merely have a copy of the press release and some notes of my own which are in the public domain and were placed on the record of a committee of this House this afternoon.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has asked the health boards to report on the arrangements they have in place to safeguard the rights of children in residential care. I have asked the Minister &ndash; if I might reply specifically to Deputy Noonan &ndash; to ensure such circumstances do not apply elsewhere. The health board is currently carrying out investigations and the Minister of State has also asked the East Coast Area Health Board to take urgent action to address the findings.</P>
      <P>A sum of £90 million has been invested in child care services. The resources for this year alone provide for the recruitment of between 600 and 700 staff in this area. We all know this has been an under-resourced area. Of the 4,000 children currently in care, approximately 3,500 of them are in foster care and approximately 100 of the remaining 500 are in need of very dedicated treatment, assistance and care. It is a recognised fact that the therapeutic aspects of this care have not been available to the extent required.</P>

      <P>That issue is being addressed through the resources being made available.

The Minister of State has had extensive discussions with the university system in an effort to improve this situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter is correct, resources provided for this area have not been good. Newtown House was used in the first instance because proper resources were not made available.</P>

      <P>A sum of £90 million has been invested in this area for child care services. In 1997 there were only 17 places, while now there are more than 70. There will be 120 places by the end of the year. The findings of the disturbing report on Newtown House have to be dealt with and rectified, and the Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for child care are determined to do this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Newtown House is the old Trudder House, which was closed because of the sexual abuse of children in care? Newtown House, the renamed Trudder House, which was supposed to provide high quality care for children at risk referred to it by the courts, has been closed because of the physical abuse of children. This did not happen in the dim and distant past from which we can learn; it happened during the Taoiseach's watch over the past year and a half-two years. What is going on in the child care section that as we go into the new millennium a child can have his leg broken by being restrained? The story of the Department of Health and Children is that the Minister for Finance is supplying the money. However, there seems to be no result on the ground. This does not date from the 1950s or 1960s; it happened during the past year or two. It is absolutely appalling and there must be a stronger response than what the Taoiseach has given us. There must also be a stronger response than the one given by the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin.</P>
      <P>There are other homes which are subject to inspection &ndash; more than 20 homes are inspected. I thought the drift of the interview with the spokesperson on radio this morning was that while this was the worst case and had to highlighted and acted on immediately there were also questionmarks over other residences. There must be a fuller response than, &ldquo;we will deal with it&rdquo;. I ask the Taoiseach to say if time can be allocated in the House at the earliest possible date so that this matter can be debated more fully.</P>

      <P>On a separate matter but related to health, today's newspapers report that Mr. Patrick Plunkett, a consultant in emergency medicine, has resigned from the board of St. James's Hospital. He cited in his letter of resignation the following:</P>
      <P>I cannot reconcile the conflict between my needs to advocate on behalf of my patients, who represent the oldest, most socially and financially deprived and the sickest amongst our community, with my responsibility for running an organisation which is, to all intents and purposes, overstretched to the point of lunacy.</P>

      <P>&mdash;fortunately not to be constrained by a lack of resources. Yet after effectively four years we have this problem. What managerial intervention is the Government going <Col N="577" /> to take to address the problems which led to a consultant resigning in this manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the consultant also stated that elderly patients were kept on trolleys for hours on end before being assigned beds in wards? Is he also aware that the chaos in accident and emergency departments is not confined to St. James's Hospital and that the hardworking and dedicated staff in Beaumont refer to its accident and emergency ward as Calcutta, people are left on trolleys for up to two days and patients are sent home because consultants believe they are safer there than in the hospital? These patients are admitted subsequently for tests when the pressure is off the accident and emergency department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the details relating to the individual consultant so I will comment on the case. St. James's Hospital is one of our most modern hospitals. An enormous amount of capital and equipment have been put into the hospital. According to any account of the health services, it is a fine hospital.</P>
      <P>The resources for the health services have been practically doubled and approximately 70,000 additional patients are seen in hospitals. However, there are still issues which need to be addressed, and there will be an opportunity to do this during the debate later this evening. It is clear that the problem is not a lack of resources and that there are other issues which must be looked at, for example, the manpower services of the Department of Health and Children. The report on staffing in the Department of Health and Children has recently been completed. There is a strategy programme which will be implemented over the next five-seven years, while working groups are looking at casualty and accident and emergency departments, beds and specialities to see what additional measures must be taken. More will have to be done.</P>

Nobody is disputing that resources have been allocated, but what is the Taoiseach doing to ensure that they are effectively and efficiently employed? The Government has been in office for almost four years. These problems have not suddenly arisen overnight and the Government is not constrained by a lack of resources. Is there a managerial lack of intent? Why can the Taoiseach not get Ministers and Departments to roll up their sleeves? As Deputy Noonan said, there is clearly an emergency in many hospitals. Will the Taoiseach accept that simply saying resources have been made available and that there is a strategy programme in place &ndash; welcome and all as they are &ndash; does not address the problem?

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 20 February 2001 I replied to Adjournment matters raised by Deputies Jim Higgins and Denis Naughten on railway accidents at Kiltoom level crossing. Deputies Higgins and Naughten challenged the accuracy of part of my response. This response was based on information received by my Department from Iarnród Éireann and was accepted by me in good faith.</P>
      <P>The part of my response which was questioned by Deputies Higgins and Naughten was as follows:</P>
      <P>The previous incident to which the Deputies referred occurred on 22 December and involved a passenger train which collided with one of the gates at the level crossing. A formal inquiry was established in this instance also. Iarnród Éireann has advised that the immediate cause of the incident was a failure by the driver to stop short of the gate. The inquiry was investigating whether there were underlying causes of the incident, but this has been suspended pending the completion of the inquiry into the latest incident. The Minister has been advised that the driver involved in the incident has been retrained and disciplinary action against him has been instigated.</P>
      <P>In the light of comments by Deputies Higgins and Naughten, I asked my Department to urgently clarify the matter with Iarnród Éireann. I am advised that the following sequence of events has been confirmed by Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incident occurred on 22 December at approximately 15.55 hours. Immediately following the incident the Iarnród Éireann district manager in Galway was contacted. He requested the district traction executive in Athlone to go to the scene. The district manager also spoke to the driver by radio. The district traction executive interviewed the driver at the scene and, in consultation with the district manager, permitted the driver to continue to Ballina. The train driver was accompanied in the cab of the train for the remainder of the journey to Ballina by the district traction executive and also on the return empty <Col N="586" /> train to Athlone. Iarnród Éireann has confirmed that it is standard practice for the local manager to carry out an investigation into the immediate cause of an incident as soon as possible, but certainly within 24 hours of the occurrence of an incident. Iarnród Éireann has notified my Department that this took place after the incident of 22 December. However, I now understand that the driver has, through his solicitor, been in contact with the company regarding this matter. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this particular aspect.</P>
    <P>In early January, the district manager commenced collecting data for consideration at a formal internal inquiry. This is evidenced by internal Iarnród Éireann correspondence dated 4 January and 24 January. The letter of 24 January makes specific reference to the information being required in order to proceed with the inquiry into the incident of 22 December at Kiltoom level crossing. On 16 February, after the most recent level crossing accident at Kiltoom earlier that morning, the district manager fixed a date of 23 February for the holding of the formal internal inquiry. Iarnród Éireann has advised that it is usual in such cases to have an intervening period between an incident and the actual holding of a formal inquiry in order to facilitate the collection of background information by the company.</P>
    <P>In my reply last week I referred to the fact that the Minister was advised by Iarnród Éireann that the driver was retrained. I now understand the retraining took place when the driver was accompanied by the district traction executive, a former train driver, on the journey from Kiltoom to Ballina&mdash;</P>

      <P>Last week I also referred to the fact that the inquiry into the December incident had been suspended pending the completion of the inquiry into the most recent incident. I have <Col N="587" /> ascertained that this is factually incorrect. The company has since advised that this was not the case and that it was never intended to suspend the inquiry, rather the company intended to convey the message that the inquiry had been overtaken by the incident at the same location, which took place on 16 February. The message appears to have become confused in the flow of the large amount of information between Iarnród Éireann and my Department in the short time available to enable a full response to be made to the motions.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the response I made in the House last Tuesday was based on information provided that morning by Iarnród Éireann to my Department and was given by me to the House in good faith.

    <Title>Finance Bill, 2001: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to put before the House my latest Finance Bill. This builds on and develops measures taken since I became Minister to ensure we have a tax system that facilitates growth in employment and prosperity. The budget and Finance Bill deliver Government commitments on personal taxation and contain various measures to tackle inflation. This Bill will introduce innovative new measures to promote savings and encourage donations as well as providing for significant structural changes arising from the move to tax credits, the change to a calendar tax year and the conversion to the euro.</P>
      <P>The income tax and capital gains tax year will, from January 2002, correspond with the calendar year. This change is long overdue. The 6 April start to the income tax year is a leftover from the 18th century. From January 2002 we will also be operating in euros. The change to the calendar year, the short tax year this year and the conversion to euros require extensive revisions throughout the tax code and these are contained in this year's larger than usual Bill.</P>
      <P>I will now outline the main contents of the Bill. The Committee Stage provides the opportunity to debate the detail of the Bill. I will listen with interest to the contributions from Deputies.</P>
      <P>Sections 2 to 4, inclusive, set out the main personal tax changes announced in the budget. The increases in basic personal allowances, or tax credits as they now become, are set out in section 2. Section 3 provides for the reductions in the standard rate of tax from 22% to 20% and in the higher rate from 44% to 42% as well as for an increase in the standard rate band. Section 4 increases the income tax exemption limits for persons aged 65 years or over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 and the First Schedule also reflect the move to a tax credit system. This is the final step in the move to convert standard rated allowances <Col N="588" /> into tax credits. As part of the simplification process, permanent health contributions will be given on a net pay basis similar to superannuation contributions. Section 2 and the First Schedule also reflect the transition to the calendar year and the euro in relation to personal tax credits.</P>
    <P>Section 7 increases the allowance for family members who employ a carer to look after an incapacitated relative from £8,500 per annum to £10,000 per annum. Section 8 changes the rules for claiming medical expenses in respect of a dependent relative. Currently medical expenses relief can be claimed only in respect of a relative where the claimant qualifies for a dependent relative allowance for which there is an income limit. Alternatively relatives had to use covenants to achieve a similar result. In future taxpayers will be able to claim medical expenses relief directly for designated relatives. The restriction on relief for routine maternity care is also being removed. I also intend to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to bring expenditure on educational psychologists and speech therapists for children within the relief. I indicated in the budget that I favoured providing tax relief for insurance products geared at providing for future care needs. I will introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to provide for this.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is new and recognises the role of trade unions by providing a flat rate allowance of £100 at the standard rate of tax in respect of trade union subscriptions. This provision will have effect from 6 April 2001 but the Bill provides that the amount for the 2001 year will be added to the amount for the 2002 tax year and the total allowed in 2002 to facilitate the administration of the credit in the introductory period. Section 13 amends the ESOT legislation to allow an ESOT trust to give either shares, or cash if the shares are encumbered or the holding period has not expired, tax free to the estate of the deceased's beneficiaries. Until now such a payment or transfer would have given rise to a tax charge.</P>
    <P>The appropriate tax treatment of share options has been the subject of significant discussion over the last few years with arguments made for and against giving tax relief. I have weighed the issues carefully and I consider the arrangements put forward in section 15 provide a good balance between the objectives of facilitating the participation by all employees in the fortunes of the company for which they work and of helping companies retain staff vital to their success in a difficult international and national labour market. This section will change the tax treatment of share options where they are granted under an approved scheme so that the benefit is taxed at the CGT rate of tax rather than at the taxpayer's marginal rate of income tax.</P>
    <P>For a share options scheme to qualify for this tax treatment, it will, as with other employee share schemes, have to be approved by the Revenue Commissioners. Schemes must be open to all employees on similar terms. However, schemes may incorporate a key employee <Col N="589" /> element which does not meet the similar terms conditions provided at least 70% of the total amount of share options is made available to all employees. There will be a requirement for a retention period of at least three years between the time the option is granted and the time the shares are sold by the individual. There will be no limit on the amount of shares that can avail of the tax treatment.</P>
    <P>The Bill as published provides that the new scheme will apply to share options granted on or after 15 February 2001 provided the scheme is subsequently approved by the Revenue Commissioners and would have met all the conditions applying at the time of grant and exercise. It has been put to me by various industry representative groups and individual companies that it would facilitate staff retention if those employees who had share options granted before 15 February 2001 but had not yet exercised them were eligible for the new tax treatment provided, of course, that the scheme under which the options were granted met all the other conditions. I see the benefit of this approach and I intend to bring forward a suitable amendment on Committee Stage to provide for this.</P>
    <P>Section 16 amends certain provisions relating to retirement annuity contracts. For ease of administration and to prevent any tax leakage, the Bill provides that annuity payments will be subject to deduction under PAYE from 1 January 2002. Where a person contributes to a contract for dependants or for life assurance, there is, within the overall limit of relief, a limit of 5% of net relevant earnings on the tax relief for these contributions. The Bill provides that the splitting of the overall tax relief in this way will be abolished. Individuals will still be free to contribute to a RAC for their dependants. Contributions to the contract for the dependants and contributions to the main RAC will now simply be aggregated and subject to the overall tax relieved limit for contributions to retirement annuity contracts.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 to 21 deal with arrangements for introduction for tax relief at source for medical insurance relief and mortgage interest relief. Section 17 also extends the coverage of medical relief to cover premia for primary health care. My recent initiatives in moving certain reliefs to a tax relief at source system are aimed at relieving some of the pressure on the tax administration system and at the same time making life a little easier for taxpayers claiming those reliefs. Under relief at source the correct relief will be given up front, there is no annual paper chase and generally no need to contact the tax office to get the proper relief due. From April 2001, medical insurance relief will be given at source. From January 2002 mortgage interest relief will also be dealt with in the same way. This is a simple and efficient method of channelling these tax reliefs to the persons who wish to avail of them and will help to ease the burden on an over stretched tax administration system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> With the aim of increasing the supply of child care the 1999 Finance Act introduced an exemption from benefit-in-kind tax to employees in respect of employer provided child care. Section 22 amends this to allow the exemption for schemes where employers are involved in financing but not managing the facility. In such circumstances the exemption will be restricted to cases where the employer provides financial support for items of capital expenditure and equipment but not other costs. Where the employer is involved in the management of the facility, the current financing conditions will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides for the amalgamation of the existing tax relief for third level education fees and for standardising the conditions that apply. Various restrictions which currently apply to the reliefs will be removed and the relief will be extended to postgraduate fees paid in the US and other countries not covered by the existing scheme. This is something I undertook to look at for this year following requests on Committee Stage last year.</P>
    <P>A special allowance of £5,000 per annum is currently available for seafarers. Section 27 reduces, from 169 to 161, the number of days a seafarer is required to be on voyages to or from a foreign port in an EU flagged ship for the purposes of claiming the allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 28 closes an existing loophole in the foreign earnings deduction relief by amending the definition of a day for the purposes of this relief. The section also inserts an expiry date for the scheme of 31 December 2003 allowing for a review of the scheme before any extension is agreed.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 and 30 deal with measures to help ease our current housing pressures. There are many homes where the possibility exists of spare accommodation being rented out. A barrier is often the fact that such rental income is taxable. Section 29 introduces a new &ldquo;rent a room&rdquo; scheme. Where a room or rooms in a person's principal private residence is let as residential accommodation and the gross annual rental income is less than £6,000, the rental income will be exempt from tax. This will not affect full entitlement to CGT relief on one's principal private residence in the event of a subsequent disposal of the property or full entitlement to mortgage interest relief. Section 191 provides that room rental coming within the scope of this scheme will not trigger a stamp duty clawback.</P>
    <P>The Government's objectives are to increase housing supply to meet the hugely increased need for housing, to tackle house price inflation and to give the first-time buyer a chance in the market. The Government has taken a range of measures over recent years to ensure this and I do not need to enumerate these. The Government is also concerned to ensure there is a supply of good standard accommodation in the private rented sector. The Bill provides for various tax incentives announced by Government arising out of the <Col N="591" /> recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector.</P>
    <P>Section 30 restores the relief for interest on borrowings to purchase, improve or repair certain rented properties converted into multiple residential units before 1 October 1964 under certain conditions. The tax relief will apply to the tax liability on rental income only. Section 77 provides for CGT rollover relief to be made available to landlords where the proceeds of a sale of rented residential property are reinvested in new accommodation. It will be a condition that the reinvestment property must contain at least as many residential units as the one disposed of, with a minimum of three units to apply in any event.</P>
    <P>An amendment will be proposed on Committee Stage for a general 100% capital allowance over seven years against rental income in respect of capital expenditure on the refurbishment of rented residential properties. Taken together these measures should help to improve the standard of accommodation in the private rented sector and provide an incentive for investment in this sector.</P>
    <P>In introducing a stamp duty rate of 9% and the 2% anti-speculative property tax for investors last summer the Government undertook to keep the matter under review. We have now decided to reduce the rate of stamp duty for investors in new property from a flat 9%. The new rate will be 3% for properties up to £100,000 and the same rate as for non-first time owner occupiers for properties above that. The investor rate for second hand properties will remain at 9%. I can provide a table of the new rates.</P>
    <P>The Government considers that this reduction will provide an incentive for increasing supply in the new built rented sector while leaving the relative position of owner occupiers and investors in the second-hand market unaffected. In this context, it should be noted that approximately two thirds of first time buyers buy second-hand houses. This stamp duty change will also increase the attractiveness of tax incentives for student accommodation which are new-build. This change will apply to conveyances made on and from today.</P>
    <P>The Government has also decided not to proceed with the anti-speculative property tax due to come into effect next April. In the light of developments in the housing market since last summer the Government does not consider it necessary to go ahead with this measure, which would, in any event, have applied in practice to a very limited category of investors. These changes will be implemented by amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. Given these changes the Government does not now propose to introduce section 23 relief for targeted groups.</P>
    <P>Sections 34 to 37 make changes to the capital gains tax code and double taxation relief provisions following the decision of the European Court of Justice in the St. Gobain case. As a <Col N="592" /> result an Irish branch of an EU resident company will be given the same credit against Irish tax for foreign tax suffered on the same income as would be given if the branch were an Irish resident company.</P>
    <P>Section 38 is an anti-avoidance provision which amends the rules for the valuation of stock for tax purposes at the discontinuance of a trade where the stock is transferred from the trader to another trader with whom the first trader is connected.</P>
    <P>Section 39 provides for the extension of exemption from dividend withholding tax to a number of new categories of shareholders such as incapacitated individuals who are exempt from income tax in respect of the investment income from personal injury compensation payments. In addition, Irish resident subsidiary companies will be able to pay dividends free of DWT to their Irish resident parent companies, without the necessity of the parent company making a formal declaration to the subsidiary.</P>
    <P>Section 41 introduces a new uniform tax relief scheme for donations. This will involve merging almost all existing reliefs. The new relief will be available at a taxpayer's marginal rate of tax for both personal and corporate donations. The minimum donation which can attract relief will be £250. There will be no upper limit on the total amount of relief afforded to individuals or companies. The relief will be available for donations to all beneficiaries under the existing schemes which are being merged, including those for Third World charities. It will apply to donations to all charities which have tax exempt status for three years and to first and second level schools and third level institutions. This represents a major expansion in the relief, for example, for personal donations to domestic charities and educational establishments. I am very aware of the enormous sound contribution made by charitable donations in the United States, triggered by their tax relief arrangements. We have a tradition of voluntary effort and charitable donations in Ireland and this should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>For ease of administration, it is envisaged that the tax relief for most taxpayers will be paid by Revenue to the body receiving the donations rather than paid to the donor. Individuals on self-assessment will claim the relief and companies will make the deductions as if the donation were a trading expense.</P>
    <P>Sections 42 to 44 provide for an extension of the existing general 25% general stock relief for farmers and the special stock relief of 100% for certain young trained farmers from 6 April 2001 until 31 December 2002 subject to this being in conformity with EU state aid rules.</P>
    <P>Section 45 amends existing legislation so as to provide for standard capital allowances to be available for non-domestic users who make capital contributions towards water supply infrastructural capacity provided by local authorities.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's policy in introducing the new regime for taxi licences, it was <Col N="593" /> announced that the existing taxi licence owners would be able to write off the actual cost to them of these licences as a capital allowances. Section 46 provides for: a write-off period of five years; a write-off period for taxi licences backdated for three years to 21 November 1997 or the commencement of trade, whichever is the later; the write-off to be allowed against the trading income of the licence owner who drives a taxi and against both the trading and rental income only where one licensed vehicle driven by the licence owner is also rented out on a part-time basis. I indicated that I would look at specific cases of hardship where some modification of this scheme would help and I intend to bring forward some amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 47 provides for the write-off period for the annual wear and tear capital allowances for plant and machinery to be shortened from seven years to five years. Up to now the allowances operated on a straight line basis over a seven year period, that is, 15% in the first six years and 10% in year seven. This measure takes effect for expenditure incurred on or after I January 2001 and applies both to the general plant and machinery capital allowances as well as to capital allowances for business motor vehicles, excluding taxi and short-term hire vehicles which retain their 40% reducing balance arrangement.</P>
    <P>Section 50 provides for the measures on taxation of credit unions which I detailed in the budget. Credit unions will also be able to operate the new savings scheme which I will be introducing on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Sections 51 and 52 deal with changes to the relief for park-and-ride facilities, multi-storey car parks and the rural renewal scheme. Relief for qualifying commercial premises located at park-and-ride facilities is being restricted to facilities that provide local services only. This is to conform with requirements arising under EU state aid rules. Eligibility dates for qualifying expenditure are being extended under the multi-storey car park arrangements. Upper limits in the total floor area for qualifying houses under the rural renewal scheme are also being increased in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's mismanagement of the health services despite the taxpayer contributing unprecedented levels of funding and in particular in its failure to:</P>
      <P>provide fair and equitable access to health services;</P>
      <P>reform the administration and governance of health services;</P>
      <P>make the structural and staffing changes necessary to eliminate hospital waiting lists;</P>
      <P>provide for current and future medical, nursing and therapist manpower needs;</P>
      <P>provide additional hospital beds;</P>
      <P>relieve the chronic overcrowding in hospital accident and emergency departments;</P>
      <P>make proper and timely investment in primary care;</P>
      <P>provide medical cards for those on modest incomes;</P>
      <P>develop and provide positive mental health programmes;</P>
      <P>and calls on the Government to immediately address these deficiencies and in particular to ensure:</P>
      <P>the appointment of a health ombudsman;</P>
      <P>the creation of a covenant of rights and responsibilities for patients and health care providers, overseen by the health ombudsman;</P>
      <P>the provision of adequate support services to allow older people to live in dignity and independence in the community; and</P>
      <P>the setting up of an independent inspectorate of both private and public nursing homes.</P>
      <P>It is wholly unacceptable that 30,000 people, many of whom are in pain, are currently on waiting lists for hospital treatment while thousands of others are in a queue to see a consultant so that they can get on the waiting lists. Such long lists do not exist is any other European country and the advent of such lists in Ireland is a relatively recent phenomenon. In spite of the millions of pounds spent on so-called waiting list initiatives, the Government has singularly failed to put in place the broad range of measures necessary to reduce such lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been in office for almost four years but, in spite of various PR announcements and significantly increased spending, the health services are in a state of crisis. Those who can vote with their feet take out private health insurance while those who cannot live in fear of getting sick or, worse, live in pain as they await treatment. The core problem with the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government <Col N="595" /> approach is that it has created an apartheid system.</P>
    <P>To listen to the Minister for Finance and, indeed, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, last Friday night, one would be forgiven for thinking that a fortune is spent on our health services. While health spending has increased in recent years, we still spend considerably less than our European neighbours, a fact borne out by our poor life expectancy. In 1980, Ireland spent 8.7% of its GDP wealth on health. By 2000, Ireland's spend had dropped to 5.1% of GDP or 6.05% of GNP which is probably a fairer measure. While it must be acknowledged that Irish GNP increased rapidly in recent years, Ireland is nonetheless 22nd in a list of 29 OECD countries in terms of health spending. From a low base in the early 1990s, health spending has more than doubled but it remains far behind the European average of more than 8% of GDP. Part of the reason for health spending in Ireland being below the EU average is explained by the population's young age structure. However, this is changing.</P>
    <P>The state of the nation's health and the question of access to treatment when it is required are the key issues of concern. An essential element of Fine Gael health policy is the proposal to increase resources closer to the EU average and to put structures in place to make health spending more efficient. Resources will be provided on the basis of need. We will also ensure that health services are provided in a more egalitarian way and that services paid for by the public purse, currently amounting to over £5 billion annually, which we intend to significantly increase when in government, will be accounted for to the citizen in a more professional and proactive way.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael does not apologise for proposing to spend an additional £300 million on primary health care and an additional £500 million on secondary care annually, targeted at specific objectives aimed at creating a more effective and fairer health service. We do not want this funding to be swallowed up in the system. We propose to spend £190 million specifically to meet private insurance costs currently borne by taxpayers on an individual basis. Fine Gael proposes to introduce a universal and uniform health system. The total extra cost of our proposals in a full year would be £990 million.</P>
    <P>We also advocate management and accountability reforms to ensure that the extra funding will not simply be consumed by current structures. We intend to immediately increase spending on medical card entitlement by £130 million. In addition, we propose to allow doctors and pharmacists a 100% investment tax write-off for capital expenditure on surgery-pharmacy improvements which the health authority certifies as expenditure which will ease pressure on hospitals. We also propose a once-off spending of £10 million to clear the backlog of waiting lists for home-based aids for the elderly &ndash; hand-rails, <Col N="596" /> shower fittings etc. &ndash; and £10 million on research into mental illness. Fine Gael has given serious consideration to how the system should be reformed and where funds should be targeted.</P>
    <P>We further propose productivity audits which will realise additional resources to be retained within the health services. Fine Gael's spending proposals would increase health spending to 7.52% of GNP or 6.34% of GDP on a year 2000 basis. This would still not reach European levels of health spending as a proportion of GDP or, indeed, previous Irish levels. We believe that spending on non-salary benefits for taxpayers will assist in easing pay demands and inflationary pressures. In any case, this spending is justified in its own right.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes a legislative basis for health policy so that members of the public will know their entitlements and will not be dependent on the whim of administrators or others, as evidenced by the administration of the nursing home schemes by the health boards.</P>
    <P>If the scandal of waiting lists is in itself a horror story, the state of the nation's health is equally horrifying. Ireland has the highest rate in Europe of death from heart disease. At almost twice the EU average, heart disease is responsible for about half of all deaths here. One third of all those who die in Ireland aged under 65 die from cancer. Ireland has the third highest death rate from cancer in Europe and many of those who die are awaiting so-called elective treatment. We can improve our health treatments in these areas while ensuring that such medical advantages as Ireland enjoys are maintained and built upon.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael estimates that almost £1 billion of additional annual spending will be necessary to fund its ambitious proposals. However, we are only too well aware of the evidence given by the Department of Health and Children to the Committee of Public Accounts that almost 60% of the extra spending on health from 1994 to 1999 was for pay costs. That is why we set out in our recently published document a new strategic approach to health services with six specific proposals for performance measurement in the section on healthy governance. We also propose greater accountability and tendering procedures for hospital management contracts to ensure greater productivity. We propose three yearly productivity audits of all hospitals and health services paid for from the public purse to ensure that, for example, laboratory procedures or radiology services are modern and efficient and contribute to necessary medical information being readily available.</P>
    <P>We note the case made by the Department's chief medical officer in his 1999 annual report which suggested that the debate about health services should be widened to a debate about health itself and health inequalities in particular. This is not simply a debate about money. As the chief medical officer pointed out, health is a fundamental human resource, something to be invested in which is inextricably linked to social and econ<Col N="597" /> omic progress. We agree with him that we should place the promotion of health and, in particular, the narrowing of inequalities of health experienced by different segments of our population at the centre of all our efforts at social and economic development.</P>
    <P>In the Ireland of today, you will live longer and in less pain if you can pay, but those on low incomes must suffer on. This is unjust, unacceptable, and untenable and runs counter to the principles of a just and inclusive society which the Government allegedly espouses. We must end this double standard. A comprehensive, modern and high quality health service must be available to all, based on fair criteria, not the size of a person's bank balance. In its policy document Fine Gael commits to the provision of such a service and sets out proposals for bringing it about. We will return to the citizens' trust in the health services. It has been eroded because our citizens are not confident of being appropriately treated when ill. Major health care services and providers have not justified the trust placed in them. The poor, the elderly and other patients suffer second class treatment or worse, receive no help when they need it. There is a glaring of lack of leadership and direction by the Government in its fourth year in office in solving the problems in the health care system.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael plan is designed to restore trust in the health services. For this reason &ndash; and others set out in our policy document &ndash; we will create a citizen centred service which will be trustworthy, effective, efficient and accountable to the citizens it is designed to serve. Under our plan, health care will be funded to meet the needs of our population, fundamentally reoriented, needs led and outcome-driven.</P>
    <P>We propose a thorough reform of the way the health services are governed, with a White Paper on Health followed by legislation to replace crisis management with strategic planning, a major investment in primary health care including pharmacy and preventive medicine, and a targeted extension of the medical card general medical service (GMS), doubling the income limits for qualification as an immediate measure. We will extend free GP services to children up to the age of 18 years, and beyond if in full time education which is not uncommon throughout the European Union, we will also include senior citizens over the age of 65 years and those in the lower 60% of income group. There will be special provision for asthma sufferers and those with similar chronic disabilities. Asthma will be included in the long-term illness scheme. Access to secondary care will be on the basis of need through a tax funded universal health insurance scheme. Secondary care will be reformed with identified priorities.</P>
    <P>Hospital management contracts will be reformed with new, specific performance measurement criteria which put health gain and fairness first. Citizens' and voluntary organisations will have a role in health administration and there will <Col N="598" /> be productivity audits throughout the health service. We will establish a covenant, not just a charter for display, between providers of health services and patients which puts the patient first and is reported on annually. Specific funding commitments will meet these objectives.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael reforms will constitute the biggest change in health care delivery since 1947 when a separate Department of Health was established. We do not underestimate the enormity of the task, but recognise its importance and of early, comprehensive reform. The method of implementing reform will be a matter for detailed discussion involving a White Paper followed by legislation. It may be prudent to initiate reform on a rolling basis rather than to introduce a nation-wide change all at once. Subject to agreement by the bodies concerned, they will be piloted in two or three health board regions and extended to the rest of the country on a phased, programmed, decisive timetable over two years. This will allow later regions, as well as the insurance companies and the Department of Health, to benefit from the earlier experiences, and plan accordingly.</P>
    <P>These radical and comprehensive reforms are rooted in the principles of equity, quality, and cost effectiveness. They are being formulated when our health services are at breaking point under the strains of an outmoded structure. They are analogous to reforms undertaken over the past ten years or more in virtually every other European country. They are distinctive, taking account not only of our own cultural and philosophical values but also benefiting from the experience of those countries ahead of us in reforming. In contrast to this radical plan, the Government, as exemplified in its amendment to the motion, congratulate themselves on their PR announcements but fail to deliver on the ground.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some facts underlying the health service. There are 30,000 on waiting lists and thousands more waiting to get on lists. There are reports, forums, initiatives, but still no sign of the large increase necessary in consultant numbers. We have an under-funded, under-resourced general practice system on the point of collapse with doctors' representatives threatening industrial action. The childhood immunisation scheme has scandalously low levels of uptake. In some areas more than one in five children have not been vaccinated against measles. The system of blood collection is in crisis and patients face the prospect of cancelled operations due to insufficient supplies. The inadequate medical card scheme leaves people on the minimum wage ineligible for treatment and in some cases they have to choose between food and medical care. Excellent strategy documents, such as that on cardiovascular disease, have not been implemented. For example, the recommendation to make nicotine replacement therapy GMS reimbursable has not been implemented two years after the report was published. A further recommendation to remove tobacco from the consumer price index has been <Col N="599" /> blocked by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. Instead of real action, we see sponsorship of snooker matches with lovely pictures of the Minister and &ldquo;the good news&rdquo; Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Four years into Government, Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats, look to develop a new health strategy. Let them face the facts &ndash; they have neither the courage nor the imagination to develop and implement such a strategy. Fine Gael in contrast, has developed such a strategy which puts patients and their needs first, rather than one which seeks to fit patients' needs into outdated and ineffective current structures and practices. The Fine Gael plan for health and health service reform is at the core of our aspiration for a just society. It empowers us to meet the challenge of providing quality, affordable and appropriate health care for all. It is a plan for the nation.</P>
    <P>Let the Government implement this plan or stand aside and let us get on with the job. There is no worse service delivered in such an unfair, unjust and apartheid-ridden way as our health service has been for the last four years. If we are not prepared to reform this system &ndash; to move it into the 21st century &ndash; for the poorer people who suffer most, let us think of ourselves. How would any of us like to be old and frail, or to fall on hard times and put our children at the mercy of this system which is chronically ill and needs the chronic, urgent, overwhelmingly reformist and integrated attention it has not been receiving? We have put forward our proposals, as have the Labour Party, to be fair. This Government, after four years in office, is only now coming up with a plan as it faces into an election. I have no doubt it will be indicted by the people when it goes before them. It will be found guilty when its mandate runs out at last in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, on the production of an absolutely excellent health document. Irrespective of the politics involved, one can see that a huge amount of effort and thought was put in over a wide area. I am disappointed that the Minister, despite the resources of the Department of Health and Children, has failed to come up with an overall strategy for the health service. The whole thing seems to be breaking down. When questioned about poor services, the Minister says more money has never been invested, which is true, relative to what was invested in the past. It is also true that there has never been less value for money. There is more aggression and complaints and less confidence among the vulnerable in society than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that elderly people do not want to go to hospital. They try every trick in the book not to go, which is unsurprising, as it is a job in itself to get admitted to most hospitals. It takes at least four or five hours, and often over 12 hours, to get through the admissions section. Not only do we want more funding in the health service, we also <Col N="600" /> want more value for money. I sincerely hope that more will be done for GPs, who are highly committed to their patients. With a little imagination, it should be possible to ensure that their services lead to fewer people going through hospital outpatient doors, which would be hugely important.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to a topic I have previously discussed in this House, which is the closure of the Bon Secours hospital in Tuam. This is another example of the glaring omissions in the health service due to a lack of strategy. For several months, it appeared the last thing the Department and the Western Health Board wanted was a community hospital in Tuam. As the hospital is closing on 5 April, I hope the Minister will guarantee the people of Tuam a replacement hospital. Tuam cancer care used the services of the hospital to good effect down through the years, which means that a number of patients will be discommoded in the next couple of weeks. I hope that the Department and the health board will look after them until the new community hospital is planned and up and running.</P>
    <P>There is a good psychiatric service in the Bon Secours hospital. One day a week, over 30 outpatients come there, it is a service which benefits the area generally and I am informed there is nowhere for them to go after 5 April. I hope the Department and the Western Health Board will ensure that these 30 people are well looked after in the Tuam area. They should not be moved somewhere else, as they are used to coming to Tuam. It is incumbent on us to ensure that arrangements are made long before 6 April. I sincerely hope there will be an early announcement regarding what the Department of Health and Children will do in Tuam.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Gay Mitchell for bringing this timely motion before the House. The Minister must realise that access to health services is becoming more difficult for ordinary people. It is difficult to understand how the Minister can stand idly by, while acknowledging there is a two-tier health system. I cannot understand how the Minister can justify a young schoolgoing child having to wait four years for orthodontic treatment. Nor can I understand the Minister's justification of a terminally ill person in casualty in University College Hospital, Galway, last week having to wait for a bed from midday on Thursday until midday on Saturday, when they were finally admitted. This person was taken care of in a cubicle by their family and spouse. If the Minister stands over this situation in the <Col N="601" /> Celtic tiger Ireland of 2001, then he needs to ask himself some very serious questions.</P>
      <P>I believe that reports, assessments and photocalls are no substitute for action on the ground. The Minister and his predecessor in this Government have failed to take meaningful action to rectify and readjust the health services over the last four years, so that people in need have access. The Minister will probably say that additional funding has been provided, which nobody can doubt. This additional funding has been thrown at the problem, while no effort was made to solve it. The Minister has not used his authority to bring changes about.</P>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, I wish to bring an ongoing problem to the Minister's attention. When will Portiuncula hospital be given over to the Western Health Board so that the uncertainty of the last few years can be eliminated? The hospital always had a good ethos, but morale has been low and will continue to decline unless the Minister indicates, as a matter of urgency, when he intends to take over the hospital and restore it to its proper place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the state of our health services be brought to the Minister's attention. The Taoiseach made a comment on the Order of Business that sums up this problem. He boasted about the large amount of money being spent on our health services and the major increase in the moneys in question. That is beyond dispute, as the figures speak for themselves.</P>
      <P>The other side of the equation is that queues for hospital treatment are lengthening and more and more people are crying out for a health service that does not appear to be readily available to them. Whatever about the financial side of the Minister's management of our health services, from an administrative point of view, there are serious problems. I am sure every other Member is given details daily of people awaiting admission to hospital, who are crying out for a health service that does not seem to be there. More and more people suggest that in today's Celtic tiger economy, the state of a family's health is becoming more and more dependent on the size of that family's wealth. That is unfair, immoral and should be tackled by the Minister.</P>
      <P>While no Minister has had more financial resources available nor has any Minister invested more money in the health service, the Minister, the Minister of State and the civil servants in the Department must ask what is wrong. Something is wrong from an administrative point of view when the queues for hospital treatment are lengthening at a time when more money is being provided. An audit of how that money is being spent is urgently required. In today's Ireland, if one can pay, one will live longer and have less pain, while those on low incomes must suffer on. That is the type of double standard that should not be accepted and is not necessary in a modern European economy such as ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> There are 31,000 on the waiting list for hospital treatment. That is only the official waiting list, there is also the waiting list of those awaiting an appointment with a consultant. I am sure the Minister would not attempt to defend those figures, but it must be asked how those lists can be so obscenely long at a time when more and more money is being invested in our health service.</P>
    <P>Our party spokesperson, Deputy Mitchell, produced a worthwhile document, Restoring Trust in the Health Service, and Deputy McManus brought forward an interesting, informative and impressive document on our health service on behalf of the Labour Party some months ago. Ideas on how to address the problems have been put forward, but the Minister's approach to tackling the 31,000 on the hospital waiting list appears to suggest that the money invested in the health service will solve the problem. It has helped, but it has not made the problem go away.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot justify the state of the health service. Some patients are being left on hospital trolleys because beds are not available, 31,000 people are on the official hospital waiting list and there is a lack of health services available to the elderly while more people are losing their entitlement to a medical card. What new steps does the Minister intend to take, as investing money alone has not worked and will not work? Has the Minister asked himself, how that money is being spent and the value for money of such investment? We are not getting value for money from that investment, as my constituents and other citizens have decided they are not willing to accept a second rate health service in a first rate economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this motion. I compliment my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, on tabling it and on the work he did in providing an excellent health policy document on behalf of Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>I agree with much of what my colleagues said. I have articulated two specific issues and I would like to hear the Minister's view on them. We have a two tier health system. The majority of representations made by constituents who call to my clinics concern the health service. Most of those constituents are waiting for more than a year to be called for a medical procedure and, in most instances, they cannot afford to pay for private health service. The Minister is lucky the Government is in a position to invest a good deal of money in the health service. I do not question that nor the Ministers for Finance and Health and Children securing money for the health service. I question how that money is being spent and that this issue has not been dealt with in a period when a good deal of money has been available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics given by two consultants on an RTE radio programme two years ago highlight a problem that no political party has addressed. I do not know who will address it, but doing so would be one of the ways this problem would be resolved. In 1969, 95 administrators administered the <Col N="603" /> health service in the greater Dublin area, I am told that today there are 11,000 administrators in the Eastern Regional Health Authority set up on the Bill introduced two years ago. That is where the vast majority of money is being spent in our health service. The number of administrators in the health service throughout the country is great. I note the Minister's adviser is shaking his head and probably saying to himself that those statistics are not correct, but they were given on an RTE radio programme two years ago. That official is an administrator. I have no difficulty with that, but a great deal of the money being spent is not getting through to the forefront of our health service. It is not being spent on providing extra beds, recruiting more nurses and doctors or appointing more consultants. The money is not getting through to the coal face which is where there is a serious shortfall.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could resolve part of that problem under his watch as Minister for Health and Children, he would go a long way towards reducing the hospital waiting list. The additional money that has been spent on the health service in recent years has not resolved that problem. Therefore, there is a difficulty. One of the problems is the high administration cost of the health service.</P>
    <P>Another fact given on that radio programme was that in the greater Manchester area, which is similar to the size of Dublin, there are about 3,000 administrators in the health service. That contrasts greatly with the many more administrators in our health service. The high administration cost of the health service is difficult to accept and must be dealt with urgently.</P>
    <P>There is a need to provide medical cards for those on modest incomes. The income thresholds that qualify a person to hold a medical card have not increased much in recent years. The Government must examine that qualification criterion on the basis of gross income rather than net income, as the number of people who no longer qualify for a medical card has increased dramatically, particularly in the North Western Health Board regions, especially in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim. Many of my constituents have told me they are no longer entitled to a medical card, as their income has risen above the qualifying threshold income. Given that the income threshold for qualification has not increased, those people have been taken out of the system. That is not right and it is contributing to the development of a two tier health service.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the setting up of an independent inspectorate of private and public nursing homes. That must be put in place as matter of urgency. A number of complaints have been made concerning nursing homes and the establishment of a independent inspectorate is the way to proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>commends the Government on its commitment to provide a high quality health service directed at those most in need and acknowledges:</P>
    <P>&ndash;the dramatic increases in current funding since 1997 to the health services made by the Government compared to the previous Administration;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the provision under the national development plan of £2 billion in capital funding which will transform the health infrastructure;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the Government's strategic approach to planning for the health system, in particular the launching of significant major strategies, such as the children's strategy, the cardiovascular strategy and the national health promotion strategy;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the Government's strategic and reforming approach in regard to the work now under way in areas like the reform of the medical structure advocated in the report of the Forum on Medical Manpower, the review of bed capacity in the acute hospitals and the pending review of primary health care;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the Government's commitment to the preparation of a new health strategy which will make recommendations on how best to implement a high quality, equitable and accessible health service; and</P>
    <P>supports the Government in its approach to modernising the health system through the development and implementation of strategies underpinned by solid investment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate and thank members of the Fine Gael parliamentary party who supported Deputy Mitchell's motion and for giving me and my colleagues the opportunity to discuss health policy. The Opposition has asked the House to condemn the Government's record on health in a broad motion. A broad response is, therefore, required.</P>
    <P>As it has dramatically demonstrated in recent weeks, the Opposition is driven principally by the whim of the latest opinion polls. Having thrown overboard its recently reaffirmed leader, the Fine Gael Party has stated that it is willing to change any policy and say anything in its attempt to scramble back into government. As it appears likely that it now has in place the leader who will bring it into next year's general election, it has resumed the desperate search for issues which will perform the political alchemy of converting the base metal of its record and policies into something more alluring to the electorate.</P>
    <P>As has been demonstrated again, the leadership may have changed, but the basic tactics remain the same &ndash; never explain one's record, <Col N="605" /> pretend one was never in government, never make a hard choice, pretend there is an easy answer to every problem and, when in doubt, play the man, not the ball. We continue to hear much from the Opposition parties about their commitment to openness and transparency. It is in that spirit that I suggest to the Labour Party and Fine Gael contributors to this debate that they take the opportunity, which they have declined to take for the last four years, to explain the reason Deputies Quinn and Noonan chose to cut back funding for the reduction of public waiting lists in 1997. They might also explain where their health reform agenda was when they were in a position to do something about it.</P>
    <P>As I have said many times in the House, the Government is proud of its investment in the health service. It is proud of the reforms to the service which it has implemented and has confidence in its programme for the rest of its term. These stand in dramatic contrast to the disinterest and neglect of those who now present themselves as the answer to the ills of the health service. We are proud of our record. I am aware that the leader of the Fine Gael Party is proud of his record in the Department of Health and Children and that the leader of the Labour Party is proud of his record in the Department of Finance. Together they aspire to persuade the people that the Government should be condemned for our record &ndash; so be it.</P>
    <P>I will set out the progress made since the people chose to change the Government. I will also outline our proposals for the rest of our term and how, taken with our record to date, they add up to an unprecedented programme of investment, modernisation and reform of the health service. While much has been achieved, much more still needs to be done. Central to further progress is a Government which is concerned with the reality of action, not just the empty rhetoric of superficial, opinion poll-driven empathy.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting directions the Opposition's policy has taken in recent months has been to stop basing its attack on the Government on the idea that it is refusing to allocate resources to the health area. On countless occasions the Government was attacked for not putting enough into health. Having looked increasingly threadbare for some time, the motion signals a formal surrender on this point by acknowledging the &ldquo;unprecedented levels of funding&rdquo; the Government has provided for health services.</P>
    <P>The scale of the increase in resources has been dramatic. The House will be aware that the health service received just under £2.5 billion in the rainbow Government's last full year in office. With a last minute spurt, that Government managed to increase its year on year average increase to around 7%. This was the record it brought before the people and which they rejected. This year, the Government doubled the rainbow Government's funding through an allocation of approximately £5 billion. This demonstrates yet again that for all the effort the Opposition puts <Col N="606" /> into trying to demonise him, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has looked after the health service much better than his predecessor.</P>
    <P>Before the argument about newly available resources is used, we should not forget there was no fiscal crisis in 1997. It was the rainbow Government's choice to cut funding for reducing public waiting lists. Deputy Quinn's party has confirmed that it believes in running budget deficits. I remind the Fine Gael Party that Deputy Noonan claimed on budget day last December that the Government had provided for too much spending this year. In the light of the huge proportion of Government spending which now goes to health, the only reasonable construction we can place on this is that he is of the view that we are spending too much on health.</P>
    <P>The new Opposition attack is based on the idea that the Government is throwing money down a drain and achieving nothing for those who need services. The Government has chosen to dramatically increase health spending. We will defend this decision because it is delivering on the ground. There is much more to be done, but it is having an impact. With 3% and 8% increases respectively in 2000, the extra funding meant that 50,000 more day cases and almost 40,000 more in-patient cases were dealt with in our hospitals than in 1997. These 90,000 extra cases were not dealt with by accident, but because the Government is committed to funding and reforming the health system. In addition to these improvements, there are more health professionals employed in our hospitals than at any time in our history. For example, there are over 400 more doctors in place than in 1997.</P>
    <P>A sustained expansion in public investment is an essential building block for a world-class health system. It has been shown year after year that the Government is providing the required investment. It is also pushing forward a wide series of initiatives to develop and implement meaningful and lasting reforms. Given the problems we face, it is too easy to divorce them from domestic and international contexts, particularly in relation to progress being made. Significant advances are being achieved. Services are improving, but as they are not yet good enough, we must continue with an aggressive programme of reform. Some want to stand at the crossroads and sell an easy elixir, guaranteed to cure rheumatism, gout and the ills of the health system in return for one vote for a bottle. The people are not that foolish and we are confident that they will respond to a record of investment and a credible reform programme.</P>
    <P>At the heart of any successful health system are the professionals who work within it. There is no doubt that our system has not had an effective means of developing, using and acknowledging the skills and dedication of many professionals. This has led to various problems, particularly in the context of a tight labour supply in society, but matters are improving significantly. One of the key initiatives in this area is the Medical Man<Col N="607" /> power Forum. The forum was established to address issues relating to the medical staffing of hospitals. Agreement has been reached on the principles and approaches to be adopted in relation to the main service, training, research and career issues affecting medical staff. It has also been agreed that the introduction of these changes should coincide with an extension of the core hospital working day. This will require an increase in the current number of hospital consultant posts and significant change in the way hospitals work.</P>
    <P>The key outcomes from the implementation of the report of the forum will lead to the provision of a better quality service, with greater continuity of patient care, delivered 24 hours a day by appropriately trained staff. The proposed increase in consultant numbers will be coupled with a rationalisation of the number of doctors in training. The report recommends major changes to medical training in order to retain medical graduates and accommodate the needs of women who wish to combine medical careers with family commitments.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the report of the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors are closely linked to the report of the medical manpower forum. The report is the result of a major study of the hours worked by NCHDs and a blueprint for reducing these hours to 48 hours per week. The thrust of the report will mean the employment of more hospital consultants which will lead to a consultant-provided service as opposed to the current consultant-led service. The result will be improved patient care and greater access to hospital consultants in the public hospital system. This report is another milestone in a series of initiatives aimed at improving the pay, conditions and career opportunities of non-consultant hospital doctors. It follows the £90 million package announced last year which provided substantial improvements in overtime payments, training grants and associated conditions.</P>
    <P>These reports should be published shortly and I intend to move quickly to the implementation phase, including the opening of negotiations on the consultants' contract. It should be recognised that these reports will present significant challenges. The Government will consider the reports in detail with the key objective being the improvement of the quality and availability of services for patients. They will provide greater opportunities and improved career paths for doctors, coupled with greater access for public patients to senior clinical decision-making. This, in turn, will lead to more prompt treatment, more streamlined admission and discharge procedures and a reduction in waiting times.</P>
    <P>The almost 30,000 nurses who form the backbone of the health system must continue to be central to health policy. We must continue to attract to and retain and properly utilise people in a world-class nursing profession. I am glad to <Col N="608" /> report that the recent recruitment and retention initiative for nurses seems to be having a positive impact. International recruitment has attracted over 750 nurses and significant progress has been made in many hospitals. Deputies will remember that there were over 70 nurse vacancies at Beaumont Hospital at one stage last autumn. I am sure they will be pleased to learn that the number is now down to ten. No doubt the Deputies who attacked the initiative at the time will have the good grace to use the time available to them in this debate to acknowledge the progress which has been made.</P>
    <P>The last year has seen a range of fundamental improvements in the education and training of nurses. The introduction of more flexible practices, including new part-time rostering, represents a dramatic improvement in the responsiveness of the system to the personal and professional needs of nurses.</P>
    <P>Increasing the number of training places is a central plank of my strategy for addressing the nursing shortage. The number of nursing training places has been increased by 300 to 1,500 until, at least, 2002. A further 20 places have been filled on a new direct entry midwifery programme which has been introduced on a pilot basis. Over 1,500 nursing students started training in October 2000 with record in-takes to psychiatric and mental handicap nursing. This is a strategically important area where progress has been achieved, but which requires continuous attention. The same issues arise regarding other health professionals such as therapy grades, social workers and psychologists on which there is the same commitment to action as evidenced by the full implementation of the report of the expert review committee on paramedics and the necessary provision of funding.</P>
    <P>The objective must always be to ensure the public has high quality care available when it needs it. We have put in place the necessary planning procedures to identify the level of provision which required to meet this objective, while implementing a series of initiatives which meant that last year there were roughly 90,000 more day cases and in-patient cases dealt with than in 1997.</P>
    <P>We have committed to and significantly progressed the first comprehensive review of bed capacity for some time in acute and non-acute settings. The review is being conducted by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the social partners. It is of critical importance in the context of assessing the capacity of the hospital system to manage periodic surges in emergency admissions and achieve a significant reduction of waiting times for elective treatment.</P>
    <P>Funding of £32 million has been approved on foot of phase one of the review to alleviate service pressures on the acute hospital sector. This funding is being targeted at a number of key service areas and the provision of aids and supports for older people. The second phase of the national bed capacity review is under way and <Col N="609" /> involves the development of a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors. The review will also involve a detailed assessment of need, including an analysis of future bed requirements by medical and surgical specialty. It is anticipated that this phase of the review will be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>The motion makes specific reference to our record on waiting lists. If the Opposition would like to spend every day of the next year holding a debate comparing records on waiting lists, I would be delighted. At some point it might get round to explaining the previous Administration's cutback of funding for reducing public waiting lists. As opposed to this, we are providing the resources which are having a significant impact on waiting lists. We have also completed a proper in-depth study of the impact of different measures on reducing waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists are not a uniquely Irish phenomenon. They feature as part of many publicly funded health systems. Throughout the developed world health systems are experiencing similar difficulties in catering for all the demands in key specialties.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continuous reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001, following the significant success achieved in this area last year. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001. This funding has been made available to health agencies in conjunction with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative, the national bed capacity review and the winter initiative investment. I also approved an investment package of £32 million to address a number of key service issues in the acute and non-acute sectors. The investment is being targeted at a number of areas, including the provision of additional step-down facilities for patients who have completed the acute phase of their treatment. Many of these patients are older people and who require a further level of care in a more appropriate environment. Under the winter initiative, there will be an increase in the capacity of the acute hospital sector to address the problem of the inappropriate use of hospital beds and enhance the level of extended care available. It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and, more importantly, waiting times.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to the Government's policies on primary care. We have launched a range of initiatives in order to develop policy on this area, which, without going into detail, have improved the infrastructure of primary care. We have also acknowledged the need to further develop general practice to ensure it plays its full role in the strategic development of primary care and a <Col N="610" /> broader integrated health care service. It was in recognition of this that it was decided to undertake a major examination of the nature and role of general practice with the issues surrounding its development in an integrated primary care setting. The purpose of the review was to identify the measures which would be necessary to meet the challenges posed if general practice were to be properly and strategically developed.</P>
    <P>The findings of the completed review will serve as the basis for the future strategic development of general practice. Accordingly, it is intended that future investment in general practice will be on the basis of the review and involve a process of consultation with the relevant representative bodies which have prepared their own vision of the future. This will be a wide-ranging exercise and progress will be made on an incremental, but structured basis which will have full regard to existing realities of general practice organisation, infrastructure workload, etc. The evolving outcome of the process will be, therefore, a more complete and rationally developed general practice and primary care system fully integrated into the overall health care sector which meets patients' needs in a value for money framework.</P>
    <P>One of the principal policy thrusts of the Government's work across Departments has been to help older people to retain the dignity and independence to which they have a right. The rainbow Government's derisory 1997 pension increase of £1.80 has been replaced by a series of the largest increases in the history of the State pension. In the same way investment in supports and services for older people have been to the fore of the health agenda of the Government. Automatic entitlement to a medical card for all those over the age of 70 years represents a huge step forward.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to this philosophy of care is proven by the considerable injection of funding into the services which are at the heart of care in the community, namely, expansion of the home help service, specific assistance for carers, additional community support services, that is, public health nurses, care assistants, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and dieticians, with the provision of new day care centres.</P>
    <P>Additional funding for the development of services for older people has increased significantly from £3 million in 1997 to an additional £7 million in 1998, an additional £12 million in 1999 and an additional £28.5 million in 2000, while in 2001 an additional £33 million will be provided. These figures do not include additional funding for the nursing home subvention scheme or to expand medical card eligibility to those over the age of 70 years. The additional funding has resulted in approximately 880 posts approved for services for older people between 1997 and 2000. Between 1998 and 2000, over 400 additional beds have been provided in ten new community nursing units and over 1,000 day places per week have been provided in ten new day care centres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> On top of the various areas mentioned, we have undertaken and are implementing a process of strategic planning for a wide range of specialisms. These have been based on our essential approach, which is, to properly examine and strategically plan the development of services. We have worked to end the days of reactive planning. We are not interested in the empty posturing involved in pretending that there is an easy answer to every issue. We are interested in delivering real improvements and the way to achieve this is to plan properly.</P>
    <P>An additional element of this and a firm answer to the idea that all we are interested in doing is spending money is the first ever comprehensive audit of value for money within the health system. The specific remit of the review is to examine the trend in resource inputs versus the trend in service outputs to clients over the last ten years; the trend in demand for health services in the last ten years; the difference, if any, between the trend in the level of contribution to cost of public and private patients <i>vis-à-vis</i> service levels to each category; and differentials in output costs across health boards and hospitals, including specialties. Consultants have also been asked to make recommendations on the development of a management information system for the health service. The study is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>I am determined that quality will be at the centre of everything we do in the health service. My Department has been working with eight of our major academic teaching hospitals to put in place a formal health service accreditation scheme. This will be based initially on the major teaching hospitals and set standards against which hospitals will be surveyed. These standards will allow for real measurement of performance and quality improvement. Best international benchmarks will be used in what will be an independent system. I am confident that it will be a key element in providing a hospital system comparable to best international standards. The health system has required sustained expansion in public investment in a wide range of areas. We have provided this, but perhaps the biggest departure has been the inclusion in the national development plan. A total of £2.0 billion has been made available under the plan. This represents a trebling of investment compared to the previous seven year period. The purpose of the plan will be to create an infrastructure that will bring significant and tangible advances in delivering a more patient centred and accessible service. This investment represents the largest modernisation programme in the history of our health services.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment to shift the balance of capital investment towards the non-hospital sector so that the £2.0 billion is divided equally between the hospital and non-hospital areas. In the case of services for older people, it is proposed to provide a greatly improved physical <Col N="612" /> environment to ensure a high quality and client centred service. Approximately £200 million will be available for the capital development of services for older people over the period of the plan. This will allow for the provision of approximately 20 new community nursing units and 20 day care centres and for the expansion of some existing facilities.</P>
    <P>Over recent years, a significantly ambitious programme of developments has begun and is in train. We have been carrying out the work required to provide the foundations of effective plans for the future. Additional resources are delivering better care and greater access to care. Various detailed studies have given us a better understanding of the needs and failings of the system. We have now begun the next and final stage of the process, which is to bring together the different elements into an overall national reform strategy.</P>
    <P>I could spend a great deal of time responding in detail to the health policy documents launched by the opposition parties last year. However, this would not be a productive use of time. The Fine Gael document is typically a mile wide and an inch deep. It is all things to all men but ultimately a loose collection of promises targeted at a few select groups. The Labour Party has been more ambitious in presenting its simple solution of universal health insurance. The difficulty is that it is so full of holes that it has given up trying to justify it and have reverted to empty catch phrases.</P>
    <P>No doubt during the debate the Labour party will claim to be proposing real reform but no one should be fooled. Just because one claims that it is reform and it will cure the world's ills, does not mean it will do so. Deputy McManus has found increasing refuge in the sort of approach quoted in <i>Alice through the Looking Glass: </i>&ldquo;Things mean exactly as I say they mean, no more and no less&rdquo;. In spite of consistent calls for it to do so, the Labour Party has refused to answer fundamental questions about its fundamental reform.</P>
    <P>How can it claim that all local hospitals will survive if it also says all funding must be competed for in negotiated contracts? How much is it proposing to spend on administration? How much additional care will be provided under its plans? If, in every country that has tried it, universal health insurance has failed to deliver the quality and quantity of care to which we aspire, why should we want to adopt it? The answers are increasingly clear. The Labour Party's intention is not serious reform, but short-term electoral gain.</P>
    <P>What we are interested in is investment and reform of public health services. Equity, quality and accountability will be at the core of the new health strategy, on which we have begun consultations. With major professional and research issues behind us, the strategy will demonstrate again the commitment of this Government to modernisation, development and reform of our health services. The <i>status quo</i> is not an option. Serious reform of administrative, funding, service delivery and professional practices will have to be <Col N="613" /> considered where this is required to deliver a world class public health system for all who need it.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in the empty rhetoric of superficial responses. This is too important an area. The record of investment and reform which we have already established, is delivering results, as evidenced by the 90,000 extra cases treated last year. However, we have only begun to see the impact of many of the policies and investments already in place.</P>
    <P>Increased investment, detailed research and lengthy negotiations with professionals, have been the essential starting points to long-term reform. Some people think it possible to pre-empt this process and buy an off-the-shelf reform. That is not possible and any attempt to do so will simply result in a worse situation than before. The final year of this Government's term will see us developing and implementing further significant reforms. While the Opposition engages in political ambulance chasing, we will get on with the serious work of investment and strategic reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has set down the strategic reforming approach this Government is taking to enhance our health services. I reiterate the message of better strategy and considered reform to utilise effectively the massive increase in funding for health delivered by this Government. As compared with the previous administration, there has been a 100% increase in the over all spend since 1997, from £2.6 billion to £5.2 billion. The present Government's record is second to none. This increased funding is being matched by strategic policy initiatives, reviews and evaluation of health delivery, which will all contribute to a higher quality of service in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>A dramatic example of the increased targeted funding delivered by this Government to an area virtually ignored by the previous Administration, is in the area of disabilities. Spending on disability services has grown dramatically since 1997. In the case of services for the intellectually disabled, the amount allocated by the previous Government for 1995 to mid-1997 was £36 million, compared to an allocation of £205 million by this Government for the mid-1997 to 2001 period. For the physically disabled, the amount allocated by the previous administration for 1995 to mid-1997 was £10 million, compared to £107 million by this Government for the mid 1997 to 2001 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last December, we announced that everybody over the age of 70 years will be automatically entitled to a medical card. We have been the first Government to have made a real difference to the vulnerable in our society. The policy of the Department of Health and Children is to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home, in accordance with their own wishes as expressed in many research studies; to restore the <Col N="614" /> independence at home of older people who become ill or dependent; to encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies and to provide a high quality hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.</P>
    <P>As well as providing the funding for those services, we have a strategy. In planning for service developments in the next few years, particular attention is being focused on the achievement of substantial service improvements in a number of key areas. These include assessment and rehabilitation units and day hospitals; extended care and community nursing units; community based services and community support such as day-care centres and care in the home &ndash; care teams, home helps etc; palliative care services; services for older people who are mentally infirm and nursing home subvention.</P>

This range of initiatives shows the Government's commitment to the vulnerable in society and to the health of all the people. This Government cannot be faulted, given the massive extra resources it has applied to health care. This, together with the strategic and reforming agenda now being energetically pursued by this Government, will provide the results to answer any criticism. I am honoured to be associated with this Government, which is providing the funding, infrastructure and strategic policy for the further development of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Healy, Penrose and Wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the spin which the spin doctors have put on the speech of the Minister for Health and Children, one of this Government's great failures is seen on a daily basis in the chaos of our hospitals, which is growing despite economic growth and extra funding, and in the suffering and anxiety experienced by thousands of people who cannot access quality health care when they need it. The Government proclaims it is spending more on the health service, yet the overall waiting times for public patients have lengthened rather than shortened during the Government's time in office. Staffing problems, especially in Dublin, have also become more acute during its time in office. The pressure on hospital beds is worsening and dissatisfaction among the public with the health service is deep<Col N="615" /> ening. The Government is floundering while people die as they await cardiac and other operations.</P>
    <P>This is an intolerable situation which would not be tolerated in most other EU countries. The inequality which permits private patients to fast track treatment at the expense of public patients would not be tolerated in many other EU countries where access to health care is recognised as a universal right and where equality as well as quality form the basis upon which health care is delivered.</P>
    <P>I listened with amazement to the Minister attack the Labour Party discussion document. I do not mind him criticising or attacking the proposals but I object when the points he makes are dishonest. We all know that the only future for many local hospitals is if they accommodate change. The Minister has dealt with such hospitals which are in danger of closing and with services which either have already closed or will close, especially where obstetrical services are concerned. Litigation will deal with issues for many local hospitals and the Minister knows it. For him to pretend that local hospitals in certain cases will not have a future unless they learn to change and develop in a different way to survive and flourish is dishonest.</P>
    <P>We have never made any pretence about the need for change in the health and hospital services. However, it is also clear that there is not an excess of hospital capacity throughout the country. Given the cutbacks in the 1980s, it is clear that there is not enough capacity overall and that there is space for local hospitals and a necessity for them to deliver for local communities. We support that.</P>
    <P>The other point the Minister made which I found extraordinary in the context of other EU countries is that universal health insurance has failed to deliver the quality and quantity of care. A great number of EU countries have some form of insurance based system which establishes universality of care. Not one of those countries would choose willingly to have our system and give up the superb care available in France, the fast access in Germany or the capacity in Austria for the type of service we have which belongs to another era, which harms people and which does not support or deliver for them when they are sick.</P>
    <P>We should be clear what we discuss. I do not mind engaging the Minister in a debate about how to resolve the issue of inequality and the differences in quality. However, despite the fact that we have put forward honest opinions and views as to how this issue can be dealt with, the Minister has rubbished our proposals. While that may be politics, he does not have the right to do that and not to put forward his views. That is a cowardly thing to do. It does not deal with the core issue of how our system does not deliver for public patients. It does not deal politically with one of the greatest political issues facing us. It is a cow<Col N="616" /> ard's way out to rubbish proposals presented in good faith without presenting one's own. The Minister has not dealt with the core issue of inequality between the experiences of private and public patients. There is an inequity at the core of the health service and the Labour Party believes it is time to resolve it, not by levelling down but by levelling up. Fianna Fáil does not have an answer to the questions we ask about how it intends dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>A self-serving, self-congratulatory amendment has been tabled by the Minister to the motion. It is an insult to those directly affected. These people are too poor, sick, elderly or vulnerable to exert power and influence over Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. That is clear. That said, they are part of the community and they suffer at present because the system does not deliver the care they need. That is too often forgotten by a Government that has grown complacent and self-satisfied.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the motion tabled by Deputy Gay Mitchell and Fine Gael because it gives us an opportunity to speak out on these people's behalf. Many others want to speak out on their behalf, such as people working in the health service who are frustrated and angry at what is happening to patients who should be able to access care and who are unable to do so. That experience of frustration and anger is present in the health service and is palpable.</P>
    <P>We see it in a report that a consultant in one of the major public hospitals has taken the ultimate stand. Mr. Patrick Plunkett, accident and emergency consultant, has announced he is resigning his position on the board of St. James's Hospital because he can no longer stand over the mess that daily presents itself in his emergency department. He said:</P>
    <P>At 9 a.m. today, there were 18 patients in the emergency department of St. James's Hospital waiting for admission to the wards. [This is a letter he wrote to the Minister] Of these, 10 had been waiting for a bed since before midnight. Eight of them were over 70 years of age. One [of them] is over 90 years of age and has been in the emergency department for 24 hours now [waiting on a trolley to get a bed].</P>
    <P>How can we have this glorious presentation from the Minister for Health and Children? He quoted <i>Alice Through the Looking Glass</i>. I quote <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. You can have jam yesterday, you can have jam tomorrow, but you cannot have jam today. One cannot have the service denied these poor people waiting in the accident and emergency department in St. James's Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>He is trying his best but he is not succeeding. I cite another example and perhaps the Minister could do something. This is an issue I raised on the Order of Business concerning haemophiliacs. This is an area where the system failed people in a way that is almost incomprehensible. We established the Lindsay tribunal to find the truth, discover what happened and, in some way, to try to alleviate the terrible experience of these people. When discussing health care in the past, it is important to be scrupulously fair and take into account the distorting prism of hindsight. However, in the cases of the HIV and hepatitis C infection of haemophiliacs by contaminated blood products, the responsibility for the most scandalous and tragic episode in health care history lies squarely with the State. The Lindsay tribunal was established by the House to discover the truth of what happened.</P>
      <P>The Irish Haemophiliacs Society has a difficult and sometimes terrible duty to discover that truth while being conscious that some of its members face premature death as a consequence of what was done to them. The society has shown great determination and dedication. To be fair, the Minister waived his privilege and promised to provide documentation for the Lindsay tribunal. I ask him to go further. Four other institutions are withholding necessary information which they could deliver to haemophiliacs and which they refuse to do. They shelter behind privilege at a time when they should provide every support they can to these unfortunate people. It is inexcusable. The Tánaiste stated publicly yesterday that she wanted these institutions to reveal the truth.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister ask the Taoiseach to ensure these institutions comply with their moral obligation in this regard. It may not be their legal obligation to do so, we understand that. There is a moral argument that will not and should not go away. The Taoiseach is the one person who could ensure this happens. Let us remember, we are talking about the slaughter of the innocents. The health care system in this country delivered the death sentence to those who died.</P>
      <P>The Government can ensure that the Lindsay tribunal is provided with all the documentation to discover the truth. We will only have one shot at it and time is very rapidly running out for those involved in the process of discovering the truth. A very extreme example is that many of the problems in our health service, under-funding, lack of accountability and poor management, remain to be addressed now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> We have to recognise that after four years the Government has failed to deal with the same issues. Many reports have been compiled on the health services and I would like to see them, we have waited long enough. The medical manpower forum report was due about two or two and a half years ago &ndash; it is a long time in gestation. I know there were problems with it but it appears the Minister is sitting on it instead of publishing it. The real problems in the health services has to be measured by the experience of the patient who needs to be placed centre of service. The reality is that thousands of patients are on hospital waiting lists today despite the fact that the Government promised to tackle that problem &ndash; the Minister spoke about the last election, perhaps the problem is that the rainbow Government told the truth. The Government has spent a great deal of money but has achieved only minimal change in the reduction of hospital waiting lists. Fianna Fáil promised the people it would tackle the hospital waiting list problem. The reality is that not only have the lists not decreased but the waiting times for many specialties have risen. What kind of record is that? The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, said that the Government's record speaks for itself. I could not have said it better myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">

      <P>The Government's record is that people are still waiting, in their thousands, for necessary procedures, hospital wards remain closed, staff shortages have increased and morale is becoming more and more problematic. Consultants are leaving hospital boards out of sheer and utter frustration. If that is a record to be proud of, I am not living in the same country as the Minister. I would have preferred to hear an honest view presented, not the spinning of spin-doctors. I have a great deal of respect for the Minister. From time to time he tells it as it is.</P>

      <P>No, that did not happen tonight. Perhaps he does so in front of a television camera when it suits him to be a little more ingratiating. I do not know but it is an aspect of his disposition which does not reveal itself very often.</P>
      <P>What we are seeing is a sham. I ask that the Minister stop looking at this as a party political speech and look instead at the problems which exist in the health service from the patients' point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and thank the Labour Party for sharing time. The health services are in a malaise, a malaise dominated by crisis management of the services where rich and powerful people can get immediate medical treatment but public patients must wait for months and years for treatment, and sometimes they die. A symptom of that mal<Col N="619" /> aise can be seen any day of the week at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, where up to 12 patients await treatment in very narrow corridors. These are elderly and very ill patients, they have no privacy and their personal belongings remain at the end of their beds. They are left in full view of visitors to the hospital. These people are unable to receive treatment via medical equipment and the staff, medical, nursing, non-nursing and administrative, are absolutely frustrated by the situation.</P>
      <P>Similar problems exist throughout the country. The only solution is to provide additional beds. We must put back into the system the beds which Fianna Fáil took out in the mid-1980s. They closed the district hospital in Tipperary town with the loss of 50 beds. From that day on, difficulties of overcrowding arose in hospitals in south Tipperary. The mid-1980s was a time when we saw slogans such as &ldquo;Health Cuts Hurt the Old, the Sick and the Handicapped&rdquo;. Fianna Fáil was re-elected on slogans such as that. However, when it resumed office it did the opposite. We need to re-open all those beds which were closed. We need long-stay beds, more step down facilities and more district hospital beds if the difficulties are to be surmounted.</P>
      <P>The policies initiated in the mid-1980s have resulted in overcrowding and long waiting lists. There are now approximately 30,000 public patients on waiting lists in public hospitals as against 24,000 in 1994. Those policies also mean that the health spend per head of population today is about 15% lower than the European Union average. It means that the death rate from heart disease is the highest in the European Union and the death rate from cancer among women is the second highest in the European Union. Thousands of sick people are forced to travel long distances for necessary treatments which should be available locally. Local communities are forced to fund-raise for essential medical equipment. A CT scan is essential medical equipment which should be fully funded by the Department of Health and Children, but locals in Tipperary are forced to fund-raise for it.</P>
      <P>Emergency services are needed to bring access to medical services for public patients up to the same level as those available for private patients. I want to refer to the very sad and sorry situation where our elderly patients are forced into private nursing homes and are being denied their legal entitlement to public funded treatment in such homes. The recent Ombudsman's report pointed out that elderly people have a statutory entitlement to publicly-funded nursing home care. It is incumbent on the Minister to immediately bring forward legislation which will provide elderly people with their entitlement to nursing home care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 53 provides for a scheme of tax relief aimed at providing residential accommodation in the vacant space over commercial premises in the five cities Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway. The framework for the scheme provides for a range of tax incentives similar to those available under the urban renewal scheme. These are 100% relief in respect of refurbishment and necessary construction and expenditure for owner-occupiers and lessors of residential property. There is also relief for expenditure incurred on refurbishment and construction of the associated commercial property. To comply with EU state aid rules, qualifying commercial services must be involved only in local services. The reliefs will be applied to specific lengths of streetscape which are to be recommended by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the five cities covered following recommendations by the relevant local authority and approval by a special panel of experts.</P>
      <P>Sections 56 to 65 make various changes to the taxation of life assurance and collective investment funds mainly following on the arrangements introduced last year. Section 58 provides that the same tax rate will apply to investment in both Irish and certain foreign life assurance companies and investment funds. The foreign countries involved are all EU and European Economic Area countries and OECD countries with which Ireland has a double taxation treaty. Where an Irish resident receives the proceeds of such foreign investment products on or after 1 January 2001 the same tax rate will apply to such proceeds as will apply where an Irish citizen invests in an Irish life assurance company or Irish investment fund, provided certain conditions are met. Section 63 mirrors these arrangements in the case of persons who hold an interest in certain off-shore funds.</P>
      <P>The other changes largely reflect discussions with the industry and clarify issues that have arisen under the new tax regime as well as making certain changes to special investment schemes and special investment policies following on the fact that the tax rate applying to these is the same as the standard rate of tax.</P>
      <P>Capital allowances are available for expenditure on certain buildings used for the purposes of third level education. Section 66 contains an amendment so that capital expenditure on certain sports facilities associated with third level educational institutions can also benefit from these capital allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> The income tax and capital gains tax year is being aligned with the calendar year from 1 January 2002. This will involve a transitional tax period or short tax year running from 6 April to 31 December 2001. Section 67 and Schedule 2 provide for the necessary changes to the various areas of the tax code consequent on the changeover to a calendar year of assessment. The short year involves allowances, credits, reliefs, thresholds, qualifying days, etc. being reduced in that year to 74% of their full year equivalent.</P>
    <P>To coincide with the move to the calendar year, section 68 also provides for a common return filing and payment date of 31 October for those on the self-assessment system. This means that by that date taxpayers will be required to have filed their tax return for the preceding tax year and paid any balance of income tax and capital gains tax for that year, having taken credit for preliminary tax already paid. They will also be required to have paid their preliminary tax for the current year. Given these new arrangements, it is proposed to allow a margin of error in relation to computational errors. Provided the taxpayer has otherwise made a correct tax return and pays any shortfall by 31 December in that year, no interest or penalties will apply. There will also be a number of consequential changes to the rules on payment of preliminary tax and, in addition, the terms for payment of preliminary tax by the direct debit method are being made more attractive.</P>
    <P>Profits from shipping which are charged to tax at the 10% rate would, in the absence of change, be charged to corporation tax from 1 January 2001 at the prevailing standard rate of corporation tax, that is, 20% in 2001, 16% in 2002 and 12.5% in 2003. Section 69 provides for the 12.5% corporation tax rate to apply from 1 January 2001 for shipping activities.</P>
    <P>Section 73 abolishes the exemption for dividends remitted to an Irish company from its foreign subsidiaries under section 222 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, unless the dividends were certified by the Minister for Finance before publication of the Bill. Section 76 abolishes the exemption for foreign branch income and gains from tax under section 847 of that Act but only in the case of new applications for this relief. These reliefs are seen as no longer necessary for new investment in current economic conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 78 provides capital gains tax relief when a parent transfers a site to a child to enable him or her to build a principal private residence. The related stamp duty relief is provided in section 189.</P>

      <P>Section 79 removes the capital gains tax rate of 60% which was introduced in 1998 for disposal of certain residential development land on or after April 2002. CGT rollover relief is available on farmland which is the subject of a CPO for road building or road widening where the proceeds of the CPO are reinvested in trading assets within a specified time period. Section 80 extends the time period for such reinvestments.</P>
      <P>Sections 81 to 138 of Part 2 contain provisions to consolidate and modernise general excise legislation. This continues the process of updating excise law undertaken in the past few Finance Acts. Sections 139 to 141 confirm the budget day decreases in rates of excise duty in unleaded petrol and auto diesel and the increase in duty on tobacco products to compensate for the VAT reduction. Sections 142 to 147, 151 and 162 increase the maximum penalty level for conviction for summary offences from £1,000 to £1,500, the tariff now regarded as standard. Section 216 later applies this new limit to all summary tax offences.</P>
      <P>Section 512 does away with the special advance payment of excise duty in December and provides in future that all payments in respect of December must be made by the end of the subsequent month. This is the practice for all other months during the year.</P>
      <P>Section 153 provides, as announced in the budget, for a 50% repayment of vehicle registration tax in respect of hybrid electric vehicles. The scheme is intended to encourage the purchase of new technology vehicles that have the capacity to significantly reduce harmful emissions. The scheme is to operate for a two year period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2002.</P>
      <P>Section 154 amends the rules governing the classification for VRT purposes of certain vehicles, mainly jeep derived and car derived vans, to ensure greater evenness of treatment of such vans classified under category B of VRT, taxable at 13.3% of the open market selling price. The rules for classification will be much clearer and less easy to manipulate. Sections 155 to 164 deal with definitional and other procedural matters in relation to excise duties and licences.</P>
      <P>Sections 165 to 179 and 174 to 177 are largely technical changes. However, the transfer of business provisions included in these sections allow for the VAT free transfer of milk quotas between farmers. Sections 171 and 173 confirm the budget VAT changes. These are the reduction in the rate of VAT from 21% to 20% and an increase in the farmer's flat rate VAT from 4.2% to 4.3%. Section 172 makes a technical change to the VAT rules on foot of the recognition of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development as a taxable person for the purposes of the cattle testing or purchase for destruction scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> Sections 178 to 180 are part of a package of measures to improve the tax collection system, especially VAT direct debit. The new provisions will develop and enhance arrangements governing payment of VAT through direct debit, including the imposition of interest in certain cases of underpayment. Section 181 imposes a penalty for the use of a registration number after it has been cancelled.</P>
    <P>Section 183 contains three significant provisions. First, it clarifies that the supply of research activities is not an exempt educational activity. Arising from an approach from the European Commission, the Bill applies VAT at the standard rate to research provided for a fee by educational institutions. This will help to ensure a level playing field in tendering for research services. This amendment will also enable third level bodies to reclaim VAT on taxable services provided under EU and other research programmes.</P>
    <P>Second, this section gives effect to the European Court of Justice ruling that existing tolled facilities, tolled roads and bridges, operated by the private sector are subject to VAT. Such tolls will be subject to the standard rate of VAT from 1 July 2001. Third, the services supplied by insurance companies and related services by insurance agents are outside the scope of VAT. The section also provides for this exemption to apply to loss adjusters and to claims handling services, when they are acting as an insurance agent on behalf of an insurance company.</P>
    <P>The VAT directive on fiscal representatives will come into force on 1 January 2002 and is being transposed into Irish law by section 182. The directive abolishes the right of a member state to impose a requirement for a VAT fiscal representative on a non-established person. This will require revocation of section 37 of the VAT Act, 1972, from that date.</P>
    <P>Sections 186 and 195 provide for an increase in the stamp duty exemption threshold for mortgages from £20,000 to £200,000 to have effect for mortgage instruments executed on or after 26 January 2001. While mortgages represent almost half of all documents stamped each year by Revenue, they account for a very small proportion of the tax revenue yield from all stamped deeds. The increase in the threshold will reduce the administration burden in Revenue and ease the compliance requirements for solicitors.</P>
    <P>The Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, provided for particular reliefs from stamp duty on first-time house purchase on certain conditions, where the second home is acquired following a marriage break-up under a decree of divorce or a judicial separation. Section 191 extends these provisions to circumstances where there is a deed of separation or a decree of nullity of a marriage. I agreed to consider an extension to such cases when the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 2000, was being passed by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> A stamp duty exemption is being provided in section 192 for approved voluntary and co-operative housing bodies for land acquisition coming within the ambit of the Housing Acts. Those voluntary bodies which are not registered charities are at present liable to pay stamp duty at 9 per cent. Section 193 provides for a stamp duty exemption for the National Building Agency for land acquired for social and affordable housing.</P>
    <P>Section 194 abolishes the £1 per policy stamp duty on permanent health insurance policies and critical illness policies. Section 195 also abolishes the 0.1 per cent stamp duty on life assurance policies announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>Under the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, investors who have a contract evidenced in writing before 15 June 2000 can avail of the previous stamp duty rates in existence prior to 15 June where the conveyance or lease is executed before 31 January 2001. This deadline is being extended to 31 July 2001 in section 196.</P>
    <P>Where an individual has obtained relief from capital acquisitions tax on certain farm lands and these lands are subsequently acquired from the individual under compulsory purchase order within six years of the transfer, the CAT relief given will be clawed back unless the lands involved are replaced within a specified time. Section 199 extends the period allowed for such replacement investment.</P>
    <P>At present, works of art which are lent to cultural institutions in the State by non-Irish resident individuals may be liable to CAT should the lender die during the period of the loan, as the asset would be situated in the State at the date of death. Section 200 provides for an exemption for CAT purposes in such cases.</P>
    <P>Irish Government securities are exempt from CAT where the disponer and beneficiary are neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State. If the disponer is domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State, the securities must be held for three years prior to the gift or inheritance in order to obtain the CAT exemption. Section 201 extends this three year time period to six years to reduce the opportunity for tax planning in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 203 provides that, as and from 6 December 2000, foster children will be treated the same way as other children for the purpose of CAT. To qualify for this equality of treatment, a fostered individual must have been cared for and maintained from a young age up to the age of 18 for a successive period of five years. This change responds to representations made to me on this issue by many Deputies.</P>
    <P>Where an amount exceeding £5,000 stands in a joint deposit account in the names of a deceased person and another person, the bank concerned cannot release the account into the name of the survivor without a clearance from the Revenue Commissioners. Section 204 increases this clearance threshold to £25,000. Section 206 abolishes probate tax, which I consider to be an invidious tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> Section 205 extends the CAT exemption which currently applies to IFSC-Shannon certified collective funds to funds established under the Finance Act, 2000, provided both the disponer and the donee or successor are not domiciled or ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 209 amends CAT business relief to allow the relief to apply in the case of businesses which are carried on either within or outside the State. The change acknowledges the increased overseas diversification of Irish businesses since the relief was introduced in 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 215 abolishes the requirement in direct tax law that electronic record-keeping systems be approved on a case by case basis by Revenue. Instead, Revenue will set out standards for such systems and the taxpayer will ensure the system used complies with the published standards. This measure will reduce the burden of compliance on taxpayers and make electronic record-keeping a more accessible option. The section also places obligations on intermediaries in relation to the acquisition by another person of an interest in an offshore fund or foreign life assurance policy.</P>
    <P>As a central part of the e-Government initiative, legislation to permit electronic filing of tax returns was put in place in the Finance Act, 1999. The legislation was enacted before the Revenue on line system was developed. Section 218 provides a number of technical changes to the legislation to ensure that the law corresponds with the practical operation of the Revenue on line system, which is being phased in. The section also extends these provisions to enable documentation other than tax returns to be provided under this system, for example, claims for medical expenses relief.</P>
    <P>Section 219 streamlines the arrangements for Revenue providing certificates of tax outstanding in court proceedings to make prosecutions easier to mount. Section 220 strengthens the PAYE collection provisions to combat certain practices by employers in delaying payment of PAYE.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 2000, included a provision to allow the Revenue Commissioners to offset a claim for a repayment of tax against outstanding liabilities where a taxpayer had failed to comply with his or her statutory obligations regarding the submission of returns and the payment of tax due. Section 222 contains a provision to allow revenue to refuse to repay a claim until any outstanding return has been submitted. The Bill also includes a technical amendment to put beyond doubt that a repayment may be offset against interest on overdue tax.</P>
    <P>Amounts in tax legislation are converted in section 223 and Schedule 5 into convenient amounts in euro. This will generally involve smoothing amounts in favour of the taxpayer. Some few amounts are left in tax legislation expressed in Irish pounds because they apply to periods prior to 2002. If payments arise in relation to earlier periods by references to these amounts the euro liability will be calculated by the standard conversion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> As I announced already I will bring forward proposals on Committee Stage for a new savings incentive. There has been much focus in recent press coverage on my proposal for a savings incentive as a means of taking demand out of the economy. This is an important aspect. However, I have another goal, which is to encourage individuals to provide for the future by a regular pattern of savings. This is consistent with my approach in earlier Finance Bills, of encouraging pension provision by tax reform. I consider it essential that the savings scheme be as broadly focused as possible. It is for this reason I propose a straightforward scheme, involving a tax credit mechanism. The proposed scheme has attracted much interest and positive comments. I made it clear in the budget that I would take an initiative in the savings area and the scheme has been carefully developed. It is consistent with the approach I set out in the budget of countering inflation through a series of measures including the promotion of savings.</P>
    <P>The discussion of our budget in an EU context has highlighted for us all the role of national budgetary policy in developing a strong and flourishing economy. It is important that we retain the say in this process. This is the essential issue in the recent exchanges with the Commission on this subject. Keeping control of fiscal policy is a core value of all Ministers for Finance around the ECOFIN table and we should not forget that.</P>
    <P>My budgets and Finance Acts during the past four years, including this Bill, have made and will make significant changes to the structure of our tax system, not just in lower rates of income and corporation tax but to the structure of the tax system. I acknowledge the role of the Revenue Commissioners in implementing these wide ranging changes and I appreciate their work.</P>
    <P>I hope the House has benefited from the detailed outline I gave of the provisions in the Bill. This is a substantial Bill both in terms of content and size. I look forward to the debate on its passage and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>In a period of continuous strong economic growth and large surpluses the real test of the wisdom of a Minister for Finance is not how much he gives out to how many but how he adopts policies with long-term benefits rather than long-term traps. A further test is the extent to which he addresses urgent and deep disadvantage. There is no doubt that Deputy McCreevy is a courageous, even innovative Minister for Finance, but is he a wise one? These are the questions I will raise during the course of my Second Stage contribution on the Finance Bill, 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With your permission, A Cheann Comhairle, I wish to share time with my assistant, Deputy McGrath. Being wise is not always popular. It is undoubtedly true that the budget to which this Finance Bill will give statutory expression was a popular one but so too was the Fianna Fáil mani<Col N="627" /> festo of 1977. That ran into major problems within two years and created problems which lasted for 20 years. I agree with the Minister on his determination to share wealth with the creators of that wealth, the people. This is achieved by tax reductions and improved public services. However, I disagree fundamentally with the Minister in the way he has chosen to give these tax cuts and in his Government's ineffectiveness in delivering improved public services. Indeed, the Taoiseach spoke today in the House about how much more money has been provided to the health service, which is true. However, the output and services provided are not as good as they used to be because the extra money is being managed ineffectively. We heard today also about Newtown House, County Wicklow. The Taoiseach spoke about the extra money being provided to these areas, which is also true. The Government seems to think that throwing money at issues is the way to solve problems. More is required. It is undoubtedly true that many areas require extra public expenditure but this should not be provided if the money is managed ineffectively and the desired results are not achieved. I will return to that issue later.</P>
    <P>The Minister's policy of providing income tax reductions is correct but it is going about it in the wrong way for the following reasons. He has consistently given more to the rich than to the poor. He has added to inflationary pressures, thus eroding competitiveness while, at the same time, hiking up expectations. He has taken on commitments for future years when the economy may not be as buoyant as it is now. The Finance Bill is to be amended on Committee Stage to introduce a new five year savings scheme. The fact that it is not already included in the Finance Bill indicates that the proposal is a late and rushed reaction to EU criticism of the Government's budgetary strategy.</P>
    <P>The savings scheme, as presented, is ill-considered for the following reasons. First, its costs are unquantifiable; second, it takes on budgetary commitments for six years hence when the economy may be less buoyant that it is now, third, its contribution to an increase in savings is unquantifiable and questionable; fourth, the major response is likely to be a switch of existing savings, thus adding to Exchequer costs without any economic benefit and, fifth, it is like the morning after pill in that the Minister is seeking to remedy his earlier excesses in the budget. The budget encourages spending while the savings scheme is an ill-defined attempt to discourage it. In effect, the Minister for the stud County of Kildare is riding two horses at the same time. It is exciting now but before long it will end in tears.</P>
    <P>A test of the Minister's wisdom would be to project his existing spending and tax commitments to the end of the saving scheme period, six years hence, and then apply varying growth assumptions for the six year period. It is easy to see that if growth slips to European norms and <Col N="628" /> below, we could quickly end up in difficulty. There is a better way to share our wealth and provide better for the future.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's tax and savings strategy is better and different from the Government's. The following is a summary of our proposals. At least 75% of future income tax concessions should be given each year by issuing shares in a newly created national investment fund to the value of the tax break proposed. The national investment fund should be run by the NTMA along the lines set out in legislation. The shares would not be cashable for five years but, after five years, all dividends and added value would be tax free. This would be a year on year decision, based on the surplus of the preceding year, and no ongoing commitments are involved. This protects the Exchequer for future years. Further incentives to save would include the abolition of deposit interest retention tax. Interest rates are less than the rate of inflation and DIRT represents a tax on negative income. Its abolition would cost £132 million gross a year. We also believe that income tax bands and allowances should be index linked, otherwise there would be creeping increases in taxation. Despite the reductions in tax rates, the transfer to tax credits and the abolition of many allowances, the reality is that people are paying more income tax, not less. I will quote the figures later.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael would also introduce a middle 30% tax rate. Our objective is to increase the number of people on the standard rate of tax. As this would be progressively implemented, a middle rate of 30% would be introduced to remove the current step from 20% to 42%, which is more than a doubling of the rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 35% last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer later to the anomalous situation whereby capital gains tax is 20%, share options tax is proposed to be at 20%, unearned income is taxed at 25% but people on very ordinary incomes are paying at the rate of 42%. This will have inevitable consequences. We believe also there should be a move to reduce VAT to 15%. The move in this budget to 1% is very welcome. However, e-commerce will be the way of the future and Brussels has already proposed that the VAT rate charged in e-commerce should be on the VAT of the producer country rather than on the country of last sale. Whatever country has the lowest standard tax rate will have an enormous competitive advantage. Luxembourg is currently at the minimum permissible level of 15%, which is where we should be heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to abolish the employer's PRSI ceiling threatens competitiveness and employment, particularly high earning employment. We will reintroduce a ceiling. We will increase the present 1% set aside for future pension needs to 1.5%, thus making provision for other future contingencies in addition to pensions. Part of our <Col N="629" /> philosophy is now that we have enormous surpluses, we should set aside more to provide for the future so that when the inevitable downturn comes, we will have made contingency provisions. This would also reduce the current surpluses which are contributing to unreal expectations. This Fine Gael package will increase or maintain competitiveness, achieve a quantifiable increase in private savings at a quantifiable cost, increase public savings as a safeguard for the future and not have a savings policy at cross purposes with income tax policy.</P>
    <P>There are many worthy and supportive proposals in the Labour Party's economic policy document. However, one proposal which is wrong and even dangerous is the suggestion that the 1% of GNP which is now being set aside annually to meet future pension needs should be reduced to 0.75%. It is dangerous because in less than 20 years there will be an additional 300,000 people entitled to old age pension in the Republic. Taking the present pension of approximately £100 per week, which is equal to more than £5,000 per annum, the additional cost of pensions alone in the not too distant future will be £1.5 billion per annum. The supplementary costs that invariably accompany old age could increase the cost by hundreds of millions of pounds. Therefore, I believe that, far from being too large, the 1% being set aside is too little. Nothing is set aside to meet other future contingencies. While so called budget surpluses are so large as to be increasing expectations and demands and this, in turn, will affect our future economic buoyancy. There is a strong case for reducing budget surpluses by means of increases in public and private savings. Fine Gael's policy is to provide not just for the rainy day, but for the nation and the individual.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the emerging labour market problems which are a serious potential threat to our prosperity. There are labour shortages at every level and in every region. These, with budget surpluses, are leading to major pay demands and other inflationary pressures. One of the fundamental pillars of our prosperity &ndash; social consensus &ndash; is threatened. In more difficult times it has been supported by the trade unions and consensus among political parties. I was Opposition spokesman on labour affairs from 1977 to 1981. Even then the trade union movement was far more prescient, patriotic and far seeing than many other interest groups, including employers. The trade union movement has played an enormous role in bringing about our prosperity and it is right that that should be recorded in this House and repeated frequently. I greatly value the contribution the movement has made and continues to make. The labour market requires a much higher priority from the Government and Opposition. The day may not be far off when the restoration of the Department of Labour may be justified in order that a Cabinet Minister can give his or her undivided attention to this serious threat.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> It is a shared policy in the House to reduce the rate of corporation tax to 12.5%. It is a major contributory factor to our prosperity. The rate of capital gains tax has been reduced to 20% and the Minister's decision was more than justified by the greatly increased return. I welcome the proposal in the Bill to tax share option gains at a rate of 20%. Unearned income, such as rental income, is taxed at a rate of 25%. Given these figures, how can it be justified that 509,000 people will pay income tax at a rate of 42%? Social justice issues arise from reducing the top rate of income tax, but they will also arise if it is not reduced. This matter needs careful consideration in the next year or two.</P>
    <P>The recent criticisms by the European Union of the Government's budgetary policy are only half right. In part, they are prompted by irritation on the part of our partners that Ireland has drawn and continues to draw down large sums from the EU budget. These draw-downs are diminishing and our capital investment will in future depend largely on our resources. The scale of what must still be achieved is massive. Although we have reached and exceeded average EU levels of <i>per capita</i> income, this is only a recent phenomenon. Most of our EU partners have had our present levels of wealth for over a quarter of a century. It will take another 25 years of budget surpluses to be invested in economic, social, sporting and cultural infrastructure before we reach the stage of development achieved in most EU member states. We will need to generate significantly higher levels of GNP growth for the next 20 years, at least, compared to our richer EU partners if we are to catch up in terms of economic and social infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>The scale of investment needed gives rise to its own problems. There is a danger of providing so much money for capital purposes that the result will be increased inflation rather than output. We need, therefore, to spend our capital funds wisely and prudently. Moreover, we need to urgently address how we can provide greatly increased capacity for infrastructural development in order that the level of investment needed can be made and increases in output achieved and on time. This is a major problem and challenge.</P>
    <P>The most important failure of the Government is the creation of a socially just society. I became involved in politics with Fine Gael in the 1960s because of the philosophy of the just society. The gaps in equality today are wider than they were then. I encounter awful problems from the streets of this city in my clinics. A young battered wife lived with a man, a foreigner, for a few years before marrying him whereupon he badly beat her with great regularity. After covering up for a long time she left him and ended up in not one, but two woman's refuges and not one, but approximately six bed and breakfast establishments. She walked the streets from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. with no home to go to. She has secondary cancer. It was hard to tell her about the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> If this woman was an exceptional case, allowance might be made, but she is not. This week I met a mother of two children, a sub-tenant of her brother. Her 16 year old daughter has secondary melanoma and needs regular baths during the day and quiet and privacy, but cannot get it because of living in an overcrowded house. This woman has no prospect of securing housing in this wealthy, prosperous city. These are the realities over which the Government presides. It has failed dismally to achieve or even to attempt to achieve social justice.</P>
    <P>Thousands of young children leave primary school every year with major literacy problems. I am informed that in 90% of cases they are avoidable. All that is needed to reduce the problem are proper resources for schools and home-school liaison. Each one of these children is embarking on a life of permanent disadvantage and poverty.</P>
    <P>The Minister has reduced the top rates of capital taxes because of the problems in those areas, but they are nothing compared to the problems on the ground. I make no apologies for getting angry about the failure to address these problems and the indifference of our economic and media commentators. There is a job to be done, but it will not be done by the Government.</P>
    <P>The lack of a coherent policy for the elderly who require long-term care, especially those who depend on the charity of neighbours and friends, is another chronic failure of the Government. It will not go away; the magnitude of the problem will increase ever year. Yet, there is no plan to ensure those who built our economic prosperity by their sacrifices are able to live out their final years in dignity, comfort and security. Headline figures about tax give-aways and rate reductions ignore these realities. It behoves us all to evaluate our economic policies in a new and deeper way.</P>
    <P>My party is opposed to the Minister's individualisation programme. In introducing this measure he has focused on rewarding women who go out to work. The reality is that the Government is not thinking of women as citizens, it treats them as units of the labour force. Individualisation is a naked attempt to increase female participation in the labour force and to coerce women, who might otherwise opt to work at home while their children are young, into the labour force. That is not to say there should not be recognition of the costs of going to work. There are costs involved in going to work, not only child care costs, although they are very significant. What happens when the woman has to or wants to give up work or where one of the spouses loses his or her job? Not only do they lose their salary but they lose £11,000 of the tax allowance. They suffer a double whammy. That is when the chickens will come home to roost. When there is a downturn in the economy, when people start to lose their jobs or leave work to care for relatives or for whatever other reason, they suffer cruelly not just the loss of one salary, but also the loss of £11,000 of the tax allowance.</P>
    <P>As citizens, many women choose to pursue <Col N="632" /> careers while many others choose to work in the home. The reality is that many women whose preference is to work in the home have been forced to work because of the abject failure of the Government to deal with the accessibility of housing. A starter house is now outside the financial capacity of even a two income family, both on the average industrial wage or, indeed, above it. It is socially unacceptable that women are forced to work merely to meet the monthly cost of today's basic mortgage. Today's reality is that the housing crisis has become so critical that both spouses are forced to work not to meet a mortgage on a home they own, but to meet the cost of rent.</P>
    <P>It is an insult to taxpayers to tell them how much this budget and previous budgets presented by this Minister have benefited them. Are a couple who leave their children in a crèche at 7.30 a.m., travel for over an hour to work, travel a further hour home in the evening and pick up their children at 6.30 p.m. better off? This is the new way of life for many. It is a lifestyle which requires both parents to work and which entails seeing their children for less than an hour each weekday. It is a way of life where home ownership is the aspiration of the few and the financial struggle to meet rental costs is the lot of many.</P>
    <P>What has the Government done to address the quality of our citizens' lives? It can continue to fool itself that reducing the tax take is enough, that the cost of accommodation, the crisis of child care and the hours spent in commuting do not matter, but quality of life matters. The Government does not see this and has done nothing to help improve it.</P>
    <P>In pure monetary terms, taxpayers are better off. In disposable income terms, taking account of housing costs alone, they are worse off under this Government. Furthermore, if they are sick, they must wait longer for treatment. If their elderly parents require care, they must struggle harder to find a way to let them live their lives with dignity. By any measure, the quality of life for many citizens has disimproved significantly, and the Government seems completely oblivious to the reality. Good government requires vision and leadership to plan for a fair future for all, but this budget has no such vision, awareness, equity or leadership.</P>
    <P>Ireland has changed dramatically over the last decade. Our society and way of life have changed even more. Much of this has been driven by economic prosperity. We can be proud of these achievements but to pretend that all is well would be a grave mistake. Some 20 years ago we judged the budget by how much our income had increased. Ten years ago our assessment was based on how much our income tax was reduced. Today, we are still using the same yardstick to decide whether a budget is good or bad. It is convenient to do so. A standard rate of income tax of 20% sounds good. What does not sound as good is that under this Government, the percentage of taxpayers paying tax at the standard rate <Col N="633" /> has increased by a mere quarter of one per cent, from 38.75% in 1997-98 to 39% in 2001-02. It is convenient to use old guidelines because they ignore new realities.</P>
    <P>This year's budget provides a gain of about £15 per week for a single person on the average industrial wage. The new reality is that because of the Government's failure to deal with the housing crisis, that £15 will be absorbed by rent increases. While the Minister can trumpet a reduction in tax of £15 per week, the reality is that disposable income is not increased when the cost of accommodation is taken into account. The reality is that for many citizens, the benefits of this budget in real life terms are illusory.</P>
    <P>I refer briefly to some of the items the Minister mentioned. He announced a reduction in stamp duty for investors in new homes. In so far as that goes, I welcome it because there is a major and growing problem in the rental sector. However, it must be clear to the Minister that the first, second and third Bacon reports, individually or collectively, have not resulted in an improvement in the position. It is still the case that two young people on good incomes trying to buy a starter home find it extremely difficult to do so. In this city alone, hundreds of acres of land, which has been identified by Dublin Corporation, is in the ownership of the State, and that includes health board land, Department of Defence land and CIE land. Nothing has been done to marshal Government land for housing purposes. There is land in my constituency which was to have been sold by CIE each year for the past six years. Department of Defence land at Clancy Barracks was to have been sold each year for the past six years but it is still there. There are many other such examples.</P>
    <P>When one has lots of money it is very easy to give away lots of money, but it must be clear that the Government is getting poor results and little value for that money, whether in education, health, social services, housing or traffic. There is a better way. I hope that when the election comes, whether in three months or six months, there will be a clear alternative for the people &ndash; the current Government or, alternatively, a Government committed to social justice and to the effective running of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, for sharing time with me. Budget time is a time when successive Ministers for Finance talk about the global picture and about how good they have been at delivering tax cuts and so on. So many people have been taken out of the tax net in recent years, I am surprised anybody is paying tax. Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, went down that road again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On budget day he said that tax reform is a matter of fairness and that in his first three budgets, he made radical reforms to the whole tax system. He went on to state that he had removed substantial numbers from the top tax rate and that for the first time in many years had ensured that single earners on the average industrial wage and others <Col N="634" /> on modest incomes would no longer have to pay the top rate of income tax. The Minister stated that he had also radically improved the position of the lower paid in the tax system and that to listen to some commentators, one would believe that all the gains from tax reform had accrued to those they like to call &ldquo;high earners&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to state that in the past three years, he had removed 176,000 low earners from the tax net, cut the burden on the lower paid in half, reduced the tax rate on the low paid in many cases up to ten percentage points or more and had done far more than many other advantaged economies in cutting taxes for single and married earners and those on low and middle earnings. That is what the Minister said on budget day but, regretfully, it is not a view shared by everybody, particularly if one looks at what some of the commentators have said.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of the responses to parliamentary questions. In Parliamentary Question No. 215 of 9 December 1997, I sought information on the annual percentage of taxpayers who had paid income tax at the higher rate for each of the ten preceding years. In 1994, the percentage was 38.4%. It was 37% in 1997 but this figure increased by 1.2% to 38.2% post-budget in 1998.</P>

      <P>In Parliamentary Question No. 178 of 15 November 2000, I sought further information. It looked bad to have 38% and 39% at the top rate so the Department changed its methods of calculating the figures. I tabled a parliamentary question to elicit the reasons for the discrepancy between the figures issued two years ago and those issued in 2000. I was informed that the method of calculation had changed but even the new figures, irrespective of how they were manipulated, showed that 29.27% were at the top rate in 1997, 29.9% in 1998 and 31% in 1999. In real terms, the figures increased from 379,000 in 1997 to 453,000 in 1999, after which there was somewhat of a decrease. Why is the Minister trotting out figures which he knows are not accurate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report entitled &ldquo;Ireland &ndash; Changing Incomes, Unchanged Taxation&rdquo; written by Mr. Eunan King, a senior economist with NCB stockbrokers, revealed the results of a survey on taxation in Ireland in the 1990s. Mr. King's conclusions, reproduced more concisely in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, stated that income taxes remained at about 21% of income on average throughout the 1990s, in spite of various reforms. Stating that a decrease in tax rates is necessary to <Col N="635" /> keep the tax burden from increasing, Mr. King argues that this would not adversely affect inflation. It is clear from his research, he states, that income tax reform has not stimulated the economy because the average tax burden has remained unchanged throughout the past decade. The figures Mr. King outlines are quite startling. He found that the average tax rate for the top 10% of taxpayers increased by 0.4 percentage points from 29.6% to 30% over the ten year period. For the next 30% of taxpayers, the average tax rate fell from 21.8% to 20.5%. The average rate for the remaining 60% &ndash; the low earners for whom the Minister claims to have done so much &ndash; fell from 11.2% to 10.2%. Mr. King also states that although a person earning £15,000 per annum would have seen a reduction in his tax bill, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of income, few people were on unchanged incomes for long periods. As incomes increase, allowances in the standard rate band shrink as a proportion of pay and the rise in income may mean movement to a higher marginal tax rate or that a larger proportion of income is taxed at the higher rate unless allowances and bands are adjusted in line with the rise in pay. He also points to the difficulties encountered by people returning to Ireland.</P>

      <P>If one were to ask people if they are paying less tax than they did previously, they would probably say they are. A couple who had £5,000 in interest relief five or six years ago were able to claim that against their tax, probably at the top rate if they were paying the top rate of tax, and that was worth in the region of £2,500. The same £5,000 is now allowable at 20% and is, therefore, only worth £1,000. The same applies to VHI and other allowances.</P>

      <P>Personal allowances are also only allowable at the 20% rate which means that they are worth significantly less. A couple with £7,000 income tax relief some years ago took that off their income and paid tax on the balance. The allowance now stands at £11,400 but, as a tax credit, it is worth a good deal less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> The Minister provided a rent allowance increase in the budget to people in the private rented sector. The figure increased from £750 to £1,000, an increase of £1 per week at 20%. However, if one does one's sums properly, it is actually only an increase of 35p or 70p per week. The Minister further stated in his budget speech that this measure would cost £7 million in a full year. I have consulted the Department and gone over my own figures and that figure is wrong; £3.5 million is a more realistic figure. The figure was exaggerated to twice its actual cost. I wonder why that figure was allowed through and why, when I pointed it out to the Department, it was not changed. If that figure is wrong, how many other figures might be wrong? Such inaccuracy is unacceptable and should be stamped out very quickly.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to two items which may be more appropriate to the Social Welfare Bill. I do not agree with lifting the cap on employers' PRSI as I believe it will adversely affect our competitiveness in Europe. On individual PRSI ceilings and the question of the &ldquo;PRSI holiday&rdquo;, all of the allowances stand at 74% this year, yet the PRSI ceiling remains at 100%. Many of the people who should qualify for a PRSI holiday during the tax year from April to December this year will not get it. This suits the Department which will collect approximately £130 million in additional revenue. That is unfair. If allowances stand at 74%, the ceiling should too. The people affected will have to pay an additional £300.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to moneys gained from compulsory purchase orders. The Minister will be aware that compulsory purchase orders are applied to certain sections of land when new roads are being built and farmers receive a relatively low rate for their land. If a new road is built there are compulsory purchase orders under which farmers get a low rate for their land. They must pay tax or reinvest it. With the advent of toll roads there could be, as in my area, 300 hundred farmers affected. The land is sold to developers who build the road to make a profit. Is it fair to use this 1919 measure to give land to people who exploit it through tolls? This is unfair and the legislation must be updated to account for this.</P>
    <P>I recommend the removal of excise duty on non-automotive LPG for heating purposes in the poultry sector. I am glad that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is taking the Chair as it particularly affects County Monaghan. In its budget submission 2000, the IFA proposed that duty on this kind of LPG be eliminated or rebated for agricultural use to enable the poultry sector to compete with Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The level of excise duty on the LPG is 1.43p per litre or 6.5p per gallon. Council Directive 92/82EEC allows zero minimum rate of excise duty on LPG, methane and kerosene used for heating purposes from 1 January 1993. For the sector to remain competitive, this measure must be applied. An amendment could be introduced on Committee Stage.</P>

      <Col N="637" /> I and other Members received a letter from the Irish Wheelchair Association. It says: </P>
    <P>I am writing to express the outrage of the members of the Irish Wheelchair Association regarding the negative change in the budget announced in September 2000. The association is particularly concerned about the withdrawal of some people's entitlement to the mobility allowance. The criteria for the mobility allowance are so stringently applied that only 2,600 people were in receipt of this allowance last year. The Irish Wheelchair Association is calling on you to demand that the Minister for Finance rescinds his decision regarding eligibility for the mobility allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that Deputy McDowell will take the subject up after me. In the 1999 budget, the Government said it was allocating £46 million, with £20 million for capital projects, in the 2000-01 tax year. In October 2000, £58,000 had been allocated. The Government then announced two further allocations of about £25 million for capital projects knowing that the money had not been spent That is political deception of the highest order. It knew it would get maximum media attention by making this announcement. The child care system is a disaster from a funding point of view. The Government should stop paying lip service and treat it properly. It is not a question of money. As Deputy Gay Mitchell said earlier, there is plenty of money but it is not taken up. The Government is not managing the services and not delivering at local level in health, education and elsewhere. The service is not getting to the user.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister announced in his speech, in two paragraphs, that he had abandoned the tax proposals in the third Bacon report. I did not consider those proposals a panacea or that they would solve the problems of first time buyers immediately. No one did. I supported them, as did my party, because we believed that they would allow first time buyers a leg up for a time by taking investors out of the market by putting in disincentives. The Minister said something similar.</P>
      <P>Six months later, this evening he announced that he is abandoning the strategy. He had no argument and gave no indication that he has assessed the effect of the policy. He did not say that the policy is not working. He baldly announced that he will reverse one part and abandon the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entitled to ask why. The Minister could not have assessed the impact on the housing mar<Col N="638" /> ket in the last six months. How could he have assessed whether first time buyers have derived a benefit from it? Has such an assessment been done? I doubt it. It has the appearance of this Fianna Fáil Minister bending the knee to a small group of developers and builders in the centre of Dublin. They and the pressure they have been applying are known. We see the results.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the Minister has not the courage to come here and justify his decision. He simply announced that what was a good idea six months ago is no longer the case. This is not good enough. We spent a lot of time last year as inflation slowly spiralled out of control asking for compensatory measures for social welfare recipients. We were told to wait months, until the budget but, suddenly, when a few well-heeled Fianna Fáil supporters seek action then they get it with no prior consultation or warning. The Minister ought to explain.</P>
    <P>Is he satisfied that first time buyers have improved access to the market? It is now as difficult for them as it was six months ago. It is a disgrace that the Government has not even the fig leaf of a policy in this area. The taxation element was not a panacea but we must know why it was shamefully reversed.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Mitchell is not here but I understand why. Fine Gael's social democracy is not for me. Deputy Mitchell announced that they would abolish DIRT, cut five points off VAT, reduce the upper rate of income tax from 44% to 30% &ndash; it was 35% last week &ndash; and reduce capital spending, plus restoring the PRSI ceiling for employers. All these proposals diminish the capacity of the State to deal with the social issues he referred to. I do not doubt the sincerity of Deputy Gay Mitchell, and indeed the Minister, when they say they are concerned about social issues like housing, education and health. I do not understand how he can make a speech which devastates the State's capacity to perform its central role in getting to grips with these problems and making the social investment needed. We cannot pretend that one can have it both ways, as the Government did in its most recent budget. It seems that Fine Gael is determined to go down the same road, and I deplore that.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should move on to the Government. The Labour Party wants to see a sustained period of investment in services, by which I primarily mean health, as well as education, housing and the care of those who are dependent on social welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the secretary general of the Department of Health and Children put it neatly last week, when his unscripted comments were reported in <i>The Irish Times. </i>He said that a low-tax, low-spend economy leads to what he acknowledged as an inadequate health service. That one crisp, devastating sentence summarised <Col N="639" /> where we find ourselves at the start of the 21st century. Although our GNP and GDP <i>per capita</i> will soon rank among the richest in Europe, and indeed the world, our health service, schools and roads are among the worst. Not only that, we have a Government which is determined to do little or nothing about it.</P>
      <P>The secretary general's message is simple and should be obvious: quality and equity in the health service cannot be brought about without spending more money. If we want a system to provide a quality service to the entire population, not just a minority, then we have to pay for it. When Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were last in power, they devastated the health services with the cutbacks of the late 1980s. Much of the intervening time has been spent getting ourselves back to the already unsatisfactory position of 1987. In the meantime, the population has increased by 20%, medical science has moved on, and people's demands have, understandably and rightly, increased.</P>
      <P>The health system is undermanned, under-resourced and has too few beds. It has about the same number of beds as it had ten years ago, despite the fact that the population has increased by 350,000 or 400,000. The service is hopelessly unequal in terms of access, and fails a sizeable percentage of the population. There are, admittedly, problems with administration and rigidities in the staffing structure as there are in much of the public service. The ultimate blame for this undoubtedly lies with the Government, which had the resources to do something about it, but flatly refused to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government had a unique opportunity to invest in the health services and to make reforms which are unquestionably needed. For most of its four years, it refused to do so. The comments of the Minister for Finance's last year were instructive he described the health service as a black hole into which he was pouring money without any obvious results. He had a unique opportunity to invest in the health service, but his body language and his words make clear that he regards it as a waste of money. It is fair to say this year's Estimates suggest a last minute realisation that the Government was, and is, getting it horribly wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt the Fianna Fáil focus groups tell them that people are not quite so self-centred as they thought, and that people want something other than tax cuts. No doubt Fianna Fáil has realised that it will suffer electorally because of its abject failure over the past four years. No doubt the Minister for Health and Children will be trotted out to ooze concern over the next few months, and I may well be given a few shillings or a few euros more. It is a drastic, desperate, last <Col N="640" /> minute attempt to dress up and conceal a policy failure, which arose from a policy choice.</P>
    <P>From the start this Government committed itself to a spending limit which never made any sense and which is now patently ludicrous. The Government limited itself to year-on-year increases in net current spending, as it defined it, of 4%. This limit took no account of inflation or economic growth. It was deliberately pitched as a limit on investment which took no account of our capacity to pay. That was no accident as it was deliberately designed by the Minister in that way. He even went so far as to say that if inflation exceeded 4%, he would introduce real cuts in spending to meet his own target. He went on to say, after the election was won but before he took up power, that this was an absolute priority for him and he would stake his credibility on it.</P>
    <P>It may well be that many Fianna Fáil members, both inside and outside this House, did not know what they had bought into, but the Minister, Deputy McCreevy certainly did, and the Taoiseach who appointed him certainly did. The effect has been dramatic and unambiguous. Needless to say, the target has not been met, as spending has increased by an average of 6% over four budgets. Economic growth has averaged half as much again, with the result that the proportion of our national income which we invest in services has consistently declined over the last few years. Spending in social services has come down from well over 30% when the Minister came to power to 25.9% now. According to the stability programme produced by the Department of Finance in the last few weeks, it will continue to diminish to 22.5% in 2003. This is by far the lowest figure in the EU, if one measures by GDP figures, which I use only because they are used in the stability programme. It is the second lowest figure, after Britain, if one uses GNP figures, which is a fairer way to do it. This level of investment, which was the deliberate choice of the Government, is inconsistent with a decent level of social provision. That is the central message that I and the Labour Party have made for several years.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at the nature of Fianna Fáil. I recently re-read the contribution by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to the budget debate last year. It really is wonderful stuff. The rhetorical parts of the speech's opening would not be contested within my party. He even says he has no ideological problem with identifying himself and his party as left-wing and social democrats. Last week, however, the Minister for Finance, who controls the nation's purse strings, quite happily and comfortably defined himself as a member of a centre-right party. Most people in Fianna Fáil, I suspect, do not really care, which is in the nature of the party.</P>
    <P>The party looks in both directions at the same time, continues to straddle the fence and continues to do whatever its Government partner wants. For a long time, that was perfectly acceptable and still seems to be for a percentage of the <Col N="641" /> population. It was acceptable because Fianna Fáil cloaked itself in the green cloak of nationalism. We all know the green cloak is thinner these days, and that defining one's self on that issue is not as easy as it once was. I suspect that more and more people are judging Fianna Fáil by its actions, and are seeing in whose interest it is working, and has worked over the past few years. I suspect that there might be something of an electoral shock for both the social democrats and the Christian democrats, or any other labels it may choose to use, in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention an article by Deputy Andrews in <i>The Irish Times</i> just ten days ago, when he said he was astonished that the Labour Party seemed to be arguing against increases in spending. I have never argued against meaningful increases in spending, nor has anyone in the Labour Party, to the best of my knowledge. I have always insisted we get value for money. I have gone to some trouble to set out mechanisms and units we would use in order to ensure we could assess the sort of value we are getting. I have not argued against increases in investment spending during the past three or three and a half years I have been spokesperson for my party. How Deputy Andrews could have formed the view that I have, is beyond me. I say that in a sense of desperation, as there is a significant difference between my party and Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. A choice is available to the public. They can discern, with relative ease, that we are saying different things. It is not necessary for Fianna Fáil spin doctors or the press office to come up with false differences. There is no need for them to distort what we are saying. I am happy to stake out my territory. I am sure the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State would be happy to do the same. Therefore, let us have a genuine, open and honest debate. There is no need to get into, what I conclude are, deliberate distortions of the Labour Party's position for party political gain.</P>
    <P>Tax is central to the Finance Bill, which implements the tax changes announced on budget day. Three commitments were given by the Government in the PPF and renewed in the PPF renewal document. One was to reduce the tax rates. That commitment was given at the time of the formation of the Government. The second was to take those on the minimum wage out of the tax net and the third was to complete the individualisation project.</P>
    <P>The argument about the rates is well worn at this stage, but I will restate one element of it. Deputy McGrath gave us an interesting exposé on the higher rate of tax. I am on record many times as saying that should not be a priority, and in the current circumstances we should not touch it. That is not a suggestion on my part or on the part of my party that we should screw the rich or everybody who pays the higher rate of tax, far from it. The 30% or so of income earners who pay the higher rate of tax benefit disproportionately well from all the other taxation <Col N="642" /> measures. They benefit from the reduction of the standard rate and from the increase in the credit. There is no need to put icing on the cake. Why the Minister chose to do so and continues to pursue that policy is beyond me. It can be read only as a deliberate skewing of the benefits of economic growth in the direction of people who need it least, those who are best off in our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister went a little further in relation to the minimum wage than I thought he would be able to in this year's budget by taking some earnings out of the tax net altogether. I commend him for that, as that is the way to go. That is how I would have liked to do it. I sound a note of caution, however, as he achieved it largely by the increase in the PAYE allowance. My concern about this is twofold. First, the Minister of State will be well aware that concern was expressed in the past about the legal difficulty in increasing the PAYE allowance because not everybody would benefit from it. We discussed this on Committee Stages of earlier Finance Bills. The Minister appears to have miraculously overcome those difficulties and I would be interested to know how he has managed to do that.</P>
    <P>Doing it by way of the PAYE allowance is effectively an introduction of individualisation of the personal allowances. It is the poor man's individualisation. I have not supported the whole individualisation process and at best I am lukewarm about the process of doing it through the PAYE allowance. I support the principle of taking the minimum wage out of the income tax net altogether and I hope whoever is in Government at the end of this year will be able to complete the process in that budget.</P>
    <P>The third element of the income tax changes is individualisation. I received a number of e-mails and letters, some from noted commentators, such as Garret Fitzgerald, after the budget, inquiring why I had not condemned the pursuit of the individualisation project. It made me wonder about the effectiveness of language, as the word &ldquo;individualisation&rdquo; was not used in the Minister's budget speech. In my naiveté I thought people will see through this but, with the benefit of hindsight, I see they have not. The Minister appears to have got away with a significant further progression of the individualisation process without a significant number of people even noticing it is happening. The arguments put forward last year still apply this year. My party believes women who choose to take a few years out of the work force, perhaps to spend time looking after their children, should be allowed to do so without that family unit being penalised <i>vis-à-vis</i> the position that prevailed two or three years ago. That the Minister has gone further down the road of penalising those people is fundamentally wrong and should be reversed, if and when resources allow for that.</P>
    <P>I accept the general proposition and have done for some time, that this is a small open economy, and that we import a great deal of our inflation. When it comes to energy prices, there is not a <Col N="643" /> great deal we can do about them, but that is a long way from saying the common sense rules of economics do not apply, as that seems to be what the minister and the Department are saying. They seem to suggest that the expenditure increase and the tax reductions which were substantial by any reasonable standards, will have no substantial impact on inflation. That is great news if one is Minister for Finance, as one can pursue fiscal policy without having to have regard to any increase in domestic demand or retail prices to which it might lead, but I do not believe that. It would be great if it were true and I would love to be Minister for Finance if it were, but I do not believe it is. I cannot believe the Minister who lectured us to the contrary for the past 20 years could possibly believe it is true. The Minister came into the House in 1997 when Deputy Quinn announced his last budget and told us that a tax cutting package, which amounted to about £400 million, would break the bank and that it was so inflationary he could not contemplate the awful consequences, yet he does something in the budget and appears to suggest it will not have any inflationary consequences. I do not believe that can possibly be so.</P>
    <P>We need to maintain the level of investment in service and sustain it over a period. We have to make a choice. We have to slow down the rate of tax reductions. We cannot continuously and endlessly deplete the capacity of the State to make the investment I am talking about. That means we must prioritise where we wish to make tax reductions and there is some scope for further tax reductions, but not of the sort the Minister made in his most recent budget.</P>
    <P>On the Minister's European experience, having listened to the Minister's interview with Olivia O'Leary last week, I found it interesting when he said he and the Spaniards were the only centre right Finance Ministers in Europe and that the rest had a different approach, that they are all social democrats and nasty lefties, that we should not pay much attention to them and it was not terribly surprising they found what he was doing in some way distasteful. Maybe I could offer some words of advice. I found it strange that he regarded the Austrian Government as being too left wing.</P>
    <P>Much of the criticism the Minister got came unquestionably from the double whammy of increased expenditure and significantly reduced taxes. It also arose because he blithely ignored guidelines to which he and his officials subscribed and because of the rhetoric the Minister consciously used. Much of the criticism came from Ministers who have supported Ireland in the past and who represent countries and governments whose taxpayers have subsidised Ireland's infrastructure in the not too distant past. Much of it came from northern European countries who sustain the European social model through high taxes and who resent the fact that we seem to be using their subsidies and taxes to reduce our <Col N="644" /> taxes. Much of it came from Ministers who at the end of their electoral cycles would like to spend a little more.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter which is of importance to the people of Rathdowney, particularly the children attending the school there, because of the unusual difficulty they face. Rathdowney is a market town in south County Laois. It is some distance from other towns in County Laois and has a considerable agricultural hinterland. During the years the town enjoyed good educational facilities. There is a significant second level comprehensive school and the town enjoys the benefit of good teachers. The people have a good relationship with the good quota of teachers working in the school on behalf of the community. There is also an excellent throughput of pupils from Rathdowney, with students progressing to the college in the town and other second level establishments in County Laois.</P>
      <P>There is, however, a severe problem. St. Kieran's boys' national school and the convent girls' national school amalgamated in September 1998. The schools were asked to continue for a short period in their respective separate buildings to facilitate an early amalgamation in terms of the legal and other technical documents that were necessary. In September 1999 a written submission was made to the Department of Education and Science by the board of management asking that the matter be addressed with a view to placing the two halves of the school on one campus.</P>
      <P>There is a considerable distance between both halves which are located at opposite ends of the town. This gives rise to problems. Some children have older and younger brothers and sisters in a different school in a different part of the town. This presents a problem for parents in terms of the school run. There is no car parking at the convent school which is located on a busy and dangerous street and little access. There are no proper or adequate sports or cultural facilities at the school because one common room is located in one school while the dressing rooms are in another building at the other end of the town.</P>

    <P>It was the understanding of the board of management, teachers and parents that shortly after the amalgamation took place arrangements would be made to locate the primary school on one campus. In January 2000, 15 months after the amalgamation, a departmental inspector visited <Col N="645" /> the school and made arrangements with the teachers regarding what was likely to happen. The inspector did not report, however, to the Department until three months later in April 2000. Another departmental official arrived at the school in January 2001. Sadly, there have been no developments on this important issue.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will make a positive statement in response to this matter in order that the people of Rathdowney, the board of management of the school, the teachers and the pupils will know what is happening. It appears that the amalgamation which was hastily undertaken in 1998 was no more than the purchase of a pig in a poke. I want this matter sorted out. There has been a sufficient time lapse in which departmental officials and the inspectorate could have made up their minds about the campus on which the primary school in Rathdowney will be located. They could opt for the convent school or what was the boys' school, but a decision must be made. The teachers and board of management are open to discussion which will allow the amalgamation to proceed in the manner in which everybody envisaged &ndash; one school on one campus for the children of Rathdowney. I ask the Minister to set this in train at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of Scoil Bhride, Rathdowney, and the position regarding an application from the management authorities for additional accommodation. The school was formed by the amalgamation of the boys' and girls' schools in Rathdowney in September 1998. The school has a staffing level of a principal, seven class teachers and a shared remedial teacher. It had an enrolment of 200 pupils in September 2000. The school is operating from the two original school buildings on sites which are a considerable distance apart. The boys' school consists of four classrooms, a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation while the girls' school building has six classrooms, a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation. The school authorities have applied to the Department of Education and Science for additional permanent accommodation at one of the existing schools to facilitate the entire amalgamated school on one campus.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has undertaken an assessment of the long-term enrolment projections for the area and completed a technical examination of the two schools. The technical report on the schools is being examined and the Department will be in contact with the school authorities shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This project is one of a large number being processed by the Department of Education and Science. Regarding the primary sector alone, there <Col N="646" /> are over 300 major projects in architectural planning. Major projects in this context are those of an estimated value of £250,000 or more. In addition, approximately 400 applications in this category being processed have not proceeded to architectural planning. Every effort is being made to progress the matter as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Hugely significant progress has been made by the Government in the past three years in eliminating substandard schools from the education system and improving school accommodation generally.</P>

      <P>The facts are that, since taking office, the Government has invested massively in capital projects for the primary sector. For 2000, £81 million was allocated for primary school capital projects. This has been increased to £93 million for the current school year. This compares to only £19.5 million in 1993 and £34 million in 1997. Under the national development plan, 2000-2006, an unprecedented £413 million has been set aside for school infrastructure. In addition to these measures, the level of grant aid under the capital devolved grant scheme for the primary sector was recently increased. In 2000, £14 million was allocated to this scheme. A similar amount will be allocated for the current school year. This scheme empowers boards of management to address health and safety issues themselves at local level.</P>
      <P>From the outset the Government made education a top priority. Never in our history has so much money been invested in education as the Government has invested in the last three years. While we acknowledge that much remains to be done, we remain committed to education as a top priority and will continue to build on our progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that considerable funds have lain dormant in the courts for more than 15 years. Exactly how much money is laying dormant in the courts? Although the names of parties are published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, not many people, including solicitors, read it. What efforts have been made by the Minister's Department to contact the people concerned as many of them were infant plaintiffs and may not have understood what was happening when the lodgments were made? In addition, they may not have been acquainted with the matter since then. It is not right that the State should take the funds which have lain dormant in the courts for the past 15 years into the Central Fund. I ask the Minister of State to assure the House that every effort will be made to trace the beneficiaries of those dormant funds before they are absorbed into the cen<Col N="647" /> tral fund because the State has no right to these funds. If the people were granted those funds in their infant years, they would not have been aware that the funds were available for them. Therefore, I want an assurance from the Minister of State that, before those dormant funds are absorbed into State fund, every effort will be made by the Government to ensure the people, to whom those funds were allocated, or their relatives or next of kin are traced and that they are given those assets before it is too late.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to respond to the Deputy's query and, in so doing, to clarify the scope of my Department's proposals for dealing with dormant funds in the financial sector.</P>
      <P>When developing proposals for bringing forward a scheme for dealing with dormant funds in bank accounts and in matured but unclaimed life assurance policies, the Minister for Finance consulted with Cabinet colleagues who might have been affected by such a policy initiative. In that context, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated to the Minister for Finance that he would not wish dormant funds in the Courts Service to be included in the scope of the provisions for the proposed dormant accounts Bill, as he intended to bring forward proposals of his own to deal with such funds. In the circumstances, it was decided not to address the issue of dormant courts funds in the dormant accounts Bill, which the Minister for Finance will introduce.</P>
      <P>However, I am informed that the Courts Service division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is actively considering this issue in some detail. When the level of funds involved has been established, which was one of the questions the Deputy raised, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will consider policy options for dealing with such funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment of the Dáil the Irish Social Services Inspectorate report on Newtown House high support unit, which was published yesterday. This is a sad, disturbing and frightening report and it is a commentary on our care levels in 2001, which in many ways beggars belief. Who would have believed, after all the reports, <Col N="648" /> recommendations and exposure of past abuses that we would still have the appalling category of incidents and commentary on the levels of support which were provided to children at risk in Newtown House? I ask the Minister of State to publish an action plan as a matter of urgency to address the disturbing and serious issues raised about the care of children in the Newtown House report.</P>
      <P>The report raises the most serious questions regarding the state of residential child care in Ireland and, in particular, facilities and services for young people at risk. We have had the Kelly Fitzgerald report and the Madonna House report, which we discussed in this House in 1996, and it is almost as if we have learnt nothing. The inspection of this case commenced on 17 August 2000 and, therefore, we are not talking about the distant past. We are talking about the services available to children in the Celtic tiger economy.</P>
      <P>Last week, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly said that the services for children in this country were a farce given that 13 and 14 year old boys were being placed in hotels instead of highly secure units and given the specialist care which they need. Today's report is an indictment of current services. Newtown House is a unit specially set up to deal with referrals from the High Court to provide secure, special accommodation for young people at risk.</P>
      <P>The report's findings included the following: young people were at risk due to injuries caused by the excessive use of physical restraint; young people were spending excessive time locked in their rooms; the atmosphere was one of continual crisis; the unit was in unsuitable buildings; there were unacceptable levels of staff turnover; there were very few permanent staff and they were mostly relief staff; and there was an absence of professional supervision for those staff and a lack of support for staff. The staff were very isolated and were placed in a difficult position. We all know how difficult is child care, particularly residential child care.</P>
      <P>There was suppression of correspondence from children to a High Court and others. What action has the Minister taken to ensure that this will not happen again? Indeed, the judge saw only today the letter which was written by Kim O'Donovan. The tragic death of one of the former residents of Newtown House, Kim O'Donovan, has illustrated the potentially tragic consequences when care goes wrong. Is this the best Ireland can provide for its most at risk children? The report illustrates the critical role of an independent inspectorate and I congratulate it on its work. I hope it continues and that it will be supported in its work. The report clearly points out the need for an independent inspectorate in many other areas of Irish life and residential care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> The current situation is an outrage and totally unacceptable in a modern society. Announcing a national children's strategy rings very hollow indeed when the real day-to-day situation is revealed so starkly in this report. Announcements have been made about the provision of a great deal of money, but when this unit was examined it was clear that the money did not find its way to provide the necessary facilities, and I must ask why.</P>
    <P>The Minister must immediately put in place a package of measures which will guarantee secure places for all disturbed children in appropriate settings. If there are barriers to providing secure places such as finding suitable, qualified staff, the Minister must take whatever action is necessary to remedy this problem. It has been dealt with in other countries and it can be fast-tracked and dealt with in an urgent way here. Nowhere is the need for a co-ordinated approach more urgently required than in relation to children. We know many of the reasons so many children are so vulnerable and we are also aware of many of the consequences. It is a political imperative that we take decisive action and not wait and lurch from crisis to crisis.</P>
    <P>The public deserve to know what action the Minister is taking on foot of this report. What monitoring is in place? Are there other residential care centres that need to be inspected? What supports are in place for residential and child care workers? Why were staff paid less in Newtown House than in other similar homes? Will the Minister of State tell the Dáil when the results of the investigations into the excessive use of physical restraint will be made available? Will they be published? Will they be available to the inspectorate?</P>
    <P>The Government can respond to crises in agriculture and in regard to refugees and asylum seekers. Surely we owe it to our children to respond appropriately and put the resources in place rather than wait for another report such as the one published yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the opportunity to raise this issue. The Newtown House report, conducted by the Irish Social Services Inspectorate, has produced serious and disturbing conclusions, but it is not a surprise. It has been clear for some time that the State is failing to provide for disturbed children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last October, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly threatened to hold three Ministers in contempt of court if they failed to find suitable accommodation for a disturbed teenager. In spite of the litany of cases which had gone before the courts involving disturbed children, this was the first time that the State's failure to provide for these vulnerable children really came to such public prominence. The severe sanction threatened by Mr. Justice <Col N="650" /> Peter Kelly highlighted the lethargy, confusion and inaction which has been the hallmark of policy towards children at risk. The judge was forced to issue this threat because in the past he met a brick wall of obfuscation and prevarication. Worse still, commitments made by Ministers before his court have been reneged upon.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's report is another damning indictment of the State's failure to provide for vulnerable and disturbed children. I hope that it will be the last reminder to Government that the State has a mountain to climb in terms of providing for these children.</P>
    <P>One of the most important findings of the Newtown House report relates to the high number of staff members who lacked the skills and training to carry out the work required of them. Given their lack of training, it is not entirely shocking that children were locked up inappropriately, and in one instance a child's leg was broken while being physically restrained. This finding highlights a much wider issue about the type of people employed in this demanding profession. I do not cast any aspersions on those who work in the profession. Secure units require the most skilled staff possible in the child care profession. In the case of Newtown House, it is clear that staff did not receive the required training and support and the type of staff needed were not recruited.</P>
    <P>My fear is that other secure units may still employ staff who are unable to do their jobs properly because they have not received the required training, support or numbers. It is imperative that the lessons of this report do not remain a matter for the East Coast Area Health Board. It is critical that each health board makes an immediate assessment of staff, their training needs, suitability for the work in which they are involved and the support they receive.</P>
    <P>While staff shortages present a problem throughout the service, it is vital that it is made attractive and rewarding for people to train and work in the area of child welfare. The pay, conditions and promotional prospects of those opting to work in this profession must be attractive enough to draw the best into the profession and retain them. There is a high turnover of staff in this area. As it is extremely stressful work, it is essential that those involved are provided with the training and support they require in order that they can provide light and a degree of hope for troubled children.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to attempt to ringfence the problems exposed at Newtown House and kick the report to touch by leaving the matter to the chief executive officer of the East Coast Area Health Board. While specific questions are raised in the report to which the local health board must respond, there is a wider picture of official neglect and underfunding of child residential services in general. All Governments bear a degree of <Col N="651" /> responsibility for this appalling situation. In the light of this report there is a political and moral duty to respond and ensure the heartbreaking individual cases of which we are all aware and the historic underfunding at the root of the problem are not repeated.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that Newtown House was formally known as Trudder House and that that facility was closed down due to the appalling crime of sexual abuse. As we do not want history to repeat itself, we must learn the lessons to be learned. The Newtown House report must be a wake-up call for society and the Government in particular. We must have the honesty to recognise the failings of the past and the courage to introduce real reform. Children at risk and children in need of special care are often the most voiceless and the most vulnerable in society. The letter from a former resident which was supposed to reach the High Court, but never did is illustrative. Children at risk have been neglected and ignored by the State, in this case in the recent past. It should never be allowed happen again. The Minister of State must urgently spell out the steps the Government will take to end this scandal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Fitzgerald and O'Sullivan for raising this issue. I share their concern about the report of the social services inspectorate and wish to clarify the background against which it was prepared. I was approached by parents and a former staff member of Newtown House and, because of my concerns as a result of these approaches, I requested the social services inspectorate to conduct an inspection of the centre which was operating as a high support unit. This process was initiated last July and the report of the social services inspectorate was presented to me yesterday and published on the same day. Copies of the report were made available to the families involved in advance of publication.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the findings of the report, especially where good child care practice was not followed. The inspectors identified a number of areas where the unit had failed to meet the required standards for residential care centres. These were, in part, attributed to staffing difficulties, but also to the limitations of the building which was not purpose-built. The centre is now closed and I have asked the chief executive officer of the East Coast Area Health Board, the body which has statutory responsibility, to take urgent action to address the findings of the report. Resources have been made available to the health board for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inspectors considered that the staff in the unit had not always operated as a team. There were differences of view among staff about how best to manage the behaviour of the young people, resulting in a lack of consistency of approach to <Col N="652" /> the provision of care. The inspectors accept that physical restraint may need to be used on occasion to prevent young people from injuring themselves or others or from causing serious damage to property, but they concluded that there were too many cases where physical restraint was used inappropriately.</P>
    <P>The use of restraint did not always comply with the guidelines issued by the board. The board's chosen method is known as therapeutic crisis intervention which, when properly applied, should result in the subject being restrained without injury. The inspectors noted, however, that in some cases children had been injured during the application of restraint, including, in one case, a young person's leg being broken. The report indicates that managers had not sufficiently monitored the use of restraint in the previous four months.</P>
    <P>Inspectors expressed concern about the number of times young people were locked in their rooms. They acknowledge that the separation of a young person from others is sometimes necessary to help return a tense situation to normality, but noted how young people had on some occasions been kept locked in their rooms for lengthy periods with only short breaks.</P>
    <P>These are worrying findings and I have been informed by the board that a number of investigations are under way into matters referred to in the report. I have asked that these investigations be drawn to a conclusion as soon as possible while having regard to the need to ensure due process.</P>
    <P>The report draws attention to the fact that correspondence from a resident had not been forwarded to the High Court. Given that children are placed in such centres under High Court orders, there is a clear constitutional right of access to the High Court, and I regard the failure to forward this correspondence as a serious matter. I immediately asked the chief executive officer of the board to ensure this was forwarded. It has now been done.</P>
    <P>Inspectors were concerned that, given the complexity of many of the young people's needs and the sometimes challenging nature of their behaviour, the staff were unable to access quickly appropriate support services such as child psychiatry and psychology services. I have asked each health board to ensure children in residential care receive priority for psychological and psychiatric services in order that they receive the therapeutic care they need.</P>
    <P>Inspectors concluded that staff needed more support to help them with the difficult task they faced. They also considered that the board's monitoring arrangements for ensuring compliance with residential child care regulations were inadequate and needed to be improved. As a result of the findings of the report, I have asked <Col N="653" /> the chief executive officer of each health board to report to me on the arrangements they have in place to safeguard the rights of children in residential care.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that working in residential care is particularly challenging and that staff must be provided with the relevant training and support. A fundamental review of the training available to child care workers in is already under way with a view to upgrading the qualifications and skills of staff working in the area. Work is ongoing between the Department, employers and IMPACT, while discussions are taking place with colleges to develop courses which are more appropriate for work in residential care. The current economic climate makes the recruitment of staff difficult and health boards need to be conscious of this. In response, some health boards have recruited staff from outside the State.</P>
    <P>Investment in child care services, including early intervention and prevention, has resulted in a number of posts being made available, up to 600 or 700 this year, including family support and community work which is a more attractive option for some workers. As staff in residential care find the work stressful, I have asked all health boards to strengthen their support for managers and staff.</P>
    <P>There were a number of positive findings from the inspection. Inspectors found a number of good examples of partnership in working with social workers and noted that the cases of young people were regularly reviewed. The unit facilitated family visits and sometimes provided transport to help parents visit the unit. Some of the parental visits were, however, subject to supervision by staff, a source of grievance for some parents. As well as safeguarding the rights of children, the rights of parents and families must also be upheld as the aim must be to reintegrate children with their families as soon as possible. The report noted that all of the residents were provided with education on the premises and there was evidence that some of the children had made excellent educational progress.</P>
    <P>This report demonstrates the importance of having an independent inspectorate system for our child care services. It was for this reason the Government established the social services inspectorate in 1999. The inspectorate in the first three years is concentrating on the child care area and in particular on health board residential child care services. To date, about half of the centres have been inspected and I acknowledge the important work the inspectorate has done so far, in a spirit of partnership with the health board management and staff and other providers of services.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance of this work we are moving to strengthen the inspectorate. The key position of chief inspector was recently filled and <Col N="654" /> an additional inspector is to be recruited. This will bring the number of inspectors to five and will enable the SSI to complete the inspections of the health board residential child care facilities to ensure that all centres meet the required standards. It is important to state that resources have been given to each health board to enable it to implement the recommendations of the SSI and the Department closely monitors progress. It is also the intention to place the inspectorate on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The Newtown House report should be seen in the context of very considerable developments in our child care services. Since this Government came to office in 1997 it has invested more than £90 million extra revenue in the development of our child care services including new child and family support services, such as specialised fostering and early intervention projects to allow health boards to provide a range of appropriate interventions which will place specialised residential care in an appropriate context.</P>
    <P>This additional funding has allowed the health boards to increase the number of high support and special care places available from 17 in 1996 to a current total of approximately 70 places which includes one-third of the 24 places in the purpose built special care unit at Ballydowd in Dublin, which is being opened on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>Plans are under way to develop an additional 56 places nationally by the end of the current year. Including special arrangements for individual children which will continue to be provided, this will bring the total number of places available to about 160 at a total capital cost of approximately £30 million.</P>
    <P>Other important legislative changes are pending. The Children Bill, which is currently before a committee of the House, contains a number of significant measures for non-offending children who are in need of special care or protection. These include Part 3 of the Bill, which empowers health boards to apply to the courts for special care orders to detain non-offending children in need of special care or protection and Part 2, which introduces the Family Welfare Conference on a statutory basis for the first time. I hope also to publish the legislation for the ombudsman for children shortly.</P>
    <P>The Government also recognises that research is needed to establish what works in responding to the needs of children. Policies must be underpinned by solid, research based evidence. In this context, a £200,000 annual research fund has been established under the aegis of the National Children's Office as part of the national children's strategy for research into the needs of children in care.</P>
    <P>Children admitted to residential care have already experienced a great deal of adversity and <Col N="655" /> difficulties in their lives. It is important that this very vulnerable group of children receive services of the highest quality. The safety and care of those children must always be our primary concern. What is important now is that we learn from <Col N="656" /> these reports and continue with the important work already under way to further develop our child care services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 314 together.</P>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, child benefit was payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children were born together. In the case of twins, child benefit was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of 4 and 12.</P>
      <P>In fulfilment of our pre-election commitments, I introduced two key additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 1998, designed to improve the overall package of benefits available to parents of multiple births. First, the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal child benefit rate. Second, the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include families with multiple births of three or more children. Both these measures took effect in September 1998 at a full year cost of some £4.8 million. The enhanced child benefit rates payable in the case of twins and other multiple births give an appropriate level of recognition within the child benefit scheme of the special nature of such births and the additional costs associated with them and fully implement the commitment made in this regard. Furthermore, the child benefit package provided in this year's budget will deliver significant gains to all families with children, including those with twins. Child benefit rates will increase by over 50% from June 2001, a full three months earlier than usual. This marks the first step in a three year programme of increases which will see Government investment in the payment rise by an additional £1 billion by 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of providing any further enhancement of the arrangements for twins under the <Col N="658" /> child benefit scheme is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, in the light of the resources available and other competing priorities. The cost of providing for double child benefit payment for twins is estimated at some £10.2 million in a full year, based on the improved rates recently announced in the budget for 2001.</P>

      <P>Relative poverty, or relative income poverty, is a measure which seeks to quantify the number of households or people whose incomes lie under certain specified proportions of average weekly household income. Data produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, from its analysis of the living in Ireland survey is used to estimate the levels of relative income poverty.</P>
      <P>The latest data available are derived from the 1998 living in Ireland survey and was produced by the ESRI in late 2000. It shows that 10.5% of households were estimated to be below the 40% relative income line, 24.6% of households were estimated to be below the 50% line and 33.4% of households were estimated to be below the 60% line. The corresponding figures for persons were 9.1%, 20% and 28.6% respectively.</P>
      <P>The ESRI has argued that reliance on income alone as a measure of poverty has its limitations and may give a misleading impression when looked at in isolation &ndash; most particularly at a time when there is a very rapid growth in average incomes, as is the case currently. The development of the consistent poverty measure, which incorporates both income and the presence of various indicators of deprivation, is the gauge which has been used for the poverty reduction target in the national anti-poverty strategy and provides a broader picture of poverty caused by a continued lack of resources.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the social welfare benchmarking and indexation working group, established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, provide for an examination of the issue of relative income poverty. The group comprises representatives of the social partners and relevant Departments, under the direction of an independent chairperson. It is expected to finalise its work later this year. I envisage that the findings of the group will inform the development of future policy in this area, including the national anti-poverty strategy review.</P>

      <P>Following the successful piloting in four areas of the integrated services process, ISP, during 1999 and 2000 the Government recently decided to extend the approach adopted in the pilots to 25 locations under the title of the RAPID programme, revitalising areas by planning, investment and development.</P>
      <P>The ISP was overseen by a national committee, on which my Department was represented. For the RAPID programme the 25 areas identified as suffering the greatest concentration of deprivation were selected using objective criteria. The factors taken into account included unemployment levels, income, family and social structure, educational disadvantage and high levels of rented local authority housing.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to be represented on the national steering committee as it goes on to oversee the implementation of the RAPID programme. It will also be appropriately engaged at the local level on each of the individual projects. Its involvement will be, in essence, a continuation and deepening of its already very supportive role for measures aimed at reducing social exclusion. Co-operation between State with other agencies is one of the critical success factors for tackling the problems that beset the most deprived areas. The Department's community development programme has been, and will continue to be, an important element in capacity building in the communities under focus. Departmentally funded family resource centres already make a significant contribution in many of these areas. I will ensure that any further focused support that is required under the Department's grant programmes in the RAPID areas will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>My Department has also been piloting a family services programme, FSP, over the past two years in order to identify how it might best support families generally. The central element of the pilot schemes was the collaborative approach achieved with both statutory and non-statutory bodies and local communities in achieving successful outcomes for those involved. One of these pilot schemes was located in an ISP area and the potential for further development of this approach in the context of the RAPID programme is being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's employment support programme, including measures to enable long-term unemployed people access further education, has been very successful in helping many to move off the live register. The supports available under this programme will be particularly beneficial in the RAPID areas. The RAPID programme will sit within a framework provided by the city and county development boards initiative. My <Col N="660" /> Department participates fully in this and is looking forward to contributing, in this context, to the success of the RAPID programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme is administered on my Department's behalf by the community welfare service in the health boards. An inter-departmental working group is reviewing the scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed primarily at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. All aspects of the scheme will be examined. The review also provides an opportunity to re-focus the scheme, and the health boards' community welfare service of which it is part, to become more effective in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>A widespread consultation process has been undertaken as part of the review with users of the SWA service, information providers and other interested parties including the social partners and the health boards who administer the scheme. The submissions received in response to this process are being considered and will inform the deliberations of the inter-departmental working group. I expect that the proposals of the inter-departmental working group will be finalised by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Customers of my Department may opt to have their social welfare payments automatically credited to their personal accounts at banks and other financial institutions. Officials of my Department have had exploratory discussions over recent years with the Irish <Col N="661" /> League of Credit Unions concerning the possible extension of this facility to customers who hold accounts at credit unions.</P>
      <P>The current position in this regard is that my Department and the Irish League of Credit Unions have agreed in principle that the facility to pay social welfare payments into credit union accounts can be introduced as quickly as possible once the necessary facilities and infrastructures have been put in place by the credit union movement. This includes participation by the movement in the national electronic money transmission system and the acquisition of the information technology systems needed to support such a facility. I understand that work on the acquisition and introduction of these services and systems is currently in progress.</P>
      <P>The precise timescale which will be involved in this process is a matter for the credit union movement. I look forward to extending the electronic payments service to my Departments customers who have accounts at credit unions once this process has been completed.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance, introduced in 1993, is designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force, either through employment or self-employment.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been highly successful since its introduction and to date over 75,000 people have participated. There are more than 38,000 current participants in the scheme, approximately half of whom are engaged in a wide range of self employment options. The number of new claimants in 1999 was 12,784 and last year there were some 9,935 new claimants. Numbers participating in the scheme in 2000 were lower than anticipated. This is largely due to the significant drop in the number of long-term unemployed, at whom the scheme is primarily targeted, and the greater opportunities for unemployed people to return to work without the need for the additional support which the scheme provides.</P>

      <P>The project to effect a smooth transition to the euro in my Department is well in hand. The necessary resources are in place and detailed plans have been drawn up covering the changes needed to the computer systems which support the business, the staff training needed and the information needs of our customers. Work is proceeding on schedule and a smooth transition is expected. In accordance with these plans, payments to customers up to and including 31 December 2001 will issue in £ Irish and from 1 January 2002 all payments will issue in euros.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the Government decided some time ago to align the tax and calendar years from 1 January 2002. The Government has also decided that increases in weekly social welfare payments will apply from the beginning of January 2002. The period of time between the announcement of budget increases and the coming into effect of those increases has been sufficiently long in the past to enable the increases to be incorporated in pension order books as from the normal renewal dates of those books. In view of the bringing forward of the increases to 1 January however, the time period will be shortened and there will be some delay in the implementation of the increases. Every effort will be made to ensure that any such delay is kept to a minimum and, of course, payment at existing rates will continue and any delayed increases will be fully paid. The administrative arrangements for payment of the arrears are currently under consideration and all options are being examined to ensure that any delay in people receiving their increase is minimised.</P>
      <P>In the current year the date for the budget increases has been brought forward substantially to April. This means that for the first time, social welfare increases will come into effect at the same time as the changes in the income tax provisions announced in the annual budget.</P>
      <P>These increases in payments will be included in the payments due to beneficiaries on and from the effective date in each case in April next. The position in 2002 will be even more significantly improved with the increases in early January being a full three months earlier than this year. The aim is to ensure that these increases will be paid on the due date. Even if this is not possible, due to the timing of the budget or other circumstances outside my Department's control, to pay the 2002 increases on the due date, those increases will be paid considerably earlier than this year, to the benefit of all recipients of social welfare payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>A broad range of PRSI changes were announced in Budget 2001. These included the abolition of the employer PRSI annual earnings ceiling; a reduction in the main employee rate of PRSI from 4.5% to 4%; a restructuring of PRSI for the self employed involving a reduction in the self-employed rate of PRSI from 5% to 3% accompanied by the abolition of both the annual earnings ceiling and the annual PRSI free allowance.</P>
      <P>The estimated yield to the social insurance fund arising from the abolition of the employer ceiling is £24 million in 2001 and £159 million in a full year. The overall PRSI budgetary package will result in a cost to the fund of an estimated £7 million in 2001 and a yield of around £117 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has already stated in this House that PRSI changes announced in the recent budget are the first steps in the process of the simplification and rationalisation of the overall PRSI and levies system and that this process will be continued in the future. He also made it clear that the abolition of the employer ceiling must be seen in the context of other measures which have provided, and will continue to provide for substantial reductions in business taxation. For example, changes in corporation tax in the recent budget alone will benefit employers by £214 million in a full year. It should also be seen in the context of reductions in the levels of PRSI payable by employers in recent years.</P>
      <P>Social insurance levels are low when compared with our European partners and this will continue to be the case following the recently announced changes. For example, the combined employer and employee contribution payable in Ireland is lower at all income levels above £136 per week than its UK equivalent when compared on a pound for pound basis. Indeed it should be noted that there has been no ceiling on employer contributions in the UK for many years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 322, 331, 332 and 338 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also available to carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas.</P>
      <P>My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme. A review of the free schemes was published in April last year by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin. The review considered the difficulties involved in access to public transport services. In this regard it notes that there are two main groups affected, those who have a disability which prevents them using the service and those for whom a service does not exist, which mainly affects those living in rural areas. This problem, which is unrelated to the free travel scheme, is part of a wider social and infrastructure problem, affecting all those who are disadvantaged and who can neither afford their own transport or avail of access to public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review notes that while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not obliged to provide services where none exist, nor is it in a position to provide vehicles accessible to people with disabilities. These are matters for the transport providers concerned and for my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise who has responsibility for public transport. The review examined a number of <Col N="665" /> alternatives to the existing system, including the use of vouchers. It considered that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be complicated and less feasible than the current system. Voucher schemes, by their nature, can introduce stigma to a scheme. The use of vouchers is not in keeping with a fundamental aspect of the scheme as originally envisaged; that of using existing spare capacity on public transport as it covers the country. It would do little to facilitate the provision of public transport services where none exist nor would it facilitate the provision of accessible public transport.</P>
    <P>However, the review of the free schemes does recommend that a social transport fund be supported and made available to voluntary and community based organisations for the provision of local transport initiatives that would be unlikely to operate without a subsidy. Such a fund would be mainly social in nature and could facilitate the provision of wheelchair accessible vehicles. The review considered it appropriate that such a fund could be managed locally, perhaps by the local authorities, in view of their knowledge of local services and to maintain community autonomy. This proposal needs to be considered further by the relevant Departments. In this regard, an interdepartmental working group on rural transport has been established, chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and including a representative from my Department, to consider how best to address the rural transport deficit.</P>
    <P>The group has been charged with the development of a template that can be used by each county development board in carrying out a comprehensive county-wide audit of rural passenger transport services to establish the extent to which people in rural Ireland have or do not have access to such services and to establish reasonable rural passenger transport needs. In this regard, a consultancy study has recently been initiated that will provide technical assistance in the template development. I understand that the audits will serve two main purposes, that is, form part of the wide ranging audit of services which is being undertaken by each county development board in the context of the preparation of its county strategy for economic, social and cultural development and to assist the Government in developing policy proposals on rural passenger transport.</P>
    <P>With regard to time restrictions on the free travel scheme, these have been a feature of the scheme since its inception. They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times. The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Restrictions apply at the request of the transport companies because the transport system <Col N="666" /> is under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. In this regard, CIE has expressed grave reservations about any relaxation in time restrictions as many of its services are already operating at full capacity even during off-peak hours. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART, suburban rail services, and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country. The review of the free schemes noted that the demands for the easing of time restrictions are, without exception, based on the fact that people have difficulty attending hospitals for appointments that fall within the restricted peak times. The review recommends that the Department of Health and Children and the health boards should examine this problem with a view to introducing more convenient and flexible appointments for free travel pass holders. My Department has brought this recommendation to the attention of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>In regard to travel for people requiring medical treatment, I understand that under the provisions of the Health Acts, a health board may make arrangements for the conveyance of patients to and from hospitals. The free travel companion pass scheme has been available since 1990 to persons who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone. The companion pass enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge. The review considers that the purpose of the companion free travel pass scheme is to ensure that a person's entitlement to free travel is not diminished because a companion cannot afford to accompany them. Allowing companion pass holders to use their pass when not accompanying the principal travel pass holder would be outside the objective of the scheme. The review of the free schemes examines a large number of issues. I will carefully examine all the recommendations made in this report in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

To introduce the extended leave it was necessary for the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce regulations to amend the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995. These regulations, which required a positive motion of approval to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, were introduced immediately after the Christmas recess. They were passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 8 February 2001 and immediately brought into force. As both Acts require the woman to give her employer at least four weeks notice of her intention to take leave, the extended duration of maternity and adoptive leave can only apply to women who can give their employers the required four weeks notice following the commencement of the necessary regulations. Consequently, the new arrangements apply to anyone who goes on maternity or adoptive leave on or after 8 March 2001. The necessary legislation to increase the duration of payment of maternity and adoptive benefit in line with the extended maternity and adoptive leave is provided for in the Social Welfare Bill, which is being debated by the Dáil. This Bill will enable the extended payment duration to apply to women commencing their maternity or adoptive leave on or after 8 March 2001. In the circumstances, there are no plans to make a once-off payment on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 51, 61, 77, 335 and 336 together.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, noted that it is difficult to estimate the number of full-time carers in the country. While care groups have stated this figure to be around 120,000 carers, they have provided no supporting basis for this figure. The high number may be due to their definition of carer, whereby someone visiting or assisting an older person may consider themselves to be a carer.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that the purpose of the carer's allowance is to support carers who are providing full-time care and attention for persons who are medically assessed as having such a serious disability that they require care for at least 12 months. Based on the research carried out in the review, the number of full-time carers is estimated to be 50,000 people, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>At the end of January 2001, there were 16,699 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. These figures show that 33 per cent of full-time carers are in receipt of carer's allowance, which is an increase of 81% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since the Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £108.4 million this year, representing an increase of almost 200%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> In the 2001 budget, in addition to substantial rate increases, I also announced a number of other measures to support carers. In particular, I made provision for a substantial increase from April 2001 in the income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. It is estimated that this will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify for carer's allowance and almost 3,000 existing carers to receive an increased payment.</P>
    <P>The effect of this increase will ensure that a couple with two children, earning a joint income in the region of £15,100, will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £26,000 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and respite care grant.</P>
    <P>The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes. The income disregards I have introduced already exceed the income limits for the minimum wage rate for joint income households and ensure that carers receive a maximum allowance. It is estimated that in the region of £180 million would be required per annum to abolish the means test and pay the basic maximum rate carer's allowance to the estimated 33,000 carers who are not in receipt of a carer's allowance. In view of the many supports required by carers, particularly in the community care and respite care areas, I do not consider that abolition of the means test to be the best way to support carers or the best use of resources but, of course, I will keep the issue under review.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance examined the issue of a &ldquo;cost of care allowance&rdquo; and considered it to be within the remit of the Department of Health and Children. The estimated cost of introducing a weekly universal cost of care allowance of £50 would be in the region of £130 million annually, based on the current estimate of full-time carers of 50,000. The cost of care allowance of £25 per week would be in the region of £65 million annually. The review also addressed the issues of differing care needs and it proposed the introduction of a non-means tested continual care payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It envisaged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency.</P>
    <P>To differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the &ldquo;continual care&rdquo; payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> Establishing a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its Action Programme. This area is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children. In the 2000 budget I announced the introduction of the new carer's benefit scheme to further support carers. This scheme became effective on 26 October 2000 and there are now 87 claims in payment. The carer's benefit scheme provides financial support for 15 months to a person who gives up employment to care full-time. As it is based on a person's PRSI contributions there is no means test. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy T. Kitt, is bringing forward carer's leave legislation to protect the employment rights of the carer during that 15 month period.</P>
    <P>In the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government pledged to put in place a co-ordinated approach addressing the needs of carers. One of the key priorities we set was to develop a partnership model to facilitate the development by the State, in conjunction with the private sector, of an improved system for meeting long-term care costs. To this end, I have initiated a consultancy study on the future financing of long-term care. The study is examining the strategic issues involved and involves an assessment of alternative financing and funding approaches and their feasibility in the Irish context. The study, which also involves the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance, will encompass the financing of personal long-term care needs both in the community and in institutional care and the potential of the private sector or a combined public/private sector approach to develop new initiatives in this area. I look forward to the completion of this study by the middle of the year.</P>
    <P>The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for the Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to combating social exclusion, ending marginalisation and creating a fairer society. Last <Col N="671" /> December's budget represented a further step towards achieving these goals. The most vulnerable in society, that is, the young, the elderly and those dependent on social welfare, will all benefit greatly from the improvements announced. At £850 million, the social welfare budget allocation is the biggest ever and more than double last year's welfare package. This allocation will, to an unprecedented extent, direct the resources of the State to the needs of our disadvantaged citizens and communities.</P>
      <P>In regard to those who are old age pensioners, the Deputy will be aware of the commitment in the Action Programme for the Millennium to increase the old age pension rate to £100 by 2002. We are well on the way to achieving this target and in some cases have exceeded it with very significant increases granted over the last four budgets. The improvements announced in the 2001 budget will see the old age contributory pension increase to £106 per week, the old age non-contributory pension increase to £95.50 per week and the Widow/er's contributory pension for someone over 66 years of age increase to £102 per week. Overall increases since 1997 amount to between £18 and £28 per week, or 36% to 43%.</P>
      <P>As also announced in the budget, I intend to increase the payment for qualified adults, aged 66 or over, to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension. This will be done over a number of budgets. The increase of £15 per week announced is the first step in this process. These increases are in addition to a series of other measures introduced in recent years which are designed to enable more people to qualify for pensions. These include the provision in 1999 of a special half rate pension for self employed contributors who were already over 56 years of age in 1988 when compulsory social insurance was introduced for this group, and the payment of another special half rate pension introduced in 2000 based on pre-53 insurance contributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New arrangements for the assessment of capital for non-contributory pensions were also introduced in 2000. However, I recognise that more can be done in this area and in August 2000 I launched the report on phase 1 of the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions which identified the key issues in relation to qualification conditions. Phase 2 of the review, which has just commenced, is examining specific proposals and costs in relation to pensions for homemakers and also the issues involved in moving from a yearly average to a total contributions approach. I expect to receive the working group's report later this year. Significant improvements have also been made in the area of the free schemes. In the budget the free schemes were extended to all people over 70 years of age regardless of their income or household composition from May this year. Free electricity allowance and free TV licence schemes were extended to qualified carers, with effect <Col N="672" /> from October 2000 and payments under the free fuel scheme have been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks. The Government recognises that pensioners built this country and the measures I have outlined show our commitment to ensuring that pensioners have an adequate income so that they can enjoy a comfortable retirement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The national action plans against poverty and social exclusion, to be submitted by member states to the European Commission by 1 June 2001, are a fundamental component of the open method of co-ordination as established by the Lisbon European Council. Their aim is to translate the Community level objectives, endorsed in December 2000 by the Nice European Council, into each member state, taking into account national circumstances and policy priorities.</P>
      <P>An outline format for the national action plans was agreed by the EU Social Protection Committee on 19 January. A seminar in Ireland with officials from the relevant services of the EU Commission has been arranged for 9 March. The purpose of the seminar is to have an open exchange of information and debate with relevant stakeholders in Ireland and the Commission about the process of co-ordination on social inclusion and the preparation of the national action plans. Representatives of the relevant stakeholders in Ireland have been invited to attend. These include representatives of the relevant Departments, local authorities, the health boards, social partners, the community and voluntary sector and relevant Government agencies, such as the Combat Poverty Agency, the CSO and the ESRI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on from this seminar, the preparation and drafting of the national action plan will intensify. This will involve using the administrative structures and the processes for consultation already in place for the national anti-poverty strategy and for the review of that strategy currently taking place in accordance with the partnership agreement. The Combat Poverty <Col N="673" /> Agency will also have a key role in drafting elements of the plan. Departments have been asked to submit workplans for the period 2001-03 and examples of best practice to the national anti-poverty unit. The recent advertisement in the national newspapers requesting submissions on the NAPS review provide a further opportunity for stakeholders to express their views on national anti-poverty policies. Each of these submissions will be considered as part of the national plan process. With these preparations in place, I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to meet the 1 June deadline for submission of a national action plan on combating social exclusion, which will be fully in line with all the requirements set.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Blind pensioners receive the same rates of payment as other pensioners in similar circumstances. For instance, the blind person's pension for those aged under 66 years is paid at the same rate as the widow or widower's <Col N="674" /> non-contributory pension and other long-term social assistance payments such as disability allowance. This also means that people with disabilities receive the same level of payment, regardless of the nature of their disability.</P>
      <P>The blind person's pension for those aged 66 and over is paid at the same rate as the old age non-contributory pension and other social assistance pensions for those aged 66 and over. Regardless of their age, blind pensioners are entitled to the same range of additional benefits as old age pensioners. These benefits include the free travel pass, free electricity allowance, free telephone rental allowance and fuel allowance. In addition, with effect from April blind pensioners aged under 66 who are living alone will be entitled to the living alone allowance on the same basis as pensioners aged 66 and over.</P>
      <P>Last December's record social welfare budget allocation of £850 million provided for a £10 a week increase for pensioners aged over 66; an £8 a week general increase; weekly increases ranging between £7 and £15 for qualified adults; and the increased weekly rates to be paid four weeks earlier, from the beginning of April 2001. The Government's action programme provides that the old age pension will be increased to a target rate of £100 by 2002. This target has already been achieved in the case of the old age contributory pension, which will be increased to £106 a week from next April. The old age non-contributory pension and the blind person's pension, in the case of pensioners aged 66 and over, will increase to £95.50 a week from April. In addition, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment that substantial progress will be made in the period up to 2003 towards a target of £100 per week for the lowest rates of social welfare. The improvements provided in the recent budget fully comply with these commitments.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the PPF, a working group, which includes representatives of the various social partners, has been established to examine the range of complex issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of adult and child social welfare payments. As part of its deliberations, the working group will examine the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing up-rating or indexation of payments, including their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns. It is envisaged that the working group will complete its deliberations later this year and I look forward to receiving the results in due course.</P>

      <P>The final report of the Commission on the Family, Strengthening Families for Life, was published by the Government in July 1998. It contains a comprehensive analysis of the issues affecting families in Ireland and wide-ranging recommendations across several policy areas. Some 44 recommendations are made by the commission by way of making a start. The Government is committed to adopting a &ldquo;families first&rdquo; approach by putting the family at the centre of all its policies. The family affairs unit established in my Department has a specific function to pursue the findings in the commission's report following its consideration by the Government.</P>
      <P>Government priorities for the development of family policy and services have brought about significant progress in all the key areas highlighted by the Commission on the Family. In my Department, considerable extra resources amounting to over £17 million a year have been provided specifically for the further development of family services. Major improvements include the following. A record £4.81 million has been provided this year for voluntary organisations providing marriage and child counselling services and bereavement counselling and support services. This is more than five times the amount provided in 1997. A nation-wide family mediation service, now available in 11 centres, is in place as promised in the Action Programme for the Millennium. Preparations for the establishment of the service on a statutory basis are under way in my Department. Some 70 centres are in receipt of funding or have approval in principle to join the family and community services resource centre programme for which some £4 million has been allocated this year. The target is 100 centres over the coming years. I have introduced a families research programme to help shape the development of family policy and services in the future. Some 13 research projects to date have been initiated under the programme. A design brief for a national longitudinal study of children in Ireland has been commissioned by my Department jointly with the Department of Health and Children. It is expected that this study will be completed for the consideration of Government by mid-2001.</P>
      <P>Family services projects providing high quality information about the range of supports available to families from State agencies and the community and voluntary sector with a particular emphasis on services available locally are being piloted in three local offices of my Department &ndash; Cork, Waterford and Finglas. The Government has allocated £12 million in the National Development Plan for the progressive expansion of the successful elements of the pilot over the period 2000-06.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government priorities to radically improve provision for pensioners, carers and dependent spouses and children in households on low incomes address areas highlighted by the commission in its report. The £850 million budget <Col N="676" /> package for social welfare increases this year, which is more than double the increase for last year, is an innovative package to improve the position of those who are most vulnerable in society.</P>
    <P>Major improvements in child benefit to take effect from June 2001 at a full year cost of £329 million and a further commitment to bring total additional investment in child benefit to almost £1 billion a year by 2003 are evidence of the Government's determination to improve child income support and support the choices parents are making in providing care for their children. Child benefit was seen by the commission as an important instrument to address these matters for families.</P>
    <P>My colleagues in Government are progressing a number of significant pro-families policy initiatives in their own areas of responsibility. These include the extension of maternity and adoptive leave; the publication of the national children's strategy in November 2000 and the work under way on the establishment of a national children's office and an ombudsman for children; new initiatives under way in relation to early education, investment in primary level schools and measures to improve provision in special education and to tackle educational disadvantage; major investment in child care provision for which a further £40 million has recently been allocated by the Government in addition to the £250 million provided in the national development plan; the promotion of family friendly policies and practices at the level of the enterprise is being progressed under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in which the Government and social partners are committed to support family life, offer choices for families and equal opportunities for both men and women to play an active caring role in families. The Government is committed to continued progress on these important measures to assist families and to support family life.</P>

      <P>The social welfare benchmarking and indexation working group was established in late 2000 under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It is comprised of representatives from the social partners and Departments and is under the direction of an independent chairperson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has met five times since its establish<Col N="677" /> ment and continues to meet on a fortnightly basis. I understand that the group will produce an interim report by the end of April 2001 and that it will conclude its work later this year. The terms of reference of the group are drawn from the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and require it to examine the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments, having regard to their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns; and examine the issue of relative income poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's employment support services consist of three pillars which are designed to assist and encourage long-term unemployed and other long-term welfare recipients to return to work, training or further education.</P>
      <P>The first pillar is the back to work allowance scheme which encourages long-term unemployed people, lone parents and certain persons with disabilities to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment when they take up employment or self-employment. Ex-prisoners or people with former addiction problems may avail of these supports where they satisfy the underlying conditions of the schemes. In the specific case of ex-prisoners, in order to assist ex-prisoners to reintegrate into the community, periods spent in prison can be taken into account in order to facilitate access to the scheme. Last year I introduced an enhanced version of this scheme specifically targetted at persons who had been five years or more on the live register. Persons participating in this can avail of a six week training period either on or off the job and during this period receive a top up of £35 a week in addition to their weekly unemployment payment. When they take up employment they will be paid a bonus of £200 and a further payment also of £200 after they have completed six months work.</P>
      <P>The back to work allowance scheme has been highly successful since its introduction and to date more than 75,000 people, the vast majority of whom were previously long-term unemployed, have taken part in the scheme. Currently there are more than 38,000 participants in the scheme, approximately half of whom are engaged in a wide range of self employment options.</P>
      <P>My Department recently published the findings of an independent evaluation of the back to work allowance scheme which was carried out by Indecon International Economic Consultants. The report recommended, in the light of the current tight labour market situation, that the scheme be refocused on the longer-term unemployed, that the non-financial supports be enhanced and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced. The report will form the basis for future developments of the scheme and will help my Department ensure that it reflects the needs of the labour market and also the needs of the client groups at whom it is targeted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second pillar of my Department's employment support service is the back to education <Col N="679" /> allowance programme. This is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the work force. Courses covered under the scheme range from second level through to third level postgraduate courses of study.</P>
    <P>However, in cases where a person's choice of course falls outside the realm of formal second and third level courses for which the back to education allowance is payable, there are provisions to allow unemployed people and other categories attend approved courses of education, training and development. Participants on these courses may continue to receive their social welfare payments for the duration of the course. In order to ensure the continued relevance of the back to education scheme, my Department intends to commission an independent comprehensive evaluation of the scheme. This will cover all aspects of the current scheme, including the qualifying requirements and will form the basis for any future changes to the scheme.</P>
    <P>The final pillar consists of the Departments locally based jobs facilitators. Their primary role is to assist the long-term unemployed and other long-term welfare dependants back to work, training or further education by providing them on an individual basis with assistance to access the necessary programmes or supports which their circumstances demand.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the range of supports currently available from my Department's employment support programmes, coupled with the wide range of supports and interventions available through other State agencies provides a high level of support to vulnerable groups in their efforts to re-intergrate into the active labour market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I established an interdepartmental working group, chaired by my Department, to review the existing school meals scheme with a view to developing proposals for the future of school meals provision. The working group first met in September 1999 and while it was originally envisaged that it would take approximately one year to complete the review this has not been possible. There are two principal reasons for this. First, the range of stakeholders, views and possible policy responses was not fully anticipated at the outset. It is now clear that a major reform of policy in this and related areas is required. I am determined to introduce a <Col N="680" /> new and innovative response to this issue, a response that will meet the needs of today's school going children in an efficient and effective manner.</P>
      <P>Second, as a result of the consultation exercise which the working group engaged in, a number of existing school and community based projects in this area came to light. The overwhelming area of concern identified by these projects was the lack of State funding for such projects. I decided that an immediate response was required for these groups who are so committed to the valuable work they are undertaking, with the continuing worry of how they will fund their projects into the future. Accordingly, I provided interim funding of £100,000 last September. I was pleased to announce an additional allocation of £200,000 in budget 2001.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the interim arrangements has also enabled my Department to generate interest in this area amongst schools and groups who heretofore were not in a position to introduce food clubs to meet local need due to lack of funding. This is extremely important and will ensure that these schools are well positioned to take full advantage the new arrangements which I am committed to bringing forward later this year.</P>

      <P>My Department recently published the findings of an independent evaluation of the back to work allowance scheme which was carried out by Indecon International Economic Consultants.</P>
      <P>The report follows extensive research, including a survey of people who have participated in the scheme and who were no longer receiving payment. In addition a postal survey was carried out of employers who employed recipients of the allowance and consultations took place with interested organisations such as the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation.</P>
      <P>The report found that the scheme was affected by high levels of deadweight in that many of those entering the scheme would have found work without the financial support the scheme provides. It recommended, in the light of this finding and in the light of the current tight labour market situation, that the scheme be refocused on the longer-term unemployed, that the non-financial supports available under the scheme be enhanced and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been highly successful since its implementation and has provided a route out of unemployment for significant numbers of long-term unemployed persons. I am happy that the scheme has still a significant role to play in assisting people who are on the live register and other groups of welfare recipients such as people with disabilities, the disabled, lone parents and former carers to re-enter the world of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the recommendations in the report concerning an increased level of training, advice, support and mentoring for those participating in the scheme. In this context I will shortly be introducing a code of practice aimed at employers, participants and the Department as recommended in the report. I have also set aside £250,000 to help persons entering self-employment under the scheme with the cost of public liability insurance and last year I provided an <Col N="682" /> extra £250,000 to the first step organisation to help that organisation expand its programme of interest-free loans to self-employed participants in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The report will form the basis for future developments of the scheme and will help my Department ensure that it reflects the needs of the labour market and also the needs of the client groups at whom it is targeted. It is my intention to consult the social partners about the report and its findings and recommendations with a view to agreeing a consensus approach to the future development of the scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department issues some 890,000 payments covering nearly 1.5 million people each week to customers under a wide variety of schemes. Where entitlements have been put into payment, further contact between customers and the Department arises mainly in relation to providing information or dealing with changes in their circumstances. Contact initiated by the Department would be with a view to ensuring the conditions for entitlement to payment continue to be met or where it was considered that the person might have an entitlement under another scheme, to inform and advise them accordingly.</P>
      <P>Where it is considered that a customer's needs might be more appropriately addressed by another State agency, the customer is referred to that agency. Where the customer's circumstances appear to warrant it, for example, if he or she is unlikely to or incapable of initiating action, officials will make contact with the relevant agencies on their behalf.</P>
      <P>The monitoring of customers on a systematic basis in the interests of averting the sort of tragic events which occurred in the case referred to by the Deputy would be difficult for the Department in the context of the numbers involved.

      <P>As I pointed out in my <Col N="683" /> reply to the same question put down by the Deputy for answer on last Wednesday, homeless persons have the same entitlements as any other Irish citizen under the social welfare system. If they are unemployed but capable of and genuinely seeking work, then they can apply for unemployment assistance. They can be paid basic supplementary welfare allowance if they do not fulfil the conditions for any other primary weekly payment from my Department. In addition, they can also apply for payments such as rent supplementation, diet supplement and exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>One of the most important supports provided to homeless people through the social welfare system is assistance with rent deposits to enable them to secure private rented accommodation. Some £2 million was provided for rent deposits in 2000.</P>
      <P>The main policy initiative taken recently in relation to homelessness was the establishment of a cross-departmental team on the issue, under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The team also included representatives of my Department and the Departments of Education and Science, Finance, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Its report was published last year by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal and the main recommendations have been accepted by the Government. As a result, action plans for the delivery of services to homeless people are being drawn up by local authorities and health boards. Additional funding has been provided and a homeless forum is being established in each county, bringing together the statutory and voluntary agencies responding to the needs of homeless people.</P>
      <P>The Dublin action plan on homelessness was recently agreed and provides for the establishment of the Dublin Homeless Services Agency to co-ordinate and manage an integrated approach to the delivery of services to homeless people. My officials have been in contact with the agency with a view to ensuring that my Department contributes to improving the position of homeless people where possible.

      <P>Following the agreement <Col N="684" /> among the social partners in July 1998 on a pilot poverty proofing system to assess all significant policy proposals for their potential impact on the poor, the Government adopted this process in official Cabinet procedures. All memoranda for Government and key policy initiatives upon which significant policy decisions have to be made, are required to be poverty proofed and this has been the case since late 1998.</P>
      <P>The introduction of poverty proofing of significant policy proposals is a major tool in assisting this Government in halting the drift towards a two-tier society by keeping social inclusion to the fore in policy making at all times. It ensures that Departments are kept aware of the possible implications of policy on those most in need and it is a system this Government is committed to as part of its social inclusion strategy.</P>
      <P>To assist in the implementation of poverty proofing, the national anti-poverty strategy unit, based in my Department, produced a set of guidelines on poverty proofing and worked examples which were distributed to all Government Departments last year. The unit has also met with the strategy's liaison officers in all Government Departments and discussed poverty proofing with them in order to assist with any difficulties.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the poverty proofing arrangements are currently being reviewed by the National Economic and Social Council. The review is examining issues such as how the poverty proofing process might distinguish between large integrated programmes which consist of proposals from various Departments, and other more self-contained proposals. It is also assessing how the ongoing implementation of the poverty proofing process might be integrated with the broader policy proofing requirements, including equality proofing, rural proofing and eco-auditing.</P>
      <P>I expect that the outcome of the review, due in spring, will enhance the current process and help address any difficulties that may constrain its effective implementation. Following the review, my Department will consider further measures for improving the process, including possibilities for incorporating appropriate training modules into general service training courses.</P>
      <P>The Programme of Prosperity and Fairness also envisages the extension of poverty proofing on a phased basis to a local level through the local authorities and state agencies and this will be progressed following completion of the review.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to maternity and adoptive benefit is contingent, in the first instance, on the woman qualifying for maternity or adoptive leave under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 or the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, as appropriate. To introduce the extended leave it was necessary for the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce regulations to amend the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995. These regulations, which required a positive motion of approval to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, were introduced immediately after the Christmas recess. They were passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 8 February 2001 and immediately brought into force.</P>
      <P>Since the extensions of the maternity and adoptive leave provided for in the budget impose additional obligations on employers, it was necessary to give adequate advance notice and therefore, retrospective application of the provisions of these regulations was not possible. In addition, as both Acts require the woman to give her employer at least four weeks notice of her intention to take leave, the extended duration of maternity and adoptive leave can only apply to women who can give their employers the required four weeks notice following the commencement of the necessary regulations. Consequently, the new arrangements apply to anyone who goes on maternity or adoptive leave on or after 8 March 2001.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, it is not possible to provide for retrospective entitlement to the extended duration of maternity and adoptive leave, nor is it possible to provide for retrospective entitlement to maternity and adoptive benefits.</P>
      <P>The carer's benefit scheme which I introduced last October provides financial support for 15 months to a person who gives up employment to care full-time. As it is based on a person's PRSI contributions there is no means test. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for Labour Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, is introducing carer's leave legislation to protect the employment rights of the carer during that 15 month period. To qualify for carer's benefit, all of the qualifying conditions must be satisfied on or after 26 October 2000. This also applies to the condition that the applicant must have been in remunerative employment for the previous three month period on a full-time basis. As is the case in all new schemes, certain people may have qualified if the scheme had been introduced at an earlier date. It is difficult to decide on past entitlements in these type of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, my Department has introduced some flexibility to facilitate those employees who had already left the workplace before the commencement date. In this regard, employees who were <Col N="686" /> on annual leave, maternity leave, adoptive leave, parental leave or term-time leave immediately prior to their application will be eligible for carer's benefit and the three month remunerative employment period to be assessed will be the period prior to that leave. In addition, carers who took special or compassionate leave or a career break prior to the introduction of the carer's benefit scheme, for the purpose of caring, and with the agreement of their employer, may apply for carer's benefit. Certification of the caring situation will be required from the carer's employer and the care recipient's doctor. In such cases, a maximum period of six months prior to the introduction of carer's benefit application will be disregarded and the three months prior to that six-month period will be assessed for the purposes of carer's benefit.</P>

      <P>It is an important element of my Department's service to ensure that social welfare beneficiaries receive their full entitlements. A variety of means are used to provide information and advice and these are augmented from time to time in the light of experience.</P>
      <P>Information on entitlements is provided in a number of ways. It is disseminated in response to telephone and other enquiries, through booklets and leaflets which are available from a variety of sources, through radio and television interviews and articles in the newspapers.</P>
      <P>Information leaflets and booklets relating to each scheme are available from social welfare local offices where staff are in a position to provide detailed information on the full range of services available. Leaflets and booklets may also be obtained at post offices throughout the country.</P>
      <P>My Department also has an Internet site on which scheme information is readily available. It can be accessed at www.welfare.ie. Social Welfare information is also provided on RTE's Teletext information system, &ldquo;Aertel&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Comhairle, formerly the National Social Services Board and the independent voluntary sector also provide a very valuable information service to the public. They complement and enhance the information services provided at local level by the Department. The recent transfer of responsibility for Comhairle to the Department is part of an ongoing process aimed at improving information services to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The REACH agency is a cross-departmental agency established by the Government to <Col N="687" /> implement a programme for the electronic delivery of integrated public services to citizens. The provision of an improved information service is an important part of this and the agency is working with Comhairle to make available a database of up-to-date information on the full range of individual entitlements from different Government agencies.</P>
    <P>In addition to these general information services, my Department also advises current social welfare recipients and their dependents of their potential entitlements as they approach pension age.</P>

These changes substantially meet the recommendations of the Joint Committee's report. While no further changes are planned at this stage the situation will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The circular to which the Deputy refers was issued last August to give effect to an improvement in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The purpose of the initiative was to assist and encourage certain people to avail of full time work opportunities. The SWA scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insuf<Col N="688" /> ficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of this Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and all assessable cash income must be taken into account in order to determine eligibility.</P>
      <P>People who move from a welfare payment to participate in an approved employment programme are entitled to retain their rent-mortgage interest supplement on a reducing tapered basis over four years subject to a gross household income limit of £250 per week.</P>
      <P>In addition to this I decided last year that anyone who has been unemployed for 12 months or more and who moves from a welfare payment into a full-time job will also be allowed to retain their rent-mortgage interest supplement subject to the same regulations pertaining to those participating in the employment programmes. The purpose of this initiative was to assist and encourage people who were not eligible to participate in an employment programme to avail of full time work opportunities.</P>
      <P>SWA Circular No. 8/2000 was issued last August to the community welfare staff in the health boards who administer the SWA scheme to inform them of this new initiative. I am not aware of problems or difficulties resulting from the implementation of the circular in the various health board areas. However, if the Deputy has concerns about a particular case he might supply me with the details so that I can have inquiries made into the situation.</P>

      <P>As announced in budget 2001, the free schemes are to be extended from May 2001 to all persons aged 70 years and over, regardless of their income or household composition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project to implement this extension of the schemes involves the processing of an estimated 80,000 claims from some 43,000 new customers. The staffing and other needs to implement the <Col N="689" /> project have been identified and work is under way to have these staff in place as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The extension of the schemes will be advertised in the press during the week commencing 4 March 2001 and customers will be invited to apply on a special application form to the pension services office of my Department in Sligo. That office will provide a Freephone facility from 5 March 2001 for at least two weeks. Alternatively the office can be contacted by e-mail. All of this information will be contained in the press advertisement.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for the customers to make an application as the majority of them are new customers and the allowances cannot be applied to their bills by the various utility companies unless my Department supplies all the relevant details including account numbers.</P>
    <P>Because of the scale of the project it will not be possible to arrange to have the various allowances applying to all customers bills from 1 May 2001 but the allowances will be put into effect at the earliest possible date and will be backdated to 1 May where applicable.</P>

      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by health boards which administer the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on behalf of my Department. The SWA scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>Where a person has access to some resources either in cash or in kind this is taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who are being provided with full board accommodation under the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Direct provision came into effect on 10 April 2000.</P>
      <P>Where a person in direct provision receives all meals and has access to other facilities such as laundry and leisure areas the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per child. These rates are currently under review by a working group which I established to examine certain issues related to the assessment of need for supplementary welfare allowance purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, as is the case with all persons who are resident in the state where there are <Col N="690" /> other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments will be made by the health board.</P>
    <P>Asylum seekers who have not been provided with full board accommodation in direct provision and who have no other means qualify for the full standard rate of weekly SWA. This amounts to £76.00 per week for a single adult, £123.00 per week for a couple and £13.20 per week for a dependent child. Asylum seekers who arrived in the State prior to the introduction of direct provision and who live in private rented accommodation qualify for rent supplement on the same basis as other recipients. For example, a single person living in Dublin can receive up to £70 per week towards rent, while a family can receive up to £190 per week, depending on the number of people in the family.</P>
    <P>At present there are 8,598 supplementary welfare allowance claims in respect of over 14,000 asylum seekers. Of these, just over 2,700 claims covering almost 4,200 people are in respect of people in direct provision and they receive the reduced allowance as outlined. In addition, there are 1,010 asylum seekers covered by unemployment assistance claims and the payment rates are equivalent to SWA rates. A small number of asylum seekers are in receipt of other social welfare payments such as one-parent family payments, pensions or disability allowance. Asylum seekers and refugees are also entitled to child benefit at the standard rate in respect of their children. The monthly rate is £42.50 for the first and second child increasing to £56 for third and subsequent children.</P>

      <P>Child poverty has been identified as a central issue for consideration in the review of the national anti-poverty strategy provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. As part of the review, existing NAPS targets will be revised as appropriate and consideration will be given to possible new targets under the themes of child poverty, women's poverty, older people, health, and housing-accommodation.</P>
      <P>The most recent independent survey carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute shows that the level of consistent poverty among children has dropped to 12% &ndash; a fall of almost 30 per cent in the twelve month period from 1997 to 1998. This accelerates the downward trend in child poverty figures with consistent poverty among children halved from 24.8% in 1987 to 12% in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drop in consistent poverty among children is largely attributable to this Government's suc<Col N="691" /> cess in reducing unemployment to under 4% through the development of work friendly policies and the provision of supports which facilitate the transition from unemployment to employment.</P>
    <P>In the area of child income supports, the massive injection of funds into the child benefit scheme provided for in the 2001 budget underlines the Government's commitment in this area. At a full-year cost of almost £329 million, the budget provides for unprecedented increases of £25 per month for the first two children and £30 per month for third and subsequent children. In addition, the increases will be paid three months earlier &ndash; from next June. I look forward to fully meeting the commitment we gave in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness by further increasing child benefit, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>More generally, the Deputy will be aware that the social welfare benchmarking and indexation working group &ndash; established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness &ndash; is examining the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments. An interim report is due from this group in April this year, with a final report due later in the year. The group's findings will inform the future development of policy in this critical area.</P>

      <P>Last December's budget provided for the implementation of the increases in the weekly rates of social welfare payments to be brought forward by four weeks to the beginning of April 2001 to coincide with the start of the tax year. In addition, I have already announced that this alignment of tax and social welfare changes will be maintained when the tax year is brought forward by 13 weeks to coincide with the calendar year from January 2002. This will mean that the increases in social welfare weekly rates will have been brought forward by 23 weeks, over five months, since the Government came into office.</P>
      <P>In addition, the substantial increases in monthly child benefit announced in the budget are being paid three months earlier, from June this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of bringing forward the implementation dates of the increases in weekly social wel<Col N="692" /> fare rates to January 2001 will depend on the level of increases provided in the next budget.

    <P>However, by way of illustration, the cost of bringing forward the increases in the weekly social welfare rates and the consequential FIS improvements provided in last December's budget by a further 13 weeks would have been in the region of £112 million or 142 million. The cost of bringing forward the increases in monthly child benefit provided in the December budget by each further month would be £27.4 million or 34.8 million.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to extending pension cover to as many categories as possible. In recent years more flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension scheme.</P>
      <P>Measures already introduced include the reduction in 1997 in the average number of PRSI contributions required for pension purposes to ten; the provision in 1999 of a special half rate pension for self employed contributors who were already over 56 years of age in 1988 when compulsory social insurance was introduced for this group; and the payment of another special half rate pension, introduced in 2000, based on pre-53 insurance contributions. These measures are making it easier for people, particularly women, with reduced or broken insurance records to receive a contributory pension.</P>
      <P>At present it is estimated that about 90% of women over 65 years of age are receiving a social welfare payment. Of these 87 per cent have a payment in their own right with about 62 per cent of those who have a payment receiving one based on their PRSI record. While recognising that the social insurance system cannot cover all gaps in pension coverage, nevertheless, as I indicated in my speech on the budget more needs to be done in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, the existing homemaker's scheme, which is intended to protect the pension entitlements of those who take time out of the paid workforce to care for children or sick relatives, is being reviewed. This and other issues, <Col N="693" /> including the cost and administrative implications, is being considered in the context of the second phase of the review of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions which has just commenced. I expect to receive the working group's report later this year.</P>
    <P>The Government also decided to increase the rate of the qualified adult allowance for those over 66 years of age to the full old age noncontributory pension rate. A major step towards this objective was taken in budget 2001 by providing an increase of £15 per week in the full rate qualified adult allowance.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the report of the PPF working group which is currently examining the issues of administrative individualisation, arrangements will be put in place so that part of the pension can be paid directly to the qualified adult as a homemaker's pension.</P>

      <P>The most immediate measure which member states are required to take to achieve the social inclusion aims set out in the social policy agenda is to draw up a two year national action plan to combat exclusion by 1 June this year. This will be based on objectives agreed by the European Council in Nice in December.</P>
      <P>For each objective the progress aimed for by national policies is to be set out. It was also agreed that the indicators used to assess the results of the action undertaken should be listed in the plan.</P>
      <P>Ireland is fortunate in already having structures and processes in place under the national anti-poverty strategy, which effectively can take on the preparation and implementation of the national action plan. An official in the national poverty unit has been appointed to co-ordinate preparation of the plan, in liaison with the officials representing Ireland on the EU Social Protection Committee. This committee has overall responsibility for co-ordinating preparation of the plans EU wide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A seminar on the process has been arranged <Col N="694" /> for 9 March which will be attended by officials of the relevant services of the EU Commission and representatives of the relevant stakeholders in Ireland. The purpose of the seminar is to have an open exchange of information and debate about the process.</P>
    <P>A review of the NAPS is also already under way under Framework III of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The findings of this review, due for completion in September, which are available by June will be fully taken into account in drawing up the national action plan.</P>
    <P>The many developments across a wide range of relevant policy areas currently in train and the commitments entered into in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will form the basis for our national action plan. The progress we intend to achieve in these areas over the next two years will be set down, together with new areas of action considered necessary, and the ways we intend to measure the progress being achieved.</P>
    <P>It is also our intention to fully avail under the EU Commission action programme of the opportunities available to exchange experiences, information and good practices with other member states. We have much to learn from these member states in this regard, some of whom have the best systems of social protection in the world, combining both high employment rates and low levels of social exclusion. Likewise we have much to share of our own experience, given our recent economic and social progress. The European Union is embarking on a major concerted effort to combat poverty and social exclusion and Ireland is well prepared and determined to take our full part in this most worthy process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 to 96, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department is the designated managing authority for two of the operational programmes under the national development plan. The productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development operational programme. In addition, my Department has also, responsibility for micro-enterprises in the two regional operational programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The productive sector operational programme receives co-financing from two funds administered by the EU, the European Regional <Col N="701" /> Development Fund, ERDF, and the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, FIFG. In relation to European Regional Development Fund the Directorate General involved is DG Regio and in relation to FIFG it is DG Fish. The lead official for the EU Commission Services is Mr. Manfred Beschel of DG Regio.</P>
    <P>Five meetings have taken place between Irish officials and the EU Commission which related to the community support framework and not the individual operational programmes. These meetings covered the overall contribution being made by the EU to the national development plan. Three meetings took place between officials of the EU Commission and officials from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources in relation to specific supports under the Productive Sector Operational Programme.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee, which oversees the operational programme, held its first meeting on 23 November, 2000.</P>
    <P>No consultants have been engaged by my Department to assist with the design or implementation of the productive sector operational programme. The structure of the productive sector is that there are four priorities covered which are, research, technological development and innovation; industry &ndash; indigenous and foreign direct investment; marketing and sea fisheries development. The total OP allocation over the plan is £7.3 billion. These priorities are further broken down into 21 measures which are further broken down into 41 sub-measures. These sub-measures are administered by the relevant bodies with responsibility for the particular areas and contain numerous projects which will receive funding under the national development plan. At this time it is not possible to ascertain the exact number of projects. Some of the measures are competitive and the projects themselves are evaluated only at time of application.</P>
    <P>Six departmental staff, a principal officer, two assistant principals, one higher executive officer, one executive officer and one clerical officer are working full or part time on operational programme management co-ordination. The monitoring committee of the operational programme has responsibility for the implementation of the programme. There are 42 different bodies involved together with my Department. These include, Government departments, the EU Commission, implementing agencies, regional assemblies, regional authorities, employers-business representatives, trade unions, farming representatives and the community and voluntary pillar. No other bodies have been consulted or contacted in regard to the implementation of the operational programme. There are no public-private partnerships envisaged at this time.</P>
    <P>Unit B.3 of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Employment and Social Affairs has the direct Commission responsibility for assisting in and monitoring the implemen<Col N="702" /> tation of the Employment And Human Resources Development Operational Programme. The head of unit is Vassiliki Kolotourou; Luis Riara is the head of the DG's Directorate B. Since the publication of the NDP in November 1999, the relevant officials on both sides would have met up to ten times and, most recently, last week. No consultants have been hired by my Department to assist with its design or implementation of the Human Resources Development OP.</P>
    <P>The OP is almost exclusively multi-annual programme rather than project-based; that is the essential mode of delivery is the provision of publicly-funded education or training programmes over the period to 2006. In the social economy area, however, a project-based approached is being used; it is projected that there will be more than 400 projects over the OP lifetime. Significant expenditure is planned on construction work, particularly by the Department of Education and Science to provide the facilities needed for educational courses on more than 2,500 projects of all sizes.</P>
    <P>Five Department staff, a principal, one assistant principal, one higher executive officer, an executive officer and a clerical officer is working full or part-time on OP management co-ordination. The total OP allocation over the plan for the social economy field is £348.8 million and for supporting infrastructure it is £2,507.8 million of which £2,435.4 million is for the education sector. It is not possible to predict the budgeted costs of the individual projects to be funded in either context; many of the social economy projects to be supported have yet to be proposed while the education projects are all of different scale.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee of the OP has responsibility for the unemployment of the programme. My Department is in regular contact with at least twenty-five groups and bodies in respect of its implementation and management. These include, Departments, the EU Commission, implementing agencies, regional assemblies, regional authorities, employers-business representatives, trade unions, farming representatives and the community and voluntary pillar.</P>
    <P>No proposals for public private partnership or potential possibilities for such were set out in the text of this operational programme which relates essentially to the education and training of people. I do not expect that situation will change over the implementation period for this OP to 2006.</P>
    <P>The Micro Enterprises (Regional Operational Programmes) are carried out by the 35 city and county enterprise boards, is dealt with under the local enterprise development sub-programmes of the Border, midlands and western, BMW, and the southern and eastern regional operational programmes of the national development plan. The managing authorities for these programmes is the regional assembly for each region.</P>
    <P>My Department has not hired consultants to assist with the design or implementation of the <Col N="703" /> national development plan in relation to the micro-enterprise measure.</P>
    <P>There are ten personnel working on micro-enterprise related work in the Department; one principal officer, two assistant principals &ndash; one full-time and one part-time &ndash; one higher executive officer, three executive officers, four clerical officers and 35 city and county enterprise boards. The budget for the measure is £190.5 million over the period of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>My Department is in regular contact with the 35 city and county enterprise boards and with the Departments of Agriculture Food and Rural Development, Environment and Local Government and Finance. There is no public-private partnerships provision for micro-enterprise supports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, conditions of employment in excess of statutory entitlements are not regulated by law but are determined by negotiation and agreement between employers and employees or a trade union acting on their behalf. Any dispute arising in relation to the operation of sick pay schemes or authorised absences from employment fall, therefore, to be settled either between the parties involved or by availing of the State's industrial relations dispute settling machinery as provided for under the Industrial Relations Acts. In the event of the employees being unable to resolve their difficulties with management on this issue it would be open to them to refer the matter to the <Col N="705" /> Labour Relations Commission for investigation under the Industrial Relations Acts.</P>
      <P>Anyone who works for an employer for a regular wage or salary has automatically a contract of employment whether written or not. A contract of employment, for the purposes of employment legislation, may be expressed or implied, oral or in writing. Many of the terms of a contract of employment may emerge from the common law, statutes or collective agreements made through trade unions or may be derived from the custom or practice in a particular industry.</P>
      <P>The Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994 which has effect from 16 May 1994, requires employers to provide employees with a written statement of certain particulars of the employee's terms of employment. The Act, in general, applies to any person working under a contract of employment or apprenticeship; employed through an employment agency or in the service of the State including members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, civil servants and employees of any local authority, health board, harbour authority or vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>The Act does not apply to a person who is normally required to work for the employer for less than eight hours a week or who has been in the continuous service of the employer for less than one month.</P>
      <P>In the case of agency workers, the party who pays the wages, employment agency or client company is the employer for the purposes of this Act and is responsible for providing the written statement.</P>
      <P>The written statement of particulars must be provided by the employer within two months of the date of commencement of employment. In the case of employees whose employment commenced before 16 May 1994, the commencement date of the Act, the written statement must be provided by the employer within two months of being requested to do so by the employee.</P>
      <P>The written statement, which is not, of itself, a contract must include particulars of the terms of employment relating to the name and address of the employer, the place of work, job title-nature of the work, date of commencement of employment, nature of contract, temporary or fixed term, pay and pay intervals, hours of work, including overtime, paid leave, incapacity for work due to sickness or injury, pensions and pension schemes, notice entitlements, collective agreements.</P>
      <P>The Act provides a right of complaint to a Rights Commissioner where an employee believes that his or her employer has failed to provide a written statement in accordance with the terms of the Act or failed to notify the employee of changes to the particulars contained in the statement. There is a right of appeal by either party to the Employment Appeals Tribunal from a recommendation of a rights commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> However, I would encourage employers in circumstances such as those outlined by the Deputy in this question, to take a fair and compassionate approach to facilitating employees in such difficult circumstances.</P>

      <P>Following discussions with the European Commission, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, announced in March last significant increases, averaging 30%, in the rates of annual forest premium for those planting from 1 October 1999.</P>
      <P>However, despite protracted negotiations, the European Commission refused to agree to similar increases for those who planted before that date. I am now considering possible funding from the Exchequer for those affected. The estimated annual cost at present is approximately £3.4 million.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 to 107, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources does not in general deal directly with <Col N="708" /> the European Commission in relation to the monitoring and implementation of the marine and natural resources elements of the national development plan. This function is undertaken by the managing authority for the NDP/CSF, that is the Department of Finance, and, for each Operational Programme, the Southern and Eastern Assembly in respect of the southern and eastern regional OP, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in respect of the employment and human resources OP, etc.</P>
    <P>The monitoring of the NDP-CSF and the operational programmes is undertaken by monitoring committees which are chaired by the relevant managing authority. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and other implementing bodies are represented on each operational programme monitoring committee. The European Commission serves in an advisory capacity on these committees. The following officials of the European Commission, who deal with the Department's measures, are represented on one or more of those committees:</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Mr. Pedro Tarno</P>
    <P>Head of Unit</P>
    <P>Directorate General for Fish</P>
    <P>Mr. Tony Meaney</P>
    <P>Desk Officer</P>
    <P>Directorate General for Fish</P>
    <P>Ms Isabel de Almeida</P>
    <P>Directorate General for Agriculture</P>
    <P>Mr. John Lougheed</P>
    <P>Deputy Head of Unit</P>
    <P>Directorate General for Agriculture</P>
    <P>Mr. Joe Buckley</P>
    <P>Directorate General for Regional Policy</P>
    <P>Ms Elisabeth Slavkoff,</P>
    <P>Directorate General for Regional Policy</P>
    <P>Maire Ní Quirk</P>
    <P>Directorate General for Employment</P>
    <P>Denis Kennedy</P>
    <P>Directorate General for Employment</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Each monitoring committee has met on one occasion to date.</P>
    <P>In addition to monitoring committee meetings my Department's forest service, which is the paying authority and implementation body for the purposes of the afforestation measure of the CAP Rural Development Plan, 2000-06, has had several meetings with European Commission officials since the publication of the plan. My Department's sea fisheries policy and development division, which is the paying authority and implementation body for the purposes of the fisheries measures of the productive sector operational programme, has had one meeting with European Commission officials since the publication of the plan.</P>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to consultants engaged by my Department to assist with the design or implementation of the NDP s set out as follows:</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Department's licensing terms for offshore oil and gas exploration and development 1992 when a commercial discovery has been established it will be the duty of the authority holder to so notify the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources and to apply forthwith for a petroleum lease with a view to its development. Enterprise Energy Ireland having discovered gas in the Corrib field off the Mayo coast declared the field commercial last January and applied to me for a petroleum lease to develop it. This lease application is still under consideration in my Department. Such applications shall include the outline development proposals, financial and marketing plan for the exploitation of the discovery based on the applicant's considered likely production profile and an outline statement of the likely effects on the proposed development on the environment. Before a lease can be issued by me I must be satisfied by reference to the likely production profile and the applicants outline development, financial and marketing plans that a commercial discovery has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a lease has been issued the leaseholder is obliged, under the licensing terms, to submit to me within two years of the date of issue of the petroleum lease a detailed plan of development in a format specified by me but including a detailed production profile for the life of the field for my approval. The legislative framework governing petroleum exploration and development is the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development <Col N="714" /> Act, 1960, as amended. Section 13A of this Act requires that the plan of Development submitted for my approval under the terms of a lease must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement, EIS. The grant of the petroleum lease will therefore take place prior to my giving approval to either a plan of development or the environmental impact statement.</P>
    <P>The grant of a petroleum lease does not authorise in any way the lessee to engage in any development work leading to or associated with the extraction of oil or gas. Any such development work can only occur following the approval of the plan of development and the environmental impact statement.</P>

      <P>The pier at Clogherhead is owned by Louth County Council and responsibility for its maintenance and development lies with the local authority. Accordingly, it is a matter for the county council in the first instance to bring forward proposals for capital investment. Funding of £125,000 was provided last year to the county council to support essential safety and maintenance works.</P>
      <P>In 1998 Louth County Council commissioned consulting engineers to carry out a technical assessment of the development needs of the harbour. Their report, which examined a range of options, recommended extending the pier, the construction of a breakwater and dredging works. The cost of these capital works was estimated at that time to be in excess of £3 million.</P>
      <P>Any major capital investment proposed would require, in the first instance, comprehensive cost benefit analysis having regard to all relevant economic and socio-economic factors, trends in volume and value of landings, the extent to which displacement is a factor, fleet trends and regional and local considerations. It is also the case that existing funding for major fishery harbour development work is oversubscribed. Development options in relation to Clogherhead will be kept under review in that context, and my Department will be consulting further with Louth County Council on the way forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>In May 1998, the Government approved the development of a light rail system for Dublin and decided that priority should be given to lines from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green. In accordance with that decision, I have granted light railway orders for these lines following public inquiry processes. I published an indicative timetable for the delivery of the project and set a target date of summer 2003 for the completion of construction of the line between Sandyford and St. Stephen's Green, line B. Work to date on the line is on schedule for meeting that target.</P>
      <P>Preparatory works on the line began in November 1999 and are now well advanced, particularly on the old Harcourt Street railway line section. The main construction contract involving the track laying and the mechanical and electrical installations for all of the lines will be awarded within the coming weeks. This contract includes the construction of a depot at Sandyford where the trams for line B will be stabled.</P>
      <P>In January 2001, I announced the commencement of a competition to select an operator for the light rail lines. That competition, which has attracted expressions of interest from Ireland, the UK, Europe and the USA, is well under way and I expect to announce the selected operator in October 2001.</P>
      <P>In July 2000, the Government approved, in principle, the development of a metro system for Dublin. As part of that decision it was agreed that line B would be integrated into the metro system by providing for tunnel construction at Ranelagh and for the upgrading of the line to fully segregated operation. Immediately following the Government decision, I asked the Light Rail Project Office, LRPO, to carry out the necessary preparatory work for the metro. That work has involved the incorporation of the technical specifications for metro into the light rail designs, so that there will be minimum disruption of services when the metro upgrade occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> The track being laid for the light rail line will also be used for the metro system and there will be no question of having to take up the line. A detailed implementation plan for the metro system is currently being developed by the LRPO which will then form the basis of a submission to Government for approval.</P>

It is proposed that the staff of the Light Rail Project Office, LRPO, which currently has responsibility for the development of the first Luas lines, will transfer to the agency. The overall staffing levels of the agency will be a matter for the agency to determine after it is established.</P>
      <P>The Light Rail Project Office has begun the process of identifying the likely financial requirements of the agency for its first years of operation. The location of the headquarters of the new body will be a matter for the agency to decide after it has been established.</P>

      <P>I presented the report of the Integrated Ticketing Committee, Proposal for Integrated Ticketing in the Greater Dublin Area, to the Government on 21 November 2000. The report indicates that the recommended system could be introduced first on Luas, Bus Átha Cliath and suburban rail in 2003. The report also estimates the capital cost of introducing the recommended system on Bus Átha Cliath and suburban rail at £25 million and recommends that a marketing budget of £10 million should be made available, as part of the overall capital budget for the project, to encourage customers to switch from cash to smart card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Light Rail Project Office is currently drawing up an implementation plan for the project as part of the Luas development. That office is also in discussion with Bus Átha Cliath, which is also <Col N="721" /> proceeding with its plans, and the Light Rail Project Office will be in touch with other operators and interested parties. The responsibilities of the Light Rail Project Office will be assigned to the proposed rail procurement agency which will be established under a Bill to be published shortly and the agency will co-ordinate the overall approach to integrated ticketing. The national development plan makes provision for expenditure of £50 million on integration, including integrated ticketing, over the period 2000-06 and the allocation of this funding will be determined on the basis of the implementation of the plan as it is developed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126, 128 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has overall responsibility for the public transport, regional airports, and energy and communications measures in the national development plan. However, the individual projects are being implemented by agencies and companies in the relevant sectors. The broad nature of my Department's responsibility makes it difficult to give very precise responses to the questions.</P>
      <P>In relation to the EU Commission involvement, for example, there is ongoing and regular contact with senior officials in a number of directorates. These would include but not be limited to the Directorate General for Regional Policy and also the Directorate General for Transport and Energy. Similarly, a very substantial proportion of staff at all levels within the Department, while not working exclusively with national development plan programmes are involved in overseeing or assisting the implementation of these projects. Staff, usually at principal officer level, also participate in the formal monitoring committees that are chaired by either the Department of Finance or the Department of Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>My Department also consults with or is in regular contact with a wide range of groups in relation to the national development plan. These range from other Department and companies involved in implementing projects to local interest groups. It also includes a large number of agencies, both national and regional, including the full range of regional authorities, development boards, chambers of commerce and other relevant organisations.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is as follows. In July 2000 my Department engaged a consortium comprising Masons Solicitors, Booz-Allen Hamilton and Babtie Group to design and conduct the competition to select an operator for light rail services in Dublin. The consortium will receive a maximum fee of £1,254,668 for this project, to be completed in October 2001. <Col N="723" /> Consultants, Currie and Brown in conjunction with Ernst and Young have been contracted, at a cost of £94,100, to develop a project management system for the public transport investment programme of £2.2 billion.</P>
      <P>My Department has hired Norcontel (Ireland) Ltd., to assist in the implementation of the e-commerce and communications projects of the national development plan costing approximately £155 million comprising of public and private funds. Norcontel (Ireland) Ltd., will receive a maximum fee of £186,150 over a two year period in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>A PPP approach is being taken to the operation of the Luas light rail system, due to commence revenue services in 2003. The competition for the award of the operating franchise began in December 2000 and the successful bidder will be known by Autumn 2001. The financial aspects of the contract will be negotiated as part of the competition process and the overriding consideration will be to ensure that the outcome of the process yields best value for money for the State and for the travelling public.</P>
      <P>Although not within the national development plan, the Government has also approved, in principle, the development, on a PPP basis, of a metro system for Dublin. The metro is one of the elements contained in the Dublin Transportation Office strategy for 2000-16. The DTO has also recommended a PPP approach to a number of the rail-based proposals in the strategy.</P>
      <P>To ensure that these proposals are given sufficient focus, I propose to establish a railway procurement agency whose responsibility will be the procurement of new railway infrastructure. I propose to introduce the Bill providing for the establishment of the new agency to the Oireachtas in the coming weeks. The Bill will provide that the agency can procure rail infrastructure through the PPP approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to funding of capital projects in the Kildare South constituency is as follows: With regard to public transport, the Government is committed to investment in the public transport system. The national development plan provides for the investment of £1.6 billion to improve the public transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area &ndash; including enhanced services in the Kildare-Carlow area. In early 2000, Iarnród Éireann ordered 60 new diesel rail cars under the national development plan for delivery in 2002-03 to provide for enhanced suburban rail services in the greater Dublin area. These new diesel rail cars will be used to enhance commuter services in the greater Dublin area including south County Kildare. I understand that Iarnród Éireann also ordered for delivery in 2003 a further 20 diesel rail cars to enhance Dublin commuter services in late 2000. Many of the benefits of investment in public transport, particularly on railway infrastructure, cross county boundaries and, in general, it is not possible to associate investment with individual counties.</P>
      <P>I understand Iarnród Éireann recently placed a contract for the renewal of Monasterevin station at a cost of £2.5 million. It is anticipated that this project will be completed by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>In addition, Iarnród Éireann recently submitted proposals, costed at in excess of £200 million, to my Department for the upgrade of the rail line between Kildare and Heuston. The proposal is designed to allow an increased number of commuter trains operate between Kildare and Heuston station. These proposals are currently being examined in my Department.</P>
      <P>With regard to energy efficiency, my Department, through the Irish Energy Centre, funded one energy project in the Kildare South Constituency, Athy, in 2000. The amount of funding was £3,840, which was the final tranche of a grant of £19,200 approved in previous years under the energy efficiency investment support scheme under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme 1994-99. This scheme encouraged industry and commercial property owners to invest in energy efficient technologies. It is not possible, at this stage, to identify the equivalent 2001 projects under the programme.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to capital projects funded by my Department in the South Kerry constituency in 2000 is as follows. With regard to public transport, the Government is committed to investment in the public transport system. The national development plan provides for the investment of over £2.5 billion to improve the public transport infrastructure throughout the country. Many of the benefits of investment in public transport, particularly on railway infrastructure, cross county boundaries and, in general, it is not possible to associate investment with individual counties.</P>
      <P>I understand from Iarnród Éireann that in the South Kerry constituency last year, 15 miles of rail track on the Mallow to Tralee line were upgraded by the replacement of old jointed rail track with continuous welded tracks on concrete sleepers. This work cost £6 million. The company plans to upgrade a further eight miles of track between Killarney and Tralee in 2001. This work is estimated to cost £3.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following energy efficiency projects were funded: A 15.19 megawatt wind energy electricity plant at Tursillagh, Tralee, County Kerry was constructed with the assistance of an offer of a grant of £945,000 from the European Regional Development Fund. A 3.94 megawatt wind energy electricity plant at Beenageeha, Kilflynn, Listowel, County Kerry was constructed with assistance of an offer of a grant of £270,700 from the European Regional Development Fund. In addition, I understand that a 1.65 megawatt wind energy electricity plant at Beal Hill, Ballybunion, County Kerry was constructed with assistance from the European Union's fourth framework programme, THERMIE Measure, paid directly <Col N="726" /> by the European Union. It is understood that an offer of support of £471,000 was approved by the European Commission in this regard.</P>

      <P>Military service allowance and security duty allowance <Col N="728" /> were introduced for the Permanent Defence Force in 1979 and 1974 respectively. Military service allowance was introduced to compensate for the hardship, danger and discipline aspects of military life. Security duty allowance was introduced to compensate for exceptional duties over and above the normal peacetime pattern of military duties. Prior to 1989, the position was that some members of the Reserve Defence Force, including First Line Reserve and An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, were called up and engaged on full-time duties. Military service allowance was not paid to members of the Reserve Defence Forces engaged on full-time security duties. A limited review of the Departmental records undertaken in the time available indicates that security duty allowance was paid to members of the Reserve Defence Force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a tender competition which was conducted in strict compliance with Government procurement procedures, a contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of Switzerland of 40 armoured personnel carriers, APCs, initial spares, special tools and training courses. The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha III 8 x 8s, are being manufactured as 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery variant and one ambulance variant. The total cost of the contract, which is spread over five years, is in the region of £40 million, including VAT.</P>
      <P>The Piranha III 8 x 8 APC troop carrier has a crew of two, a driver and a gunner, and accommodation for nine other personnel. The vehicle is fitted with a Helio, UK, turret. The turret is a one man turret fitted with a 0.5, 12.7 millimetre, heavy machine gun and a 7.62 millimetre coaxial machine gun. The APC comprises state of the art technology in running gear and protection concepts. It is fitted with a Mercedes turbocharged aftercooled diesel engine developing 400 Hp@2300 revs/minute and has a gross weight of 18,500 kilograms. The maximum speed is 105 km/h and the vehicle has a cruising range of 600 kilometres. The Piranha III 8 x 8 has a hydrope numatic suspension system which allows the vehicle to be operated at three different height levels &ndash; high, normal and low &ndash; above ground. It has anti-lock brakes for on and off road use and a central tyre inflation system, CTIS, which allows the driver to inflate or deflate the tyres while on the move. The vehicle is fitted with an air conditioning and a vehicle heating system. The APCs will be fitted with SINCGAR radios.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> The command variant is based on the troop variant with the same turret and the same characteristics. It has a crew of two, driver and gunner, and can accommodate five personnel in the rear operating at map boards and a foldable table. The recovery variant is based on the troop variant but without a turret. It has a crew of three, driver, commander and mechanic. It is fitted with a winch, a vehicle anchoring and stabiliser system and a variety of on board recovery equipment and tools. The ambulance variant is based on the troop variant but without a turret. It has a crew of three, driver, commander and doctor-medical attendant. It is fitted with a rack stretcher system which can accommodate different numbers of casualties, depending or whether they are seated or lying down. The ambulance variant is also fitted with a variety of medical equipment. The primary objective in acquiring the APCs is to provide adequate protection for Defence Forces personnel participating in United Nations mandated peace support operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the person named did not submit a 2000 area aid application, his entitlement to grants under the 2000 premia schemes is limited to payment on up to 15 livestock units in accordance with the terms and conditions governing these schemes. He submitted an application under the 2000 special beef premium scheme and he was paid his full entitlement of £2,107.47 in respect of 12.6 livestock units. While he applied on eight suckler cows under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme, his entitlement was accordingly restricted to 2.4 livestock units and he has been paid his full entitlement of £353.73 under this scheme. The first advance, 60%, of £212.24 issued to him on 30 November 2000; the second advance, 20%, of £70.74 issued to him on 19 December 2000 and the balancing payment of £70.75 issued to him on 31 January 2001.</P>
      <P>The person named applied on 27 animals under the 2000 cattle headage scheme. Clause 23 of the terms and conditions governing the scheme provides that an applicant must have submitted an area aid application in order to receive grants. Consequently, as no 2000 area aid application has been received by my Department from the person named, he is not entitled to any grants under this scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if he will intervene on behalf of a person (details supplied) and waive all penalties applied on his 2000 suckler cow-cattle headage in view of the fact that he made a genuine error duplicating a tag number; the reason he received payment on only 48 ani mals and not 49; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The person named applied for premium on 40 cows and ten heifers under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme and 40 beef cows under the 2000 cattle headage scheme on 8 May 2000. When the application was being processed it was discovered that a cow bearing tag number UGA 546125 was entered twice on the application. In accordance with the regulations, the animal bearing this tag was deleted from the application without penalty leaving the remaining 39 cows eligible for payment. As animal bearing tag number WJWN0078F was not listed on the original claim, it could not be considered for payment unless it was accepted as a replacement.</P>
      <P>Under the terms and conditions of the suckler cow scheme, an applicant is entitled to apply on up to 20% of the total number of animals applied on as heifers. The person in question applied on ten heifers. However, as he was deemed to have 39 eligible cows for payment he was therefore entitled to payment on nine heifers under the 20% rule.</P>
      <P>The person in question was notified of the discrepancy regarding the duplicate tag on 12 July 2000 and was advised that payment would be reduced. He then sought a review of the case on 18 July 2000. The review upheld the original decision. A letter notifying the applicant of the outcome of the review issued on 8 September 2000. A notice of appeal was received in the appeals unit on 26 September 2000 and the result of this investigation was that the penalty was properly applied. He was notified of these findings on 1 February 2001.</P>
      <P>It was, therefore, established that the person named was entitled to payment on 39 suckler cows and nine heifers under the 2000 suckler cow scheme and, accordingly, was paid a total of £7,074.72 as follows: 60% advance, £88.434 × 48 = £4,244.83 on 14 December 2000; 20% balance, £29.478 × 48 = £1,414.94 on 19 December 2000; 20% balance, £29.478×48 = £1,414.95 on 31 January 2001. The penalties applied in this case are part of the regulations laid down by the EU. The person named did not suffer any penalty under the 2000 cattle headage scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the new scheme of investment aid for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards grant aid is available to assist dairy farmers to provide new and upgraded dairying facilities and milking equipment on their farms. Grant aid is payable at the rate of 40% to dairy farmers with up to 150 income units, while farmers with more than 150 income units and up to a maximum of 200 income units are eligible for a 20% rate of grant. The maximum investment eligible for grant is £25,000. The grant rates are increased in respect of all investments, with the exception of milking machines and new bulk milk tanks, by 15% in less favoured areas and by 5% in other areas in the case of young trained farmers under 35 years of age who have undertaken the investments within five years of setting up in farming.</P>

      <P>A participant in the REP scheme undertakes to carry out farming activities for a five year period in accordance with an agri-environmental plan prepared to conform with the agri-environmental specifications published by my Department. The agri-environmental plan is prepared by an approved REPS planner in consultation with and with the agreement of the farmer. Failure to comply with any of the <Col N="736" /> measures set out in the agri-environmental plan and specifications is a breach of the scheme and may result in a penalty being imposed on the applicant.</P>
      <P>This participant's agri-environmental plan required the construction of waste storage facilities by the third year of the plan. A pre-payment compliance inspection carried out on 20 March 2000 noted that the planned waste storage facilities had not been provided. In the circumstances my Department had no option but to impose the appropriate penalty.</P>
      <P>The person named has exercised his right to appeal the penalty to the national REPS appeals committee. The committee is independent and its decisions are final. I understand that the outcome of the appeal will be communicated to the person named shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 to 160, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following table indicates those measures and their indicative public funding allocations under the national development plan for which my Department and State agencies under its aegis have responsibility. Details of personnel within my Department involved in the implementation of the plan are given at the foot of the table. The majority of these measures are being implemented and I expect to launch the remainder shortly. As the measures consist mainly of <Col N="738" /> demand-led schemes, it is not possible at this stage to state the number of projects that will be assisted under them.</P>
    <P>As the table indicates, the measures comprise either part of the CAP rural development plan or one or more operational programmes. That plan and those programmes have monitoring committees which include relevant social partners and interest groups. Through prior consultation on the measures and participation in the monitoring process, my Department has and will continue to have regular contact or consultation with some 26 statutory and non-statutory groups.</P>
    <P>Within the European Commission, the Directorate General for Agriculture has responsibility for monitoring the implementation of the agriculture, food, and related rural development measures of the national development plan. The senior EU official involved is Mr. A. Korakas, Director &ndash; Directorate F11, Rural Development 11. Since the publication of the plan, my Department has had six meetings with relevant EU officials.</P>
    <P>The indicative allocation for public-private partnerships in the national development plan does not concern measures in the agriculture, food and related rural development areas. My Department has not identified any such potential possibilities.</P>
    <P>As required by EU legislation, a firm of consultants was engaged to undertake an <i>ex-ante</i> evaluation of the CAP rural development plan at a total cost of £19,965. Apart from that, my Department has not engaged consultants to assist with the design or implementation of those aspects of the NDP falling within its responsibility.</P>

    <P>On 1 February 2001, my Department introduced a scheme for investment aid for farm waste management, a scheme for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards and a scheme of housing-handling facilities for alternative enterprises, which were provided for in the National Development Plan, 2000-06. Some £12.3 million has been allocated for these three schemes in the southern and eastern regions during 2001.</P>
    <P>The Leader II programme was administered in Kildare by County Kildare Leader II Company Limited, KELT. All projects had to be committed before 31 December 1999. There were no payments made on capital projects during 2000. Leader II has completed its active phase and until the new programmes have commenced operation, it is not possible to give any details on capital projects in 2001.</P>
    <P>In respect of 2001, a new capital investment scheme for the marketing and processing of certain agricultural projects will be launched in the next few weeks. Applications under this scheme, which is funded under the national development plan, will be subject to an assessment process.</P>

The application by the person named under the 2000 equine headage scheme was received in my Department on 3 January 2001. The person named also applied under the 2000 cattle headage scheme, and the application for that scheme was received in my Department on 25 May 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> As the person named lodged her cattle headage application on time, it appears that the equine headage application was not lodged in time through an oversight, and so <i>force majeure</i> circumstances which, under the terms and conditions of the headage schemes, apply only to the applicant, cannot be accepted on this occasion.</P>

      <P>My Department has an obligation to ensure that all planners and planning agencies who wish to provide a service under REPS 2000 are suitably qualified to do so. To date, my Department has approved some 375 individual planners in 137 planning agencies to provide planning services under the new scheme. The process of examining planners' qualifications, and where necessary seeking additional information on their qualifications, is ongoing and further names will be added to the Department's list of approved planners in due course. The number of plans received by my Department up until 26 February 2001 was 686 and payments have been made in 136 cases.</P>
      <P>REPS payments are calculated to recompense farmers for additional inputs and reduced outputs arising from farming in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner. While REPS is not an income support scheme, therefore, research conducted by Teagasc has shown that farmers who follow REPS specifications are likely to farm more efficiently, and that their average farm incomes show more favourable trends than those of comparable farmers who are not in the scheme.</P>

However, I have suggested that the calf processing scheme which applied in the period 1996-98 and which included all breeds, including friesians, should be re-introduced in order to help reduce beef production in the medium term. The previous scheme applied to calves less than 20 days old and free martins were not eligible on age grounds under that measure.</P>

      <P>Legislation was introduced in the Finance Act, 1998 to provide relief for cross-Border workers, namely, individuals who are resident in the State but who work outside the State. The relief applies to individuals who commute daily or weekly to their place of work outside the State and who pay tax in the other country on the income from their employment. The effect of the relief, which applies from 6 April 1998, is that a resident of the State working in Northern Ireland is taxable on the income from that employment in the United Kingdom only.</P>
      <P>As regards the social and health insurance entitlements, I have been informed by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs that the regulations on social security for migrant workers are directly applicable in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the case of the nationals of all EU countries and the EEA countries &ndash; Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The regulations are designed to protect the entitlements of persons who move between member states. The regulations provide that only the legislation of one member state applies for social security purposes and that the applicable legislation is normally the legislation of the State where the person is employed or self-employed or was last employed or self-employed before the claim was made.</P>
      <P>In the case of a person working in Northern Ireland and residing in the Republic of Ireland, the legislation applicable would be that of Northern Ireland where the social insurance contributions due would be paid. The Northern Ireland authorities would also be the competent authorities for claims for short-term benefits such as sickness and maternity and for invalidity. The person concerned may opt to obtain health services in either Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland. Family benefits would be payable by the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
      <P>Separate pensions for old age, retirement, and widowed persons would be payable by each State, however, provided they have been insured for at least one year. Unemployment benefits would be payable by the State of residence unless the person can prove to have closer ties with the country of last employment.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes is unable to determine whether the taxpayer is due a refund of tax. The inspector understands that the company referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied has ceased trading and it has not been possible to obtain a P45 for the taxpayer. The inspector has written to the taxpayer to try to clarify who the taxpayer's employer was during the period June to December 1999. If the taxpayer can provide further information on that particular issue, the inspector will make every attempt to process his repayment claim.</P>

    <P>The various implementing bodies in each operational programme report physical and financial progress to the managing authority which in turn reports progress and, as appropriate, makes any proposals for reprogramming to the monitoring committee. The monitoring committee is responsible for taking reprogramming decisions in respect of Structural Funds co-financed expenditure. It may only make recommendations in respect of non-co-financed expenditure. There is <Col N="755" /> also a separate monitoring committee for the NDP-CSF with responsibility for taking decisions across programmes. The monitoring committees generally comprise, as full members, representatives of the managing authorities, the implementing bodies, each of the four strands of the social partners, regional assemblies and regional authorities and bodies responsible for the horizontal concerns of equality, the environment, poverty and rural development and, as advisory members, representatives of the European Commission and the NDP-CSF evaluation unit and the NDP-CSF information unit.</P>
    <P>Within the European Commission, there are a number of DGs involved in monitoring the CSF for Ireland, namely DGs Regio, Employ, Agri, Fish, Env and Fin. DG Regio is the lead directorate with responsibility for co-ordinating the Commission's position. Directorate C in DG Regio which also covers Germany, the Scandinavian countries and the United Kingdom is responsible for the CSF for Ireland. The senior official with responsibility for Ireland in Directorate C is Mrs. Elisabeth Slavkoff, director.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department are in ongoing contact both formally and informally with the European Commission, the managing authorities for the operational programmes and Government Departments, the NDP-CSF evaluation unit, the NDP-CSF information unit and the social partners in connection with monitoring implementation of the NDP.</P>
    <P>Since publication of the NDP, officials from the Department of Finance, together with officials of the managing authorities, met representatives from the EU Commission on 18 occasions These meetings were concerned with the negotiation of the community support framework &ndash; seven meetings and the operational programmes &ndash; 11 meetings. In addition, the first meetings of monitoring committees for the NDP-CSF and the technical assistance operational programme which were chaired by my Department were held on 20 October and 29 November 2000, respectively. My officials also attended the first meetings of the OP monitoring committees. Officials from my Department also briefed a plenary meeting of the PPF on progress on implementation of the NDP on 25 January of this year.</P>
    <P>Consultancies related to the NDP for which my Department is directly responsible amount to £850,397.86. These costs relate primarily to two consultancies for the planning and design of a computer system to monitor the NDP and two consultancies on the design of the launch of the NDP and the cover of the NDP. The NDP-CSF information and evaluation units which are co-funded by my Department and the European Union have also engaged in consultancy work in relation to the NDP-CSF to the value of £267,024 to date.</P>
    <P>Primary responsibility for implementation of the NDP within the Department of Finance rests with a subdivision of the finance division headed <Col N="756" /> up by an assistant secretary who is also responsible for general EU policy co-ordination, North-South EU-funded programmes and services provided by the office of the accountant in my Department. The NDP-CSF monitoring committee is chaired by this assistant secretary. Reporting to the assistant secretary on the NDP are two principal officers, six assistant principals, two administrative officers, three higher executive officers and one clerical officer. As NDP expenditure is provided for in the Estimates volume and in the public capital programme officials in the public expenditure division of my Department would also be involved in implementation of the NDP.</P>

    <P>Against the background of the significant reduction in unemployment recorded over the 1996-2000 period, total spending on social welfare increased by almost 23 per cent. At the same time, the Exchequer balance moved from a deficit <Col N="758" /> position to one of healthy surplus. During the Government's period in office, I have introduced four budgets, each of which has contained a social welfare package involving higher spending than the previous one. For instance, Budget 2001 provided for increased social welfare spending of £850 million in a full year, or more than double the Budget 2000 package, which itself was a record.</P>
    <P>Under my budgets the payment rates for pensioners have increased by £28 per week, and by £18 per week for other categories and the payment dates have been advanced to coincide with the start of the tax year, eligibility for the social welfare free schemes has been extended to all those aged 70 years and over, the arrangements and support in relation to carers have been significantly improved, the supports available to families have been increased considerably, including an unprecedented level of increase in child benefit payments which will see an additional £1 billion spent in this area over the next three years. These are some examples of how this Government has committed itself to promoting social inclusion and improving the quality of life of the less well off in society.</P>

      <P>The guidance notes issued by the Money Laundering Steering Committee recommend that the true name of a person wishing to open a bank account or to become a joint signatory on a bank account should be verified by reference to a document obtained from a reputable source which bears a photograph and signature. The guidance notes recommend that wherever possible, a current full valid passport should be requested. It is accepted that there are other documents that customers might produce as evidence of their identity and that it is for each credit institution to decide the appropriateness of such documents in the light of other security procedures operated and other information available at account opening. The guidance notes acknowledge that certain people, particularly the young and the elderly, may not be able to provide appropriate documentary evidence of their identity. In such cases the credit institution may open an account if satisfied with the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, because of difficulties experienced by particular social groups it is hoped to issue revised guidance notes to ensure that measures adopted by institutions should not deny anyone access to financial services on the grounds that <Col N="759" /> they do not possess specified identification documentation, while at the same time ensuring that financial institutions are in a position to comply with their legal obligations.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994 implements the EU Money Laundering Directive in Ireland. Section 32 of the Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that a financial institution &ldquo;shall take reasonable measures to establish the identity of any person for whom it proposes to provide a service.&rdquo; It is the legal responsibility of each financial institution to ensure that it complies with this provision. Failure to comply carries penalties of a fine and/or imprisonment for a term of up to five years.</P>
    <P>The Act does not state what may or may not represent reasonable measures and does not provide for the making of regulations in this regard. Accordingly, in order to facilitate consistent implementation of the anti-money laundering provisions of the Act, guidance notes were issued in April 1995 by the Money Laundering Steering Committee, established under my Department and representing various sectors of the financial services industry and the relevant regulatory authorities.</P>
    <P>These recommend that a customer's identity be verified by reference to a document obtained from a reputable source which bears a photograph and signature. The guidance notes state that it may be reasonable to depart from such specific verification procedures in certain circumstances where a person may not be able to provide such documentary evidence. An institution's management can determine the type of alternative evidence that it is prepared to accept in such cases in order to ensure that the institution complies with its legal obligations under the Act.</P>
    <P>The 1995 guidance notes are under review. The issue of customer identification procedures, including the issue of setting out more specific guidance on alternative methods of identification in cases where persons are not in a position to produce a passport-driving licence, is being considered. The objective is to ensure that measures adopted by institutions should not deny a person access to financial services on the grounds that they do not possess specified identification documentation, while at the same time ensuring that financial institutions are in a position to comply with their legal obligations under the Act. It is expected that this review will conclude shortly and revised guidance notes be issued.</P>

      <P>The Irish Red Cross Society, who undertook the administration of the Government's humanitarian aid scheme for the victims of the flooding last November, have disbursed £2.75 million provided by the Government to some 400 applicants in 17 countries. The following is the breakdown of the number of payments on a county by county basis: County Cork 37, County Carlow 19, County Cavan 2, County Dublin 26, County Galway 1, County Kildare 9, County Kilkenny 17, County Kerry 3, County Louth 1, County Limerick 2, County Leitrim 3, County Meath 22, County Offaly 1, County Tipperary 126, County Waterford 6, County Wicklow 47, County Wexford 78.

      <P>I do not have a breakdown of the amounts paid out on a county by county basis, as it is customary in the administration of such aid schemes that the preparation of this information will form part of the Irish Red Cross Society's detailed report on the humanitarian aid scheme once the scheme has been finalised and all expenditure accounted for. The humanitarian aid scheme was administered on a strictly confidential basis between the society and individual applicants. It is not intended to publish the breakdown of the disbursements on a smaller geographical area than county as that could lead to identification of individual applicants.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, due to the work load associated with the Finance Bill, it will not be possible to meet the stated organisation to discuss its concerns on the Government's response to the recommendations of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector. This issue is, in the first instance, a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Any concerns about the Government's response to the recommendations of the commission should be addressed to that Department. On 5 January the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, announced the Government proposals for reforms in the private rented residential sector arising from the commission's report.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill, 2001 as published, provides for certain tax incentives included in these measures as follows &ndash; roll over relief for capital gains tax purposes will be made available to landlords where the proceeds of a sale of investment property providing rented residential accommodation are reinvested in such property. It will be a condition that the reinvestment property must contain at least as many residential units as the one disposed of, with a minimum of three units to apply in any event. The disallowance of interest payments for tax purposes in respect of properties purchased on or after 5 January 2001 will be removed where all the following criteria are met &ndash; the property had been converted from a single unit into multiple units of three or more prior to 1 October 1963, that is, when the 1963 planning legislation came into force, the property consists of at least three units and the total number of units is not reduced below 50% of the number of units at the time of acquisition, at least 50% of the units in the property are available for letting to tenants in receipt of SWA assistance or any revised rent assistance arrangements which are put in place. The tax relief will apply to the tax liability on the rental income only.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to all of the reliefs outlined will be dependent on compliance with the applicable regulatory controls and to registering tenancies with the proposed private residential tenancies board. Further measures are under consideration for inclusion on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill. I will let the Deputy have the details when they are announced.</P>

This was in response to the recommendations of the forthcoming report of the working group on foster care. In line with the report's recommendations, foster care allowances will be increased as follows &ndash; for children under 12, the allowance will increase from £71.55 to £200 per week and for children of 12 years and over, the allowance will increase from £85.75 to £220 per week.</P>

The working group proposed that the cost of medical services not covered by medical card, and educational fees should continue to be met by the health boards. The details of the revised payment level will be finalised soon and a circular issued to all health boards. The new rates will be paid with effect from the end of July 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209, 210, 211, 218, 220, 230, 241 and 249 together.</P>
      <P>The disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme, which comes under the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, enables qualifying persons to purchase a new car every two years free of vehicle registration tax, VRT, and VAT to a maximum of £7,500 if the qualifying person is the driver, and £12,500 if the passenger. It provides for the refund of excise on up to 600 gallons of fuel and exemption from annual road tax. The scheme cost some £22 million in 2000, excluding the annual road tax costs.</P>
      <P>The mobility allowance, which is a monthly payment administered by the health boards, provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport. It is to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings &ndash; for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. The rate of the allowance is being doubled to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April next. From then persons who benefit from the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme will be unable to avail of the mobility allowance. The beneficiaries of the tax-based scheme have access to transport which is heavily subsidised by the State. The new arrangement is targeted at incapacitated people who do not enjoy these advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> In consultation with the Minister for Finance, I considered this proposal in the light of concerns expressed and representations received about the impact of complete cessation of the mobility allowance on some affected individuals. I decided that while the increased rate of £90 per month will be given only to people who are not also enjoying tax subsidies, those benefiting from both schemes should retain the existing mobility allowance of £45 per month.</P>
    <P>Regarding the utilisation of these schemes, the Revenue Commissioners administer the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme, which allows for the purchase every two years of a new car free of VRT and VAT, subject to certain limits. The number who availed of VRT and VAT concession over each of the past two years is as follows:</P>

    <P>Based on the numbers who claim relief from excise duty on fuel on an ongoing basis, it is estimated that the total number of beneficiaries under the scheme is in the region of 7,000. At end-December 2000, the mobility allowance administered by the health boards was being paid to 2,937 people. As it was never intended that individuals should benefit from both schemes, the data from the various agencies has not been integrated. Information regarding the overlap between the two schemes is not available.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are met. Applicants must also undergo a means test to decide eligibility.</P>
    <P>The mobility allowance, among others, is being considered in the context of the following interdepartmental working groups: the Review Group Examining the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme, chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the working group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which is examining the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment, chaired by my Department.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received a report from the Cork and Kerry diabetes and heart disease study carried out at University College Cork in collaboration with the Southern Health Board in Cork University Hospital which shows that almost half the population in Cork and Kerry are overweight; and the steps he proposes to take to deal with this problem.</Quest>

      <P>I have received the Cork and Kerry diabetes and heart disease study which found that 4% of those studied had diabetes, of whom 30% had not previously been diagnosed. The prevalence of diabetes is rising in the developed world and presents a major public health challenge, both in terms of prevention and in the provision of high quality care for patients so as to reduce the rate at which they develop complications.</P>
      <P>The data suggest that three quarters of this population group rather than the population of Cork and Kerry are overweight, of whom one quarter is obese. This is higher than has been reported in other studies in that region, for example, the happy heart survey of the early 1990s. The population is getting heavier in the developed world. This is associated with increased prevalence of diabetes in older age groups, as well as with other health problems, including raised blood pressure.</P>
      <P>Maintaining the correct body weight or losing weight can be achieved through healthy eating and physical activity. The national healthy eating campaign, run by the Department of Health and Children, has over the past eight years raised awareness of healthy eating and provided practical information to the general public.

      <P>Patients with diabetes have a two to four fold risk of coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease compared to people who have not. Heart related disease is our biggest cause of death. These high rates of illness and premature death are unacceptable from a disease which is preventable. Part of the cardiovascular health strategy in October 2000 is a mass media campaign called Ireland needs a change of heart. It uses television, radio and outdoor advertising. A handy guide to a healthy heart &ndash; a 16 page handbook providing advice on lifestyle changes each individual can make to help improve their heart health was delivered to every home last year.</P>

    <P>The Cork and Kerry diabetes and heart disease study found that 40% of 50 to 69 year olds engaged in minimal physical activity. The SLAN survey &ndash; survey of lifestyle, attitudes and nutrition &ndash; shows that physical activity decreases with age. The next phase of Ireland Needs a Change of Heart, this year, will focus on encouraging the population, older people in particular, <Col N="767" /> to increase awareness of the benefits of physical activity and to encourage them to increase their levels of physical activity.</P>

      <P>Morphine is a schedule two controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984. Drugs in this schedule are regarded as particularly dangerous if misused. Morphine is subject to strict controls in relation to its manufacture, importation, supply, prescription and possession.

    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> Arrangements for monitoring of medical prescriptions generally include inspections by inspectors of the pharmaceutical society of Ireland and information made available to health boards via the General Medical Services (Payments) Board. Where concerns arise in relation to controlled drugs referral may be made to the medical council or to my Department depending on the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>The Acts allow for the setting up of a committee of inquiry where appropriate to investigate any suspected case of irresponsible prescribing of controlled drugs. The Acts also provide for the issuing of a special direction which would prohibit a medical practitioner from prescribing specified controlled drugs where such a practitioner is found to be irresponsibly prescribing. In addition, in accordance with the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, the Medical Council can investigate complaints of misconduct by medical practitioners and, where a <i>prima facie</i> case is found, a fitness to practice enquiry can be established.</P>
    <P>My Department's chief medical officer has communicated a number of times in the past few years with general practitioners concerning the need to exercise caution when prescribing controlled drugs and my Department will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that such prescribing continues to be done in a reasonable fashion.</P>

      <P>The Mental Health Bill, 1999, currently before the Oireachtas, provides for the involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment. It provides for different legal procedures to be followed with regard to the detention of adults and of children under 18.

      <P>Children aged 16 to 18 are currently treated by the adult psychiatric services. However, the placement of children of this age in adult psychiatric facilities is increasingly seen as inappropriate. A working group has been established by my Department to review child and adolescent psychiatry and to finalise a plan for its future development. This group will also examine the service needs of persons between 16 and 18 years, in conjunction with experts from the field of adult psychiatry, to determine how these can best be addressed in the context of future service developments.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Irish Medicines Board that there is no thiomersal in any of the vaccines used in the primary vaccination scheme. The use of thiomersal in vaccines has been considered on a number of occasions by the scientific committee of the European medicines evaluation agency in which the Irish Medicines Board participates. In July 1999 the committee recommended that all medicinal products containing thiomersal be required to state in the patient information leaflet that &ldquo;This medicinal product contains Thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you/your child may experience an allergic reaction&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tell your doctor if you/your child has any known allergies&rdquo;. Companies were required by the Irish Medicines Board to implement this statement by the end of June 2000.</P>
      <P>In addition, the biotechnology working party of the committee for proprietary medicinal products has recently &ndash; 16 November 2000 CPMP/BWP/2517 &ndash; issued a consultation document entitled Points to consider the reduction, elimination or substitution of thiomersal in vaccines. This document has been released for consultation with a deadline for comments of February 2001 and encourages authorisation holders to reduce, eliminate or substitute thiomersal. It is recognised that this is a complex task which may require additional clinical studies before it can be implemented. I am awaiting the outcome of these consultations.</P>

      <P>As part of the orthodontic initiative recently announced, the Department approved a proposal from the Eastern Regional Health Authority for a grant in-aid scheme. Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment will be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of income tax relief on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders.</P>
      <P>The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months. A working group on the implementation of the scheme within the board is being established. The target date for the implementation of the pilot scheme is 1 April this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236 to 239, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department has overall responsibility for the implementation of the national development plan &ndash; NDP &ndash; for the health services. The prioritisation, planning and delivery of health capital projects under the NDP at local level is the responsibility of each health board. In the context of the NDP, my Department reports to the Department of the Environment and Local Government under the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme &ndash; ESIOP. In the circumstances, my Department does not therefore have direct contact with the EU Commission or any of its officials in relation to the NDP.</P>
      <P>One consultant has been engaged by my Department on a short-term basis to advise on the development of an appropriate monitoring-reporting system to assist in the implementation of the NDP. The consultancy fee involved in this case is in the region of £10,000. A sum of £2 billion was made available to the health service at the launch of the NDP. This was apportioned by my Department to health boards on an indicative funding basis for each year of the NDP, in line with the regional and other criteria governing the overall objectives of the plan. Health boards prepared capital development plans based on the indicative funding indicated to them over the lifetime of the NDP. To facilitate the earliest possible commencement procurement processes, the health board plans were prepared in greater detail for the initial years of the NDP and a broad brush approach was taken in regard to subsequent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, the health board plans are evolving in nature and are expected to change over the period of the NDP in view of evolving service, financial, and operational circumstances. In view of the fact that health boards have primary responsibility for the prioritisation, planning and delivery of capital developments at local level, it would not be practical for me to detail individual projects and costs as these will be subject to continuous change under the indicative NDP funding <Col N="776" /> notified to each health board for specific health care programmes.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that all the capital projects for my Department are encompassed by NDP funding, the hospital planning office &ndash; HPO &ndash; of my Department has central responsibility for progressing the NDP. The HPO consists of approximately 25 staff, of varying professional and administrative grades. In addition, staff of various grades in most of the other divisions of my Department have responsibilities in relation to progressing the plan for their particular service areas.</P>
    <P>My Department is in regular contact with a number of groups in relation to the implementation of the NDP. These include the Department of Finance, Department of the Environment and Local Government, the health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, and various professional or voluntary agencies as required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In total 197 children have been adopted from Russia since 1991: one in 1993, one in 1996, four in 1997, 53 in 1998, 74 in 1999 and 64 in 2000. The figure for 2000 is provisional.</P>
      <P>In May 2000, just prior to my pre-arranged visit to Moscow, three new decrees were introduced by the Russian authorities under the federal law No. 94 of June 1998. The resolutions provided for the establishment of an interdepartmental commission to oversee and regulate adoption procedures in the Russian Federation, including adoptions by foreign citizens &ndash; resolution 267; the accreditation of foreign adoption agencies operating on the territory of the Russian Federation &ndash; resolution 268; and procedures by which a Russian, or foreign citizen, can adopt a Russian child &ndash; resolution 275. The coming into force of these regulations meant that foreign agencies currently operating in Russia must be accredited by the Russian authorities. In addition, resolution 275 provided that applicants may only be represented by agencies accredited in their own country for five years or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my timely visit to Russia, I had the opportunity to explore the implications of the new resolutions with the relevant ministries. I specifically raised the issue of the situation of pro<Col N="778" /> spective adopters in Ireland. I outlined the situation with regard to the absence of such agencies in Ireland and the absence of legislation to provide for a system of accreditation envisaged in the Russian resolutions. The intention of my visit had been to develop a bilateral working arrangement with the Russian Federation along the lines agreed with a number of other states, but the Russian Government did not see a need for a bilateral agreement between our two countries as they intended signing the Hague Convention which they have since done. At that time, I was assured that Irish couples could continue to adopt independently by approaching the relevant Russian authorities directly.</P>
    <P>On my return I made several statements outlining the situation to prospective adopters and I know that the Adoption Board have also been active in informing prospective adopters regarding the issue. I have continued to monitor the situation and I understand adoptions of Russian children by Irish couples continue to proceed. In the meantime I have been examining the legislation governing the accreditation of agencies to provide mediation services outside the State and I am actively pursuing this matter with the Adoption Board. I am hopeful that this matter can be clarified very soon. I am progressing with the representative of the Russian Government arrangements for future co-operation in the context of their legislation.</P>

      <P>The price of drugs and medicines in Ireland has been subject to control since 1972 through the mechanism of formal multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association &ndash; IPHA &ndash; formerly the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries &ndash; FICI. The maximum price to the wholesaler of any new item of medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreement shall not, on the date of notification, exceed the currency adjusted UK wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is the lower. Accordingly, Irish prices for the ingredient cost of prescription medicines are generally in line with prices in the UK. A price freeze is also in place in regard to the prices charged for existing products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manufacturers of the product referred to by the Deputy notified my Department of their intention to introduce a 28 pack size. Bulk packs of the product &ndash; 100 pack and 1,000 pack sizes &ndash; are no longer available on the Irish market. The product concerned is imported from the UK <Col N="779" /> and the change in pack size is in line with the UK patient pack initiative and the pricing is in line with the currency converted UK price. In view of the demand for and importance of this product, my Department deemed it appropriate to accept the revised arrangements.</P>

      <P>Health boards are required to provide general practitioner services to all medical card patients and such services are provided by doctors holding GMS scheme contracts. The contract sets out both the conditions under which services are to be provided to medical card holders and the relationship between the board and the contracted doctor in terms of accepting and assigning patients.</P>
      <P>The contract provides that in a situation where a general practitioner does not wish to accept a particular patient, he or she can be requested by the board to provide, confidentially, the reasons for his or her unwillingness. Ultimately, however, under the contract, the board has the power to assign patients to ensure their medical needs are met. This power of assignment may only be used in the case of a person who has applied unsuccessfully to all those medical practitioners or to at least three of them, whichever is the lesser, who are contracted GMS scheme doctors in the area concerned. Where assignment takes place, there is provision for such assignment to be reviewed at the doctor's request after a six months' period. I am satisfied that the above contractual rules are adequate to ensure appropriate provision of general practitioner services to all medical card patients.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of the EU Directive on the Mutual Recognition of Qualifications, the Minister for Health and Children functions as the designated authority for validating non-national qualifications for employment as an occupational therapist in this country.</P>
      <P>Citizens of an EU country, with an EU qualification, wishing to work in Ireland must apply to the Minister in order to have their qualifications recognised. Assessment of such foreign occupational therapy qualifications are carried out by the designated competent authority, school of occupational therapy in Trinity College, and the advisory body, the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland. The EU directive lays down a maximum timeframe for this validation process of four months from receipt of a completed application. However, if the application is not complete and it is necessary to request additional information from the applicant, the four month timeframe restarts on receipt of the additional information necessary to complete the application.</P>
      <P>In the two cases referred to by the Deputy the four month deadline has not expired. The application in respect of the first named person was received in the Department during the last week of January 2001, forwarded to the relevant bodies on 5 February 2001 and it is currently being processed. It is expected the Department would be informed of the decisions of the relevant bodies on the application in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The application of the second named person was received in the Department and forwarded to the relevant bodies during November 2000. Additional information was requested by the school of occupational therapy, Trinity College on 29 November 2000 and from the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland on 12 January 2001. The applicant and her prospective employer, who sent in the application and communicated with the Department on the applicant's behalf, were informed of the additional information required to complete the application. Some of the additional information requested has yet to be received and the application cannot proceed until it is received.</P>

Proposals in the report are being progressively implemented. Amendments to the 1985 guidelines are being finalised with the chief executive officers of the health boards and the review group on orthodontic services.</P>

Out of this £4 million, the Western Health Board received £750,000.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Western Health Board that to date, £95,508 has been paid to 101 people. I understand that a further £381,469 remains to be paid in respect of 4,385 subvention recipients. The board has assured me that immediate arrangements are being made to issue payments to discharged patients and to the next-of-kin or estates of deceased residents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a range of specifically targeted options available to assist elderly people to carry out necessary improvement works to their houses. The schemes operated by local authorities include the essential repairs grant scheme, the disabled person's grant scheme, the improvement works <i>in lieu </i>of local authority housing scheme and the local authority house improvement loan scheme. I consider it appropriate that Galway County Council and Galway Corporation should each administer these schemes within their own functional areas.</P>
      <P>Under the task force on the special housing aid for the elderly scheme, which is operated by the health boards, necessary basic repairs and improvements are carried out to the houses of elderly persons. In the interests of elderly persons, it has been administered since its inception with a minimum of formality and it has been an objective to avoid formal procedural and other requirements. In appropriate circumstances, works are carried out at no cost to the applicant. Health boards value the scheme as part of their framework of support for the elderly. The extensive local knowledge acquired by health boards from long experience in operating the scheme and through the many health board employees in regular contact with the elderly is a valuable contribution to the administration of the scheme and I would be unwilling to lose such an asset.</P>
      <P>Each of the range of schemes make an important contribution to improving the living conditions of elderly persons wishing to remain in their own homes and the knowledge and experience of both local authorities and health boards are valuable in the implementation of the different schemes. I would, therefore, be reluctant to dispense with either approach and limit the range of options available to the elderly. Local authorities and health boards are encouraged to liase at local level to avoid duplication of applications and administration and to ensure that the needs of the elderly are met in the most appropriate way.</P>

      <P>I increased the effective maximum grant available under the essential repairs grant scheme from £1,800 in 1998 to the current level of £7,500. Activity under the scheme, which is administered by local authorities, increased significantly last year. In the full year 1999, 966 grants were paid by local authorities. In the nine months to end September 2000, which is the latest data available, 965 grants had been paid, which is almost a 50% increase on the number of grants paid in the same period in 1999.</P>
      <P>Although the 99 improvement works in lieu of local authority housing projects completed by September 2000, is marginally down on the 112 completions to end September 1999, activity by local authorities under the scheme is increasing, as evidenced by a 30% increase in the number of improvement works in progress and commenced in September 2000 over September 1999 and a 20% increase in works approved but not yet commenced.</P>
      <P>I continually encourage local authorities to utilise to the full the range of schemes available to them to meet housing need in their areas and I am satisfied that activity in relation to these schemes greatly increased during 2000 as compared to 1999.</P>

    <P>Last year I asked the national rural water monitoring committee to furnish proposals for meeting the waste water collection and treatment needs of small rural communities.

Subject to a satisfactory outcome to the pilot testing, the report envisages a potential role for group sewerage schemes in the collection of domestic waste water from households outside the immediate catchment of new treatment systems. Consequently, any such developments in relation to group sewerage schemes and any review of the associated grants must await the results of the pilot study.</P>

      <P>There is no provision in the rental subsidy scheme for the purchase of individual houses by tenants. A tenant purchase scheme for rental subsidy houses is not desirable at this stage of the development of the voluntary housing sector in this country as the sale of individual housing units would undermine the capacity and resources of voluntary housing bodies to manage and maintain their estates and continue to provide further housing projects to meet pressing needs.</P>
      <P>Residents of rental subsidy houses of more than one year's duration who wish to become owner occupiers, on surrendering their house to the approved body, may qualify for the following benefits: a special mortgage allowance of £9,000 over five years to assist with mortgage repayments; the shared ownership scheme without having to satisfy the income eligibility criteria; improvement works in lieu scheme in respect of the dwelling they are acquiring; low cost housing sites scheme; and exemption from the income limit for local authority housing loans.

      <P>The question of which packaging materials and packaging systems are environmentally preferable is complex, and a definitive assessment of the best practicable environmental option in any particular circumstance would require appropriate life cycle analysis.</P>
      <P>Article 18 of EU Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste prohibits member states from impeding the placing on the market of packaging that satisfies the provisions of the directive, which is in accordance with the essential requirements specified in annex II of the directive as to the composition and the reusable and recoverable nature of packaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the provision by a member state of subvention in respect of the production of any particular product or packaging, to the detriment <Col N="793" /><Col N="794" /> of others, would appear to be contrary to the rules of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, while the Government has agreed that the proceeds from the proposed levy on plastic shopping bags will accrue to a dedicated central fund for use in support of waste minimisation, recycling and other desirable litter, waste management and environmental initiatives generally, I have no proposals to use levy revenues to directly subsidise specific types of packaging.</P>

      <Quest>the amount given to each local authority in Counties Leitrim, Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Galway and Sligo Corporation for the provision of sewerage schemes for the years 1995 to 2000; and the percentage increase or decrease in each local authority for each year.</Quest>

      <P>Funding for major sewerage schemes is provided for local authorities on a project rather than a programme basis. Expenditure incurred by local authorities on individual approved schemes is recouped by my Department in response to payment claims submitted by authorities. Recoupments made to the local authorities concerned under these arrangements are set out in table 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of expenditure on small schemes under the rural water programme are set out in table 2. Responsibility for the administration of the rural water programme was devolved to local authorities in 1997 when new funding arrangements, involving 75% block grants from my Department, were introduced. Under the devolved arrangements selection of individual schemes for construction under the rural water programme is now a matter for the authorities themselves. Accord<Col N="795" /> ingly, the figures provided in the table for 1997 <Col N="796" /> to date do not differentiate between water and sewerage schemes.</P>

      <P>An initial assessment report from Kilkenny County Council in relation to flood damage generally sustained in late 2000 was received in my Department on 10 November 2000.</P>
      <P>I recently announced non-national road grant allocations for 2001 to local authorities of £319 million. Kilkenny County Council's allocation for 2001 is £7.232 million, which is a 15% increase on the 2000 allocation and a 67% increase on 1997.</P>
      <P>In principle, the considerable funds available to local authorities for non-national roads maintenance and improvement, combined with their own resources, are designed to cover contingencies arising from flooding, storm damage and other weather related works. My Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads advises that the cost of remedial works necessitated by such conditions should be met from these resources and that local authorities should set aside contingency sums to finance such works.</P>
      <P>My Department is prepared to consider sympathetically any request from a local authority to adjust its multi-annual restoration programme so as to prioritise works necessitated by flood damage to particular roads.</P>

These programmes are managed by the regional assemblies with which my Department is in regular contact.</P>
    <P>The infrastructure operational programme and monitoring unit of the roads division co-ordinates my Department's function as managing authority for the economic and social infrastructure operational programme. The unit has a staff complement of seven &ndash; one principal officer, two assistant principal officers, one higher executive officer, one administrative officer, one executive officer and one clerical officer.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to indicate the precise number of projects that will be undertaken as part of programmes coming within the remit of my Department. The projects to be undertaken will be selected and progressed over the seven year period of the plan on a phased basis by my Department, the NRA and local authorities. However, my Department last year published multi-annual plans covering the water and waste water and housing priorities, indicating the projects to be progressed over the early years of the national development plan. The National Roads Authority recently published a review and outlook document that provides details of the national road improvement projects to be undertaken. Progress on the implementation of all projects, which is being closely monitored, is generally proceeding according to schedule.</P>
    <P>My Department, as managing authority for the economic and social infrastructure operational programme, reports to a monitoring committee for the programme that is representative of Government Departments, implementing agencies, regional assemblies, regional authorities, the social partners and the European Commission, as well as bodies representing environmental, equality, and rural development issues. Within the framework of the operational programme monitoring committee, and otherwise as part of its responsibilities for infrastructure investment programmes, my Department is in regular contact with implementing agencies, including local authorities, the NRA and the Dublin Transportation Office and with a wide range of Government Departments, statutory bodies, social partners and other organisations. My Department has not employed consultants to assist with the design or implementation of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The Regional Policy Directorate has responsibility within the European Commission for Ireland's Community Support Framework. Ms E. Slavkoff is head of the unit dealing with Ireland. <Col N="799" /> Officials of my Department have met officials from the Regional Policy Directorate of the European Commission on seven occasions since the publication of the national development plan in relation to negotiations on the Community Support Framework, 2000-06, and the economic and social infrastructure operational programme.</P>

      <P>The national development plan set a target of IR£1.55 billion &ndash; 1.97 billion &ndash; of private finance to be invested in PPP projects for sectors within the remit of my Department. The three sectors involved are the roads, water and waste sectors. Within these sectors, a total of five PPP contracts have been signed, a further 29 PPP projects have been approved and a further 85 have been identified at this stage as having PPP potential. The following table shows the location, name and capital costs of all those projects and is set out by current stage and sector.</P>
      <P>Table 1: PPP projects: This table includes all PPP projects where there is a capital value in excess of £1 million private finance investment or long-term operational period &ndash; in excess of five years &ndash; with significant transfer of risk to the private sector. The table does not include design and build projects or basic outsourcing contracts. Figures shown represent the capital cost of the construction element of the project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is no grants scheme specifically directed at assisting elderly persons to install heating in their own homes, there are a number of options available to assist lower income households and elderly persons in particular to secure necessary improvement works to their houses. These include the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the disabled person's and essential repairs grants scheme, the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme and the task force on special housing aid for the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the task force, which is operated by the health boards, necessary basic repairs and improvements are carried out to the houses of elderly persons. In the interests of elderly persons, it has, since its inception, been administered with a minimum of formality and it has been an objective to avoid formal procedural and other requirements. Works are, in appropriate circumstances, carried out at no cost to the applicant. Last year I extended the terms of the scheme to <Col N="806" /> include, where appropriate, the provision of heating systems.</P>
    <P>I also introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the disabled person's and essential repairs grants scheme since coming into office. The effective maximum grant available under the disabled person's grants scheme has increased from £8,000 to £16,000 with the grant covering up to 90% of the approved cost of the works compared to two thirds previously. In addition, I increased the maximum grant available under the essential repairs grants scheme from £1,800 to £7,500. I also allocated record funding of £8.658 million to the task force on special housing aid for the elderly in 2001. These improvements have allowed local authorities and health boards to extend the type of work that can be undertaken in individual cases, particularly in regard to the provision of heating systems.</P>
    <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their existing dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own resources. However, where capital funding is provided under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major essential works to designated estates, the installation of central heating in dwellings may form part of the works undertaken.</P>

      <P>The administration of the essential repairs grants scheme is a matter for each local authority. My Department's role relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of grants. Certain information on activity under the essential repairs grants scheme is published in my Department's annual housing bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The Deputy should note that the information published relates to activity at county level and includes the urban district councils, which do not appear separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information in relation to 2000 is being compiled and is due for publication at the end of March. Information in relation to activity by the urban district councils concerned has been sought <Col N="807" /> and will be sent to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>

      <P>Under electoral law a presiding officer may of his or her own volition, or if so required by a personation agent, request any person applying for a ballot paper to satisfy him or her as to their identity by producing any one of a number of specified documents. Where a person fails to produce such a document or the presiding officer is not satisfied that the person is the person to whom the document relates, a ballot paper is not issued. Presiding officers have powers to direct a member of the Garda Síochána to arrest a person where they have reasonable cause to believe that personation is or has been committed and electoral law also provides for the offence of personation and appropriate penalties. I am satisfied that these arrangements are operating satisfactorily, but it is a matter I will keep under review.</P>

      <P>At £850 million, the social welfare budget for 2001 is the biggest ever and more than double last year's welfare package. This allocation will, to an unprecedented extent, direct the resources of the State at the needs of our disadvantaged citizens and communities.</P>
      <P>Among the most significant of these improvements are £25 and £30 increases in monthly child benefit for the lower and higher rates respectively, with increases to be paid three months earlier from June next; £10 a week increase for single old age pensioners; up to £25 a week increase for pensioner couples &ndash; 66 years and over; £12.90 per week special increase for contributory widows and widowers over 66 years; and £8 general increase in the weekly social welfare rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full year cost in implementing the increases in the weekly rates of social welfare payments is almost £442 million and these increases will benefit 865,000 recipients and a further 124,000 qualified adults. The consequen<Col N="809" /> tial increases in family income supplement will cost £13 million in a full year and will benefit some 17,500 families. The increases in monthly child benefit are set to benefit 532,000 families-1,043,000 children-at a cost of £329 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The social welfare budget package also includes a further range of improvements in the social welfare code costing £66 million in a full year. These improvements will benefit pensioners, widow, widowers, carers, people with disabilities, families and voluntary and community organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisional expenditure under the SWA scheme for 2000 was £255.9 million. The breakdown of this expenditure was £69.3 million on basic payments, £118.6 million on rent supplements, £4.6 million on mortgage interest supplements, £6.6 million on other supplements, including diet, travel and heating, £24.3 <Col N="810" /> million on exceptional needs payments, ENPs, £10.7 million on back to school clothing and footwear, BSCF, and £21.8 million on administration.</P>
      <P>Expenditure under the SWA scheme for the years 1995 to 1999 is set out in the following tabular statement. Total expenditure rose by £121.7 million or 91% in the five years between 1995 and 2000. Over half the increase, £63.9 million, was accounted for by rent supplement, where spending increased by 117% during the five years in question, mainly due to increases in rent levels. The Government has decided in principle to set up a new scheme of rent assistance which will be operated by the local authorities. Arising from this, more appropriate housing solutions will be offered to people with long-term housing needs and there will be less recourse to SWA rent supplement.</P>
      <P>In addition, the SWA scheme is being reviewed as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed primarily at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. All aspects of the scheme will be examined and opportunities for making these expenditures more productive will be carefully considered. The review also provides an opportunity to re-focus the scheme, and the health boards' community welfare service of which it is part, to become more effective in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>

      <Quest>the length of time a person from another EU country who emigrates to Ireland must be in residence before they become entitled to social welfare benefits, such as unemployment benefits and assistance, old age pensions and disability pensions.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations on social security for migrant workers are directly applicable in all EU countries and in those in the European Economic Area &ndash; Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The regulations are designed to protect the social security entitlements of persons who move to other member states. They apply to EU and EEA nationals only. The regulations provide that only the legislation of one member state applies for social security purposes and that the applicable legislation is normally the legislation of the country where the person is employed or self-employed or was last employed or self-employed before the claim was made.</P>
      <P>Once a person emigrating here takes up employment or self-employment in Ireland, he becomes subject to Irish legislation for social insurance purposes and is eligible for benefits in the same way as other persons similarly insured. His periods of insurance completed in other member states can be added, if required, to whatever periods of insurance he has completed in Ireland to qualify for benefits. If the combined insurance is sufficient to satisfy the contribution conditions under Irish legislation, the person concerned could be covered against the various short-term contingencies such as sickness, maternity and unemployment almost as soon as employment is taken up.</P>
      <P>The country of claim, Ireland in this case, would pay the full amount due at its rates of payment. This also applies in the case of invalidity pensions where the previous periods of insurance had been completed in certain States, including the UK. In the case of pensions for old age and retirement and, in certain cases, invalidity, each country where the person has completed periods of insurance of at least one year normally pays a <i>pro rata</i> pension which is in proportion to the periods of insurance actually completed under its legislation, If, however, there is a higher amount due under a country's legislation alone, this higher pension amount is payable instead of the <i>pro rata</i> pension. Pensions due are paid in accordance with the rules for the commencement of such pension payments in each country concerned. There are no periods of residence conditions for entitlement to social assistance payments in Ireland. Accordingly, a person who is properly resident here is eligible for these payments on the same basis as other residents subject to satisfying the standard eligibility conditions.</P>

      <P>Regulations on social security for migrant workers are directly applicable in all EU countries and in those in the European Economic Area - Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The regulations are designed to protect the social security entitlements of persons who move to other member states. They apply to EU and EEA nationals only and do not apply to occupational and personal pension schemes.</P>
      <P>If a person to whom the regulations apply takes up employment or self-employment after moving here, he is entitled to have the periods of insurance completed in the other country added to any periods of insurance completed in Ireland to qualify for benefits under legislation, as if these periods completed abroad had been completed in Ireland. Benefits for short-term contingencies such as sickness, maternity and unemployment would normally be paid under Irish legislation and at the Irish rates of payment. This also applies in the case of invalidity pensions where the periods of insurance had been completed in certain EU states, including the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>In the case of pensions for old age, retirement, widowed persons and, in certain cases, invalidity, a pension amount is paid by each country where the person had completed periods of insurance of at least one year. The pension amounts are usually in proportion to the periods of insurance actually completed in each country and are normally referred to as <i>pro rata</i> pensions. Thus, if in a career of 40 years, a person had completed 20 years insurance in each of two countries, he would qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension approximately equivalent to half a full pension from each country. However, if he had enough insurance to qualify for a pension in his own right under the legislation of a country, then this pension amount and the <i>pro rata</i> pension amount would be compared and the higher of the two would become payable.</P>
      <P>An EU national from another EU country entitled to reside here would also be eligible for other benefits due to residents, such as child benefit, even if the child was living in another member state, benefits under social assistance and health services, provided he satisfies the conditions for entitlement which apply to other residents. If he was already receiving a pension from another member state or became entitled to one while resident here, the pension would be payable to him in Ireland in the currency of the state making the payment. Special rules apply in certain cases to frontier workers such as a person working in Northern Ireland and residing in the Republic of Ireland. For example, if he became unemployed, the benefit due would be paid by the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nationals of countries to which the regulations do not apply must rely on the provisions of national legislation alone for benefit entitlements if they move to other countries, unless they are from a country with which Ireland has a reciprocal agreement. These include Australia, Austria, <Col N="813" /> Canada, Quebec, New Zealand, UK and the USA. These apply mainly to pensions and, in the case of Austria and the UK, only apply where the EU regulations are not applicable. Persons not covered by the EU regulations and the reciprocal agreements, but who are entitled to be resident and employed or self-employed in Ireland, would be eligible to become insured under Irish legislation, but no account could be taken of periods of insurance completed abroad to assist them qualify for benefits or pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 309 to 313, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has responsibility for a number of social inclusion measures in the national development plan. These measures come under two programmes-the employment and human resources development operational programme and the community development and family support measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information sought in Questions Nos. 309, 310 and 313 is not relevant to these aspects of the national development plan and the queries raised by the Deputy in these questions are not applicable to the way in which the Department of <Col N="815" /> Social, Community and Family Affairs is meeting its commitments under the plan.</P>
    <P>In relation to Questions Nos. 311 and 312, the information requested by the Deputy is as follows. Under the employment and human resources operational programme, the Department has responsibility for the ongoing development and implementation of the back-to-work allowance scheme and the back to education scheme, which constitute the two pillars of the employment support service of the Department.</P>
    <P>In the national development plan, £950 million is provided for the duration of the plan for expenditure on the back-to-work allowance scheme and the back-to-education scheme, £665 million in the southern and eastern region and £285 million in the Border, midlands and western region. These schemes are being implemented on an ongoing basis and have been operational for a number of years. Some 38,000 people are being helped by the back to work scheme and some 5,500 people are being helped by the back to education scheme. One principal officer &ndash; higher level &ndash; and one assistant principal officer are working part time on the national development plan aspects of both these schemes.</P>
    <P>Under the community development and family support measure, funding of some £110 million over the period of the plan has been made available to support the community development support programme, through funds made available from the national lottery. Funding of some £17 million has been allocated to these programmes in 2001. Community development is about promoting positive change in society in favour of those who usually benefit least and seeks to challenge the causes of disadvantage-poverty and to offer new opportunities to those lacking choice, power and resources. The community development support programme includes the community development programme, the family and community services resource centre programme and the programme of core funding to locally based community and family support groups.</P>
    <P>Under the community development programme some 130 projects-areas countrywide are in receipt of funding or have been approved for inclusion in the programme. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness commits the Department to continuing the expansion of this programme to other disadvantaged areas. Some 70 projects-areas countrywide are in receipt of funding or have been approved for inclusion under the family and community services resource centre programme. Expansion of the programme will continue in line with the recommendations of the Commission on the Family to establish a network of 100 such centres over a four to five year period.</P>
    <P>Some 40 projects-areas countrywide are in receipt of funding or have been approved for inclusion in the programme of core funding to locally based community and family support groups. The community development support programme is administered by the voluntary and <Col N="816" /> community services section of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which has the following staff allocated to the administration, implementation and policy development in relation to these and related programmes: one principal officer, one assistant principal officer, five higher executive officers, five executive officers and five clerical officers. Not all of these officers are exclusively devoted to the implementation of the national development plan measures; they also have other areas of responsibility. In addition, each of the regional offices of the Department has staff resources allocated to these programmes. The level of resources allocated varies from one region to the next to take account of local circumstances and the need to undertake other tasks.</P>
    <P>The family services pilot project is under way in three local offices of the Department &ndash; Waterford, Cork and Finglas in Dublin. The pilots, initiated in 2000, build on the one-stop-shop concept with the aim of providing improved access to information for families. An allocation of £12 million has been made in the national development plan for the development and expansion of the successful aspects of the project following the completion of the pilot phase. Some £1 million has been made available to the projects in 2001.</P>
    <P>The project is subject to ongoing evaluation during the pilot phase. A report has recently been completed and is being examined at management level in the Department to fully assess what would be involved and what resources would be required to effectively develop the project further. The pilots are being administered at regional level in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Officers at higher executive officer level in each region have been assigned to develop the project during the pilot phase. The pilots are overseen by a project management committee at official level within the Department. Two regional managers represent the Department at the twice yearly meetings of monitoring committees for the southern and eastern regional operational programme and the Border, midlands and western programme.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has ongoing, frequent and broad based contact with a wide variety of groups, both statutory and non-statutory, at local, regional and national level in carrying out its responsibilities to customers. This would include, in the context of the programmes being supported under the national development plan, a wide range of Government Departments, the Combat Poverty Agency, local partnerships, county development boards, health boards, etc, as well as a range of non-statutory organisations in the voluntary and community sector, including locally based groups, those which work with families and organisations, both statutory and non-statutory, and those which are active in employability and education support.</P>

      <P>Apart from minor fittings &ndash; tables and chairs &ndash; my Department has not funded any capital expenditure projects in Kildare South during 2000, nor is there any planned for 2001. In the Kerry South constituency the only capital expenditure planned by my Department for 2001 is furniture installation in a new local office at Caherciveen with a value of approximately £20,000. My Department did not fund any capital expenditure projects in the constituency during 2000.</P>
      <P>My Department supports locally-based community groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion work in their communities through a range of long-term funding schemes under the community development support programmes, namely, community development, the family and community services resource centre programme and the programme of core funding to locally based community and family support groups.</P>
      <P>My Department also funds a number of once-off grant schemes which concentrate on support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work. The once-off grants schemes are: the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations &ndash; these grants are made for renovation or acquisition of premises, the purchase of equipment or transport, once-off publications or research or other special projects; the community development education and training grants scheme, the purpose of which is to fund local community and voluntary groups for funding and education initiatives &ndash; for programmes which strengthen and increase the skills and knowledge of management committees, and the scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups grants are provided for programmes of self help and personal development designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage and improve family life.</P>

      <P>Social welfare improvements are normally implemented a number of months after the budget day announcements. This is necessary as a lead in time of a number of months is required in order to make the required legislative and administrative changes necessary to implement the budget increases, that is, enactment of the necessary social welfare legislation, printing of pension books, etc.</P>
      <P>The question of back-dating increases in social welfare payments to the date of the budget would be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context having regard to the available resources and in the light of the Government's other commitments.</P>
      <P>However, I have already announced that from 2002 all increases in weekly social welfare rates will coincide with the start of the tax year in early January. This will mean that the increases in social welfare weekly rates will have been brought forward by 23 weeks &ndash; over five months &ndash; since the Government came into office.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent to any person in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to a rent supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure the person, after payment of rent, has a weekly income equal to the <Col N="819" /> rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which a person is required to pay from his or her own resources towards accommodation costs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the minimum contribution, all applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the capital assistance scheme, capital grants are made available by the Department of Environment and Local Government, through local authorities, to approved voluntary bodies to provide accommodation for persons accepted as qualified for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The CAS scheme and rent supplementation to its tenants were examined as part of the December 1995 Report of the Review Group on the Role of Supplementary Welfare Allowance in relation to Housing. It was noted in that report that in addition to the non-repayable capital grants, subsidies were being paid under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, and SWA rent supplement was paid to the tenants. In the circumstances, it was decided to set a limit on the amount of rent supplement payable where the tenancy is in accommodation provided under the capital assistance scheme. This was set at £21 per week for a couple and £19 in any other case.</P>
    <P>These limits have recently been reviewed and I announced in budget 2001 that the rates would be increased by £10 per week with effect from April 2001. The new limits for tenants under the capital assistance scheme will be £31 for couples and £29 for single people.</P>
    <P>Rent supplements in general will be examined under the review of the SWA scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. A working group comprising officials from my Department and other relevant agencies has been established to carry out the review and a report is expected early next year. The level of rent supplementation to tenants of CAS schemes will be examined again by the working group as part of this review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various schemes within the social welfare system to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses. These include the payment of six weeks social welfare following the death of certain social welfare recipients or their spouse, the payment of a bereavement grant to insured people and their families and the payment of a funeral grant under the occupational injuries benefit.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came into office, I have introduced a number of important changes to improve these arrangements. These include an enhanced bereavement grant of £500 in 1999; the introduction of a once-off payment of £1,000 payable to widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for a widow-widower's contributory pension, one-parent family payment or a bereavement grant in Budget 2000; and a number of additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, to address the position where the six weeks after death payment was not made or was paid at a reduced amount.</P>
      <P>No additional payment is made in cases where the deceased spouse was in receipt of an invalidity pension and the survivor was in receipt of an old age contributory pension in his or her own right, neither is a payment made in cases where both spouses were each in receipt of an invalidity pension in their own right.</P>
      <P>However, the survivor in both instances, would be entitled to a bereavement grant of £500 and if the survivor had dependent children, he or she would also be entitled to a widowed parent's grant of £1,000. These arrangements will be kept under review in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions which specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid and the means test which must be <Col N="821" /> applied. Increases in weekly social welfare payment rates since 1997 are disregarded for the purposes of this means test as they would have the effect of reducing the rate of diet supplement payable in all cases and would eliminate entitlement altogether in many cases. The increases in social welfare payments for 2001 will also be disregarded for the purposes of the means test.</P>

      <P>While my Department does not have specific responsibility for the provision of community facilities in local authority or voluntary housing estates, projects funded under the various programmes-grants schemes operated by my Department, which are located in such areas, may serve as a resource to these communities.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a number of once-off grants schemes, namely: scheme of grants to voluntary organisations; scheme of grants to locally-based community and family support groups; and community development education and training grants scheme.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these grant schemes is to provide seed money to enable community groups operating in disadvantaged areas to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs. To qualify for funding, community groups must subscribe to a self-help community development ethos and must involve intended beneficiaries in the management and design of the project. The primary objective of these grant schemes is to develop people and their capacity to participate in society rather than at the provision of services, economic development or job creation initiatives.</P>
      <P>In addition to the once-off grants schemes as outlined above, my Department also supports locally based community groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion work in their communities through a range of long-term funding schemes which are collectively referred to as the community development support programmes. These programmes include the community development programme; the family and community services resource centre programme; and the programme of core funding to locally-based community and family support groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding provided under the once-off grant schemes and long-term funding programmes is intended to facilitate the development of communities and their capacity to participate more <Col N="822" /> effectively in society rather than on the provision of physical facilities or centres for these communities.</P>

      <Quest>the number of persons whose application for disability benefit or invalidity pension was not approved on the grounds of having contributions which would not qualify them, if any State or semi-State employees or former employees of such bodies fall into this category; if he has any plans to improve the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 326 and 327 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for social insurance benefits and pensions a person must have a certain standard of PRSI contributions at the appropriate PRSI rate. There are different rates of PRSI contributions which give <Col N="823" /> entitlement to different levels of benefits. In general, the rate of PRSI contribution payable is determined by the nature of the employment and the amount of the employee's earnings in any week.</P>
    <P>Most workers pay PRSI class A contributions, which provide cover for all social insurance benefit and pensions, including disability benefit and invalidity pension. However, people who earn less than £30 a week pay PRSI class J contributions, which provide cover for occupational injuries benefits only.</P>
    <P>The main other PRSI contribution classes are as follows. Permanent and pensionable workers in the public sector generally pay modified rates of PRSI contribution &ndash; classes B, C and D &ndash; which provide cover for a limited range of benefits, which do not include cover for disability benefit and invalidity pension.</P>
    <P>Such employees do, however, have their own occupational sick pay arrangements which, in general, provides for full pay for up to six months and half-pay for another six months. Where entitlement to sick leave with pay is exhausted, depending on the circumstances, a person can qualify for sick pay at pension rate, the level of which is determined by the length of service. Since 6 April 1995, all new recruits to the public service are insured at the PRSI class A rate.</P>
    <P>Non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel of the Defence Forces are insured at the PRSI class H rate, which provides cover for most social insurance benefits, including disability benefit and invalidity pension. However, only limited benefits are payable during service. Self-employed people are insured at the PRSI class S rate, which provides cover for old age, widow/widower's and orphan's pensions, maternity and adoptive benefits and bereavement grant.</P>
    <P>According to the latest statistics available on the insured population for the 1998-99 tax year, out of a total of 1,955,000 people insured for social insurance purposes, some 1,574,000 &ndash; 81% &ndash; people are insured for disability benefit and invalidity pension purposes. A further 10,500 &ndash; 0.5% &ndash; non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel of the Defence Forces are insured for disability benefit and invalidity pension on leaving the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for disability benefit a person must be incapable of work and satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions. To qualify for invalidity pension a person must be permanently incapable of work and satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions. Contributions paid at PRSI classes A, E, H and P count towards entitlement to disability benefit, while contributions paid at PRSI classes A, E and H count towards invalidity pension. Where a person is insured at one of these PRSI contribution classes, the payment of separate superannuation contributions will not have any impact on their entitlement to disability benefit or invalidity pension.</P>
    <P>Of a total of 1,832 claims for invalidity pension which were rejected in 2000, slightly over 400 &ndash;<Col N="824" /> 22% &ndash; were on the basis of a deficiency in their PRSI contribution record. It is not possible to identify the numbers of these rejected cases which relate to current and former public sector workers. Similar statistics are not available for disability benefit.</P>
    <P>In view of the occupational sick pay and disability pension arrangements for public sector workers and the fact that all new recruits to the public service are now insured for all social insurance benefits and pensions, there are no plans to make any further changes in this area.</P>

      <Quest>the number of recipients of various means tested payments who, in the past 12 months on qualifying for a further or alternative payment, actually receive a reduction in income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs administers a broad range of income support payments, comprising insurance &ndash; PRSI &ndash; based payment and social assistance &ndash; means tested &ndash; payments. The system is a contingency based one. Therefore, in order to qualify for a social welfare payment a person will first have to experience one of a number of contingencies, such as sickness, maternity, unemployment, old age, retirement, invalidity, widowhood, etc.</P>
      <P>However, it is possible for a person to experience more than one contingency at any one time. For instance, a widow could also be caring for another person. In this case, the woman could have an entitlement to both widow and widower's non-contributory pension and carer's allowance at the same time. As the concurrent payment of more than one payment is generally not allowed under the social welfare code, the woman would normally opt for the more financially beneficial payment, in this case the carer's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are cases where, because of a change in <Col N="825" /> circumstances, a recipient of a means tested payment is no longer entitled to that payment, but may qualify for another payment payable at a lower rate. For example, a carer who ceases caring duties will lose entitlement to the carer's allowance, that is, £80.50 a week, but may qualify instead for unemployment assistance, that is, £77.50 a week, if the person is available for and genuinely seeking employment.</P>
    <P>A number of the means-tested payments are payable only up to age 66 years, at which stage the old age non-contributory pension is payable. Under the provisions of the old age non-contributory pension scheme, means are generally assessed on a more favourable basis than they are under other social assistance schemes, including the unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance, farm assist and disability allowance schemes. Accordingly, a person who had been in receipt of one of these payments would, in the normal course, qualify for the old age non-contributory pension on reaching 66 years, the rate of which would generally be higher than that which they had previously been receiving.</P>
    <P>However, there will be some cases where a person would qualify for an old age pension at a lower rate than unemployment assistance, disability allowance, etc. For instance, a person's income position can change on reaching pension age, that is, the person or the spouse may qualify for an occupational pension or a social security pension from another State. Such income would then be assessable for old age pension purposes.</P>
    <P>I have also indicated to the Deputy on a number of previous occasions that there are a small number of cases where claimants for the old age non-contributory pension may be assessed with higher means than they had formerly been assessed with under the disability allowance scheme. This arises because of variations in the operation of the former disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme prior to its take-over by my Department.</P>
    <P>Because of the variety of circumstances in which a person may transfer from one means-tested payment onto another, it is not possible to compile statistics on the basis requested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The operation of the various means-tested payments administered by my Department is kept under review. While the principle of consistency across all social welfare means tests is desirable, it is important that this is balanced against the need to ensure that the social welfare system retains enough flexibility to be able to respond adequately to the specific needs of differing categories of customers. The different methods of assessing means as between the various social assistance payment schemes reflect, in many instances, specific policies being pursued by my Department, which are aimed at targeting particular groups of recipients for special attention.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department, where a person is qualified for payment under more than one scheme, to ensure that the person availed himself or herself of the more favourable payment. This type of situation arises on a regular basis, that is, where a person is qualified in his or her own right for a payment and simultaneously as a qualified adult on their spouses payment. The fact that in some cases a payment carries entitlement to additional benefits such as the free schemes means that it is not always a matter of simply opting for the higher rate of payment. In these situations the person is informed of the position and invited to make a choice.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, where difficulties arose in this regard, I will be happy to have it investigated by my Department, if he supplies the relevant details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 333 and 334 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the means tests which are applied to the various social assistance schemes administered by my Department is to ensure that the limited resources available are directed at those most in need. In assessing means account is taken of any cash income a person may have, for example, earnings from employment, together with the value of any capital or property. In addition, in the case of the unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance schemes, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant, such as the board and lodging in the family home, is assessed in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that there will be some 419,000 recipients of means tested social assistance payments in 2001. The maximum level of means <Col N="827" /> allowed under the various means tests is adjusted annually in line with the increases in the maximum weekly rates of payment. For instance, in the past four budgets weekly social assistance payments have been increased by between 26.7% and 41.5%. These increases are well in excess of the rate of inflation over the same period and represent real increases ranging between 11% and 24%. The maximum means thresholds have been similarly increased over the last four years.</P>
    <P>The question of using alternative mechanisms for up-rating the rates of social welfare payments <Col N="828" /> is currently being considered by a working group, which has been established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This working group is examining the range of complex issues associated with the adoption of alternative indexation measures for social welfare payments, including the long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications involved, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns.</P>
    <P>A list of various improvements in the means tests introduced in each of the last four budgets is set out in the following table:</P>

      <Quest>if persons over 75 years of age can obtain a fuel allowance, irrespective of means; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households and £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones.</P>
      <P>The conditions of the scheme are that the applicant must satisfy a means test, and must live alone or only with qualified dependents, a carer, a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right. There are no exceptions to these conditions on the basis of age and, consequently, people who are over 75 years of age must also satisfy the means test.</P>
      <P>People who qualify for means tested pensions or allowances such as old age non-contributory pension are accepted as satisfying the means test. However, if the household includes a person who is in receipt of disability benefit, unemployment benefit or occupational injury benefit, then that household will not qualify for a fuel allowance. The benefit recipient could qualify for a £3 smokeless fuel allowance if they are residing in one of the specified areas and are on benefit for more than three months.</P>
      <P>In the case of contributory pensioners such as old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensioners, the income of the qualified adult is assessable as means for the purpose of entitlement to a fuel allowance. A person may now have a combined household income of up to £30 per week or savings-investments of up to £30,000 over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to simplify the social welfare and related systems, whenever possible. The Deputy will be aware that progress is being made in relation to easing the means tests for schemes such as free electricity and for the medical card. At present, the free schemes are not subject to a means test in the case of people aged 75 years or more and the means test for the <Col N="830" /> free schemes is being abolished for people aged 70 and above from May 2001.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of fuel allowances to pensioners and am providing an additional £6 million for the scheme this year. The income limit to which I referred will be increased to £40 from October 2001.</P>
    <P>In addition, the fuel season has been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks, as announced in the 2001 budget. The current fuel season will be extended by two weeks in April 2001 and the next fuel season will start one week earlier in October 2001.</P>
    <P>Any further changes in eligibility for fuel allowances would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>
    <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment, exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 347 of 12 December 2000, if she will reverse her decision not to pursue a suggestion that a wider review of the future funding mechanisms for the State broadcaster be instituted, particularly in view of the extensive extracts from the RTE licence fee submission published in a newspaper (details supplied); her views on whether RTE should generate an operating profit on its existing services; her views on whether it will be necessary to raise the annual licence fee to £200 or more in the coming years to finance its digital proposal; and the way in which she proposes to reconcile the requirements of the protocol to preserve public service broadcasting in the Amsterdam Treaty with the growing demands for fairer competition between private broadcasters and State funded broadcasters.</Quest>

      <P>My position as outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 347 of 12 December 2000 has not changed. I recently <Col N="832" /> received the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers who were commissioned to carry out an independent and objective analysis of RTE's application for a £50 increase in the TV licence fee. The report is being examined by officials of my Department and my intention is to bring proposals to Government as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In regard to its finances RTE is obliged, under Section 24 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, to conduct its affairs so that its revenue is, at least, sufficient to meet all sums properly chargeable to its current account and to make suitable provision with respect to capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it is my function to reconcile the provisions of the protocol on public service broadcasting attached to the Amsterdam Treaty with the demands of private sector broadcasters.</P>

      <P>Waterways Ireland, a North-South Implementation Body for inland waterways, was established on 2 December 1999 on foot of the British-Irish Agreement and the supplementary Implementation Bodies Agreement signed in March 1999. Accordingly the matter raised by him is now one to be dealt with by Waterways Ireland and not by me as Minister.</P>
      <P>However, Waterways Ireland advises me that a study has jointly been commissioned with ESB. The terms of reference are: to examine the management of water levels on the Shannon, by both Waterways Ireland and ESB, for navigation and electricity generation purposes and assess the impact, if any, of this operational regime on flood levels.</P>
      <P>This study is being undertaken by consultants Kirk, McClure and Morton and it is expected that the final report will be presented to Waterways Ireland and ESB around mid-April.</P>

      <P>Any owner of property rights over lands in special areas of conservation that are the subject of turfcutting restrictions, is entitled to compensation for financial losses aris<Col N="833" /> ing from the restrictions on the use of those rights. My Department currently has no application for compensation from, or on behalf of, the named person.</P>
      <P>It is not clear whether the individual is a commercial turfcutter or is cutting turf for his own domestic use. In order to establish entitlement to compensation, a commercial turfcutter must provide proof of ownership, vouched income, receipts and audited accounts. A current tax clearance certificate must also be made available for inspection. The use of sausage machines is not permitted within SACs but the use of other machines in areas where people have been cutting for their own domestic use, may continue for a fixed period.</P>

      <P>My Department's proposals to undertake works on the paving around St. Stephen's Green, Dublin, involves the replacement of two sides of the existing perimeter initially. Moreover, the existing paving on the perimeter around St. Stephen's Green is entirely made of concrete, while the bollards and kerbing are virtually all Wicklow granite. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department proposes to replace the concrete paving with granite flagstones, so the outcome of the work to be undertaken will, by any standards, represent a significant enhancement to this historic park which is situated in the centre of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The position at the moment is that, given the scale of the tenders received for this project relative to the funds at my disposal it was necessary to reconsider the options in conjunction with the Office of Public Works. I propose to address this matter by seeking new tenders for revised proposals. In this regard the Deputy will of course appreciate that Government contract procedures must be complied with during this process.</P>

      <P>Special areas of conservation are proposed by my Department for designation under the EU Habitats Directive. Owners and users of land within proposed SACs are consulted, following which lists of candidate sites are transmitted to the EU Commission. Formal designation of the sites will only take place after lists have been adopted by the Commission. The purpose of establishing SACs is to conserve types of habitats and species specified in annexes I and II of the Habitats Directive. Suitable sites are selected in accordance with scientific criteria set out in annex III of the Habitats Directive, a copy of which follows. A parkland would have to host habitats or species listed in the habitats in order to merit consideration for SAC designation. Natural heritage areas were first proposed some years ago, on a non-statutory basis, but the Wild<Col N="840" /> life (Amendment) Act, 2000 provides a statutory basis for their formal designation. This is a purely national designation. The criteria used in selecting sites are broadly similar to those applying to SACs, but are not confined to a specified list of habitats and species. NHAs will conserve habitats and species listed in the Habitats Directive and additional habitats and species, of importance in the Irish context, as well as areas with a geological or geomorphological interest.</P>

      <P>(a)Degree of representativity of the natural habitat type on site.</P>
      <P>(b)Area of the site covered by the natural habitat type in relation to the total area covered by that natural habitat type within national territory.</P>
      <P>(c)Degree of conservation of the structure and functions of the natural habitat type concerned and restoration possibilities.</P>

      <P>(d)Global assessment of the value of the site for conservation of the species concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A.On the basis of these criteria, Member States will classify the sites which they propose on <Col N="841" /> the national list as sites eligible for identification as sites of Community importance according to their relative value for the conservation of each natural type in Annex I or each species in Annex II.</P>

    <P>1.All the sites identified by the Member States in Stage 1 which contain priority natural habitat types and/or species will be considered as sites of Community importance.</P>
    <P>2.The assessment of the Community importance of other sites on Member States' lists, i.e. their contribution to maintaining or re-establishing, at a favourable conservation status, a natural habitat in annex I or a species in Annex II and/or to the coherence of Natura 2000 will take account of the following criteria:</P>
    <P>(a)relative value of the site at national level;</P>
    <P>(b)geographical situation of the site in relation to migration routes of species in Annex II and whether it belongs to a continuous ecosystem situated on both sides of one or more internal Community frontiers;</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999, a nation-wide survey is currently being carried out by my Department to help identify structures and buildings which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, <Col N="842" /> cultural, scientific, social or technical interest. The Government is committed to completing all interim county surveys within the next two years and the complete national inventory within a period of 12 years.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority must, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. Under Section 4 of the Act, I may recommend to a planning authority that specific structures be included in its record of protected structures.</P>
      <P>As surveys are published I will be recommending to planning authorities that structures rated as being of regional, national or international importance be included in the record of protected structures. To date, the town surveys of Ballina and Castlebar have been published. I have, accordingly, recommended that 29 buildings in Ballina and 57 in Castlebar be included in the record of protected structures of the relevant planning authority. I have forwarded a list of the buildings concerned to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The decision to include buildings in the record of protected structures rests with the elected representatives in each planning authority. If they do not propose accepting my recommendation in any individual case they are required to advise me of the reasons for their decision. In this regard, Ballina Urban District Council has decided to accept my recommendation in respect of 26 of the buildings. The response of Castlebar Urban District Council is awaited.</P>

      <Quest>if she will report on the progress by South Dublin, Fingal and Kildare County Councils in utilising the grant allocation of £3.75 million for the development of Lucan Demesne/St. Catherine's lands, County Dublin as a major passive park amenity in the Liffey Valley in view of the conditions set which required the earliest opening up of parkland to the public; if any section of the land is yet open to public access; if indicative dates have been given to her in this regard; and if she will provide assurances that her Department is closely moni toring the utilisation of the significant Exchequer funding set aside for the project.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware Lucan Demesne was acquired by my Department in 1996 with the objective of establishing a Liffey Valley Park, to be owned and managed on a co-operative basis by the three local authorities concerned on the basis of an agreed management plan. In addition my Department has secured funding for the park amounting to £3.75 million over a five year period.</P>
      <P>Revised contract documents for the transfer of the land have recently been sent to Fingal County Council and Kildare County Council and it is hoped that these can be completed in the near future. The legal formalities in respect of South Dublin County Council have already been completed. Once the legal transfer of the land has been completed it will be possible to commence implementation of the management plan with the aim of opening the park to the public as soon as possible. The role of my Department will then be to disburse funds, allocated by the Department of Finance, on foot of projects carried out in accordance with the agreed management plan.</P>
      <P>I understand that there is public access to the portion of the demesne which is under the control of South Dublin County Council. As for the remainder of the demesne, no indicative dates have been given to me in this regard pending completion of the legal formalities. The question of the opening of the park is primarily a matter for the three local authorities concerned.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that there were four seizures containing cocaine base (crack), with a combined weight of 72.6 grammes, during 2000. All of these seizures occurred in the Dublin Metropolitan Region; three in the North Central Division and one in the South Central Division. The gardaí have also informed me that there have been no seizures of cocaine base this year, to date.</P>
      <P>A special operation is in place to investigate the appearance of crack cocaine and a particular group is being targeted in this regard. I am assured by the Garda Authorities that there is no evidence to suggest a growing presence or the widespread availability of crack cocaine in Dublin or elsewhere in the country and that they continuously monitor and analyse the trends and patterns in illicit drug use based upon seizure data. They are well aware from foreign experience of the addictive and behaviour changing nature of crack cocaine and in this context, the incidence of cocaine base usage will be kept under review, with the utmost urgency being attached to investigations in this area.</P>

      <P>The position regarding direct provision remains the same as outlined in my reply to Question No. 137 of 30 November 2000. I continue to believe that the system of direct provision represents a fair and effective means of meeting the basic needs of asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>The situation regarding English language classes is that the children of asylum seekers are entitled to primary and post-primary education in the same way as Irish children. If they have significant English language deficits the school they are attending is entitled to additional teaching resources. The level of this support is dependent on the number of children of asylum seekers attending the school with significant English language deficits.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science provides annual grants to vocational education committees under the adult literacy and community education scheme (ALCES) for the provision of tuition in literacy and basic education to adults. They may use these grants to provide adult literacy and English language supports to asylum seekers. The Department of Education and Science is also supporting a pilot project initiated by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee (CDVEC) to assess what the level of language needs of asylum seekers are likely to be and to develop models as to how best to implement the arrangements and the Department of Education and Science, through the Refugee Language Support Unit, provides, on request, in service training for those teaching asylum seekers.</P>

    <P>The period for implementation in all cases is over the life of the National Development Plan, 2000-06.</P>
    <P>Progress on my Department's measures is as follows. The equal opportunities child care programme has three sub-measures as follows. The capital grants scheme is available to community based groups and private child care providers catering for no more that 20 children at any one time. At the end of January 2001 a total of 168 projects had been approved for funding under the sub-measure. A total of £9.316 million 11.829 million euro, has been committed to these projects.</P>
    <P>Support for staffing costs is available to community based groups only. To the end of January 2001 a total of 153 projects had been approved under this measure with a total of £17.316 million, 21.987 million euro, committed thereto.</P>
    <P>The quality improvement programme provides funding for national voluntary child care organisations, local child care networks, county child care committees, local child care training models and innovative projects. To the end of January 2001 a total of 12 projects had been approved under this sub-measure at a cost of £9.142 million, 11.608 million euro. As the programme is ongoing and projects are approved on a monthly basis, it is not possible to predict the final number of projects which will be allocated funding under the child care measure.</P>
    <P>I launched the equality for women measure on 5 October 2000 and invited project applications for particular strands. Over 350 project proposals were received by the closing date and these are now undergoing appraisal. I plan to announce details in April of projects which qualify for funding under the measure until 2003. The measure is <Col N="853" /> also supporting the national framework committee on the development of family friendly policies at the level of the enterprise. The committee was established under the PPF and is planning a programme of activities, including a family friendly workplace day on 1 March, a website, brochure and seminars. The Equality Authority is receiving funding to gender proof personnel policies and advertised for a panel of experts to carry out this work. The measure is also funding a number of research projects.</P>
    <P>A new unit, the NDP gender equality unit, has been established within my Department to support all implementing Departments and delivery agencies to meet the NDP commitments on gender equality in their programmes, measures and initiatives. Funded initially with the aid of EU technical assistance and now funded under the NDP, the unit has contracted for the collection of existing gender disaggregated statistics relevant to the plan. This has now been completed and is available on the Department's website, www.irlgov.ie/justice/equality/gender/. A contract has recently been placed to collect further gender disaggregated statistics on housing and mode of transport. Some 300 officials from Departments, implementing agencies and social partnership organisations have attended gender mainstreaming training sessions in 2000, two of which were held in the regions. A further training programme is being undertaken in 2001, focused on the sectoral areas of education, transport, housing, enterprise and industry and agriculture and rural development. The unit has also advised on the gender impact of all measures funded under the plan. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform plans to expand the unit by recruiting more staff, particularly to focus on the development of gender disaggregated statistics and gender mainstreaming. The implementation of the equal opportunities commitment in the NDP will be monitored over the life of the plan.</P>
    <P>The CONNECT prisons service project was developed on a pilot basis at Mountjoy Prison, the training unit and the Dóchas centre &ndash; the new women's prison &ndash; in Dublin over the period 1998 to 1999. The pilot project developed methodologies for building effective linkages from custody to labour market participation after release for people in custody. During the year 2000 the earlier pilot project was consolidated in the three start-up prisons, and preparations were made to bring the project to the other prisons in Ireland. By the end of 2000 slightly more than 700 ex-offenders had participated in the programme. In the months of January and February of 2001 the project is being initiated in five more prisons, Wheatfield and St. Patrick's Institution in Dublin, Cork and Limerick prisons and Castlerea Prison.</P>
    <P>Under the crime prevention measure, the probation and welfare service will provide a broad range of interventions to underpin supervision of ex-offenders in the community and the construction of 11 centres. The 11 centres will provide pre-vocational training to facilitate re-entry to the <Col N="854" /> labour market. The precise scheduling to be determined by the pace of local negotiations. Already a booking deposit has been paid on a property in Sligo and discussions have commenced with owners in Tallaght and Athlone.</P>
    <P>The Garda youth diversion programme sub-measure comprises a total of 22 projects, and this number will increase further this year. The budgeted cost of the sub-measure is £16 million over the life of the plan. With respect to the local development measure, my Department has responsibility for seven projects, and their total budgeted cost comes to approximately £1.3 million, again over the life of the plan.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for a number of measures under the national development plan. These include the equal opportunities child care programme, an equality for women measure, an equal opportunities promotion and monitoring unit, a measure to prepare prisoners for employment after their release, a crime prevention measure, a Garda youth diversion development programme and a number of community based drug use awareness projects.</P>
      <P>Under the child care measure my Department is in regular contact with a broad range of organisations through a number of structures designed to ensure the co-ordination of delivery of child care service provision over the term of the national development plan. These are as follows: the national co-ordinating child care committee, NCCC, is chaired by my Department and oversees the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country. The membership of this committee, excluding local authorities, comprises my Department, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Department of Health and Children, the ICTU, IBEC, Chambers of Commerce in Ireland, the community and voluntary pillar, the farming pillar, national voluntary child care organisations, FÁS, Dublin Institute of Technology Rathmines, health boards, county child care committee representatives, Area Development Management Limited, the Border, Midlands and Western Regional Assembly, the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly, National Women's Council of Ireland and PLANET.</P>

    <P>Membership of the certifying bodies sub-group to develop a framework for child care training and qualifications comprises my Department, <Col N="855" /> FÁS, Dublin Institute of Technology Rathmines, the National Council for Vocational Awards, the National Council for Education Awards and University College Cork.</P>
    <P>Membership of the advisory group on disability and ethnicity comprises my Department, Pavee Point, One Parent Exchange Network, the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, the Irish Refugee Council, the Forum for People with Disabilities, An Comhcoiste Réamhscolaíochta Teo, Údarás na Gaeltachta, the ISPCC, Area Development Management Limited, Children's Rights Alliance, the Irish Preschool Playgroup Association and the Jack and Jill Foundation.</P>
    <P>There is an interdepartmental synergies group to encourage Departments and State agencies with funding for child care to work strategically together. Membership of this committee comprises my Department, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, health boards, FÁS, the National Council for Vocational Awards, the Dublin Institute of Technology and Area Development Management Limited.</P>
    <P>County child care committees have been established to advance child care service provision at local levels. The health boards are facilitating the establishment of the committees which will have wide representation from statutory and non-statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>In relation to the equality for women measure, a technical advisory committee has been formed to advise on the development of the measure. The committee is comprised of representatives from my Department, the regional assemblies, the Department of Education and Science, FÁS, Enterprise Ireland, the enterprise boards, the Equality Authority, the National Women's Council of Ireland and the four pillars of social partnership.</P>
    <P>The equal opportunities promotion and monitoring unit is in regular consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies in promoting a gender mainstreaming approach to expenditure under the NDP. The unit is in regular contact with all Departments and implementing agencies which receive funding under the national development plan as well as with the social partners, including community and voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>The measure to prepare prisoners for employment after their release involves ongoing contact, which is largely informal, with many groups and individuals, both statutory and non-stautory, concerned mainly with providing services for prisoners while they are in custody and also arranging for them to receive necessary supports in the wider community after their release. These contacts, including with employers, are made usually pursuant to the needs of individual prisoners.</P>
    <P>One of the tasks of the project is to strengthen linkages between the Department and the Irish Prisons Service and other agencies which can con<Col N="856" /> tribute to prisoner rehabilitation, including linkage at the level of the local community. There are about 15 organisations with which there is regular ongoing contact or consultation in relation to implementing the measure.</P>
    <P>Under the crime prevention measure, the probation and welfare service has established the linkage project in partnership with the Dublin business community and IBEC, which engages employment and training support workers, funded partly by the NDP, to assist the integration of ex-offenders into the labour force and the community. The service, in advancing treatment of ex-offenders under the NDP, negotiated arrangements with the management of four residential centres to address substance abuse issues with ex-offenders referred by the service. Consultation will also be undertaken with statutory and community groups, including local residents as well as service providers, in the proposed locations for the new centres.</P>
    <P>Under the Garda youth diversion programme my Department is in regular contact with An Garda Síochána in relation the implementation of the programme and the community based drug use awareness-prevention projects for which my Department is responsible, as that organisation is the intermediary body and/or project promoter for these activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Maternity Protection Act, 1994, has been amended by means of an order which was made on 8 February 2001. This amendment entitles a pregnant employee who commences maternity leave at any time on or after 8 March 2001 to maternity leave consisting of 18 consecutive weeks' leave, which attracts a payment, and eight consecutive weeks' unpaid leave. A woman who would be due to commence additional unpaid maternity leave on or after 8 March 2001 will be entitled to avail of eight weeks' unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>As the person to whom the Deputy refers is already on maternity leave, she will not be entitled to the increased period of paid leave. However, if she does not commence unpaid maternity leave until on or after 8 March, she will be entitled to apply for eight weeks' unpaid leave instead of four weeks if she so wishes. There is no provision under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, for increased entitlements to leave in respect of multiple births.</P>
      <P>I wish to clarify the position regarding the commencement date for the increased entitlements. As part of the budget announcement on 6 December 2000, the Minister for Finance announced that the increased entitlements would apply from early April 2001. Most increases provided by the annual Social Welfare Bill apply from April or even later.</P>
      <P>After the budget announcement, officials in my Department looked into the possibility of applying the maternity leave increases not only to women who commence maternity leave from early April but also to women who go on leave prior to that date. This issue was examined in conjunction with officials from the Departments of Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Attorney General's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that an order made under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, would comply <Col N="858" /> with that Act. The Attorney General advised me that it would not be possible to have the order extend the increased period of maternity leave to those persons who could not comply with the notice requirements of the parent Act, that is, to employer by employees, and that any attempt to make the order retrospective could be deemed to adversely affect the rights of employers and would be open to challenge. The increases in maternity leave are not merely a matter of the State paying out extra weeks of maternity benefit. They have a major impact on employers in many ways, for example, the need to replace employees for a longer period than expected, and, in some cases, contractual obligations in respect of payment. The effective dates of the increases as set out in the order take account of the notice requirements under the Act. The position, therefore, is that the need to comply with the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, limited the extent to which the increases could be applied to persons already on maternity leave.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 375 and 376 together.</P>
      <P>An appointment has now been made in respect of the post of head of administration, Waterford. The duties and responsibilities of the post were outlined in the circular which advertised the position. I understand that most management posts in the Land Registry have a mixture of responsibilities, both administrative and case work. In accordance with best management practice, the number of persons, including managers, working in non-core areas of the business are kept under tight control.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the reporting arrangements between the head of administration in the Land Registry office in Waterford and the manager is similar to that of other posts at that level in the organisation. I understand that these arrangements have been fully discussed and agreed with the new office holder.</P>

    <P>The numbers of certificates issued or applications refused in a given year do not necessarily refer to applications received in that year. In relation to the number of applications refused, it is likely that a number of these persons would have been naturalised subsequently on foot of a further application. Statistics are not compiled in such a manner which shows the number of applicants from each country of origin. It would involve a disproportionate use of staff resources to prepare such an analysis.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has applied in the United Kingdom for a transfer to serve the balance of his sentence here under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. My Department has recently received a formal application for transfer of the person concerned from the United Kingdom authorities and it is now being examined by the Chief State Solicitor to establish that the offence for which the person was sentenced would also constitute an offence in this jurisdiction and that the sentence imposed is broadly in line with what would have been imposed in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions to allow an application to be fully considered. A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, that is, from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents and assuming they are <Col N="863" /> forthcoming, an application will be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his or her continued detention here.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that upwards of 4,000 patrons are discharged on to the streets from six night clubs operating in the city at approximately 2.30 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday. As a result of this increased activity, the Garda Síochána has noted an increase in the number of public order incidents, predominantly at weekends. I am also informed that local Garda management have deployed additional resources on weekend nights to target such public order offences and that their belief is that the resulting increased presence on the streets is the best means of addressing the situation in the long term.</P>
      <P>In addition, Garda strength in Kilkenny has steadily increased in recent years. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the manpower strength, all ranks, at Kilkenny Garda station on 1 January for each of the past three years was as set out in the following table:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 391 and 395 together.</P>
      <P>The proposals to put a programme in place which would target support and investment to the most deprived 25 areas in the State was discussed and approved by the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion in December 2000. The programme, known as RAPID, Revitalising Areas by Planning, Investment and Development, was launched on 8 February 2001. The designation of the 25 most deprived areas in the State, to be the target of support under the RAPID Programme has been agreed by Government on the basis of clear and objective criteria.</P>
      <P>Underpinning this designation is the Trutz-Haase index, an independent analysis of the relative levels of deprivation, which used 11 broad variables drawn from the 1996 census of population and involved 75 separate items of data per DED. To limit the selection to the 25 most deprived areas, it was necessary to confine the list to those DEDs which fell within the category of &ldquo;the most deprived 5% of DEDs in the State&rdquo; in accordance with this index.  The DEDs thus identified were suitably clustered and the boundaries adjusted to include neighbourhoods of local authority housing in which in excess of 75% of housing stock is rented.</P>
      <P>The delivery mechanism provides for an extensive level of community participation. A budget has been allocated for implementation. Any requests to extend the designation beyond that agreed by Government would involve a change in the designation process, an easing in criteria, and a requirement that access to the programme should be provided to all other areas of similar economic and social standing. As this approach would have serious implications for the current strong focus of the programme on areas of the greatest disadvantage, I do not propose to make any amendments to the boundaries of the areas selected. The social partners, including the community and voluntary pillar, which were involved in the devising of the programme, have welcomed the RAPID programme and have indicated their support for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 396 to 400, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-06 my Department has lead responsibility for the design and launch of programmes for investment totalling £800 million in three distinct areas: tourism initiatives, regional sport and recreational facilities, and local development initiatives. It also has responsibility for contributing to the monitoring of progress on those programmes.</P>
      <P>Each of these areas falls into a number of measures and sub-measures which fall respectively within the following operational programmes. The productive sector operational programme contains a tourism marketing measure for which £150 million has been provided and which comprises two sub-measures, destination marketing and niche marketing.</P>
      <P>The employment and human resource development operational programme contains tourism training for which there is an allocation of £107 million and which comprises three sub-measures, transition from second level education to job placement within the tourism industry, provision of training and employment interventions at national, regional and local levels for the unemployed, women returning to paid employment, early school leavers and the socially excluded, and facilitation of improving and maintaining the highest operational standards in tourism and the provision of training or development intervention for persons already working in industry with the primary focus on human resource management and operational best practice.</P>
      <P>The regional operational programmes for the southern and eastern and Border, midlands and western regions each contain tourism product development among their local enterprise priorities for which there is an allocation of £100 million and which comprises three sub-measures, development of major attractors and clusters of existing attractions, special interest pursuits and tourism-environment management. Operational guidelines are being prepared by Bord Fáilte in consultation with my Department and therefore no project proposals have yet been invited.</P>
      <P>The BMW and S and E regional operational programmes also contain a sports and recreational sub-measure within their respective local infrastructure sub-programme, in respect of which £85 million is provided. The commencement of this initiative is dependent on the completion of the national spatial strategy and the identification of regional gateways. This is scheduled to be later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social inclusion and child care sub-programme of the S and E and BMW regional oper<Col N="871" /> ational programmes contain local development measures for which £360 million has been provided. These provide for local implementing agencies, such as area-based partnership companies, community groups and local drugs task forces, to adopt a partnership approach to tackling local issues on the basis of comprehensive, integrated local action plans designed to counter social exclusion and the related problem of drug misuse in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the European Commission is largely at operational programme level and this is the responsibility of the relevant managing authorities. The managing authorities for the S and E and BMW regional operational programmes are the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly and the Border, Midlands and Western Regional Assembly respectively. The managing authority for both the productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development operational programme is the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. They have been responsible respectively for the drafting of the operational programmes and programme complements with appropriate input from the various Departments, including my own. They have led negotiations and discussions with the European Commission and are also responsible for the overall monitoring of the operational programmes. As a result, direct contact at senior EU official level regarding measures under the NDP have been with the management authorities, advised by the various Departments.</P>
    <P>Apart from the tourism product development measure, all NDP initiatives for which this Department has responsibility are totally funded by the Exchequer. No consultants were hired by the Department specifically to assist with the design or implementation of the Department's NDP initiatives, although there were detailed negotiations with the various implementing agencies and interested parties. Experience under the previous two CSF programmes was also taken into account.</P>
    <P>The NDP initiatives for which this Department has responsibility involve practically every section of the Department although the work carried out on the NDP is only part of the day to day work of the staff in these sections, falling within the duties of two assistant secretaries, five principal officers, six assistant principal officers, two higher executive officers or administrative officers and one executive officer. This excludes support from corporate services.</P>
    <P>In addition to the managing authorities, the groups with which the Department is in regular contact or consultation regarding the implementation of the measures of the NDP for which it has responsibility are Bord Fáilte, CERT, Area Development Management Limited, the national drugs strategy team and the national advisory committee on drugs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> No public-private partnerships are under consideration or have been identified as potential possibilities. However, decisions in relation to tourism marketing funding are taken in consultation with the Tourism Marketing Partnership, which is a private-public arrangement.</P>

      <P>Following is a list of the capital grants which I allocated to County Kildare under the 2000 Sports Capital Programme. The scheme is administered on a county rather than constituency basis.</P>
      <P>Under the 2001 Sports Capital Programme, applications for funding were invited by way of public advertisement on 15 and 17 December 2000 and the closing date for receipt of applications was 9 February 2001. Over 1,450 applications have been received. Until all of these applications have been assessed it will not be possible to state the value of applications and the level of grants to be allocated to projects under the 2001 programme. I intend to make allocations under this programme as soon as all applications received under the programme have been assessed in accordance with the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. An amount of £20 million is provided for in the Estimates for expenditure in 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the Education Act it is a function of the board of management of each school to publish the policy of the school relating to participation by students with special educational needs, including students who are exceptionally able. The measures the school take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan. It is the duty of the board of management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students.</P>
      <P>In recent years new syllabi and curricula have been devised for second-level schools. These have been designed in such a way that the differing needs of a wide range of pupil ability can be catered for by their teachers. The revised primary curriculum, which has been supplied to every primary teacher, recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils.</P>
      <P>While content is outlined in the curricula at both levels, process is also heavily emphasised. Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated. The development of language skills, investigatory and problem-solving skills, higher-order thinking skills and working individually and as a member of a group are all encouraged at both levels. While the use of information and communication technologies and the use of class and school libraries is of benefit in project work with all pupils, they have a special importance for pupils who are exceptionally able.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of particular significance at second level are the International Olympiads in the science subjects, in information technology and in mathematics, in which the exceptionally able and highest achieving pupils compete. There is also an increase in the number of teachers who are adopting approaches to teaching thinking skills such as de Bono's programme, Feuerstein's Instrumental Enrichment and Lipman's Philosophy for Children. In general, schools at both primary and second level attempt to use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the <Col N="876" /> development of pupils who are exceptionally able.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department provides funding of £50,000 per annum to the Centre for Talented Youth at Dublin City University to support its work in delivering programmes which are designed specifically for exceptionally able children of first and second level age.</P>

      <P>All available learning support teacher posts have been allocated, as part of the process of extending the learning support service to every primary school in the country, with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. The school referred to by the Deputies has a learning support teacher which it shares with another school in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that the learning support needs of the school in question will be taken <Col N="877" /> fully into account in the event of additional learning support teacher posts becoming available for distribution. I would also point out that the school in question has been included in the new programme which I recently launched to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. As a result of its inclusion in this initiative, the school has been allocated three additional teaching posts to facilitate a reduction in its class sizes to a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1. Also as part of this arrangement, the school is being allocated extra funding of £2,930 to support its efforts to address its current problems.</P>
    <P>An acting director of programmes, assisted by an experienced support team, has been appointed to oversee the operation of this new initiative. The acting director of programmes and her support team will be working closely with the selected schools, including the school to which the Deputies refer, to assist them in utilising the resources now being made available to develop approaches which are best suited to addressing the needs of their pupils.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the issues raised in correspondence (details supplied) relating to the resourcing of voluntary secondary schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the request by voluntary secondary schools for increased funding referred to in the correspondence. The funding arrangements for the different school types at second level have evolved in a manner that reflect the <Col N="878" /> different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. This evolution has, by its very nature, generated funding anomalies and structures that lack uniformity and cohesion.</P>
      <P>At the core of funding arrangements at second level is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, which are privately managed institutions, the Department meets the cost of teacher salaries, excluding the first £400, and allowances, and makes an annual <i>per capita </i>grant towards recurrent costs, including cleaning of schools. In addition, these schools may also be eligible for assistance under a range of other grants available under the scheme, including grants for the employment of secretaries and caretakers and curricular support.</P>
      <P>Regarding insurance cover on school property and against public liability, this is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs provided by my Department by way of <i>per capita </i>grants may be used for this purpose. I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements, including the matter of equity of funding between the different sectors at second level.</P>
      <P>While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding. In this connection I have already shown my commitment through the establishment of the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. This funding initiative represents a new approach by my Department that supports the school development planning process. This process can only be enhanced if each school is given some flexibility in the deployment of its resources. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking services, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interest of their pupils and for the operation of their schools.</P>
      <P>A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year. In addition, the standard <i>per capita </i>grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita </i>grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> My approach has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and I intend to build further on progress to date.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to parliamentary questions concerning funding for VTOS programmes under the aegis of Westmeath VEC, he will comment on the reason the average allowance, per student, for non-pay items such as rent, class materials, IT equipment and others has decreased from £1,013 in 1997 to £738 in 2000 despite the fact that costs for these items have significantly increased.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department funds the operational costs of the vocational training opportunity scheme, VTOS, in the form of grants to vocational education committees which cover (a) pay, (b) non-pay and (c) training, travel and meal allowances. The non-pay element of the grant is used to cover the costs of premises, equipment, books and other overheads. VTOS students attend courses either in core, stand alone, class groups, or as students dispersed on other programmes, such as PLC or leaving certificate courses. For core groups, the non-pay funding norm is £15,000 per annum per group of 20. For dispersed students, a grant of £500 per pupil is paid with the remaining costs covered by the normal non-pay grants for the particular programme. These norms are adjusted further to ensure that the grants paid do not exceed the VEC's projected expenditure in any year, and to take account of any surpluses on hand at the end of the preceding year. In addition, to give added advantage, the number of core students may be rounded upwards to a complete group, and a corresponding adjustment made to the dispersed rate of grant.</P>
      <P>Consequently, although the funding norms for VTOS have not changed, the actual unit costs per student issued may vary from year to year depending on fluctuations in class group size, funds on hands and expenditure incurred, and the numbers of core versus dispersed students. The primary costs for overheads arise by virtue of the number of class groups, rather than the number of students within each group.</P>
      <P>The development of VTOS features strongly in the Back to Education Initiative, as set out in the recent White Paper on Adult Education Learning for Life. Under this measure, £1.027 billion will be provided under the national development plan over the period of the plan for the development of a number of programmes, including VTOS, which will involve a significant expansion of part-time options. The resources for the programme will be examined in that context.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware I recently announced a new £6.1 million arts and music grant for all primary schools. The grant will enable schools to purchase equipment and materials and to initiate activities to enable children to participate in visual arts, music, drama, dance and literature. The grant works out at £13 per pupil with a minimum grant of £780 being provided for schools of under 60 pupils. The grant <Col N="881" /> was lodged to schools' bank accounts in late November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of music the grant may be used to support the making of music through instruments such as chime bars, cymbals, triangles and tin whistles. It can also be used to buy listening materials such as compact discs and tapes. Similarly in the visual arts schools will be enabled to purchase materials such as brushes, drawing and colouring materials. It is my intention that schools would, where possible, use some of this money to <Col N="882" /> organise trips to concert halls, art galleries and similar institutions so that children experience music, visual arts, drama, dance and literature in such settings. More detailed guidelines are being drafted by my Department at present. These guidelines will issue to all schools shortly and will set out the scope of the grant and the purposes for which it can be used.</P>

However, this matter is under active consideration at present and the development by South Dublin County Council of an area action plan for Adamstown will assist my Department considerably in that regard.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department's planning section meet on a regular basis with the planning department of South Dublin County Council with a view to identifying the need for additional educational provision and reserving sites for schools as necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has sanctioned the establishment of two special classes for pupils with autism in the Lucan Educate Together School. Two permanent teacher posts and two special needs assistant posts have already been allocated to the school to facilitate this development. In addition, arrangements are being made to allocate a further two special needs assistant posts to the school in line with my decision to double the level of such support available to every class catering for children with autism.</P>
      <P>The special classes in question were originally due to become operational in January 2001. However, I understand that the commencement date has had to be postponed due to a range of factors. These included difficulties experienced by the board of management in securing the services of a suitable teacher for one of the special classes. I understand that the school authorities are continuing their efforts to recruit a suitable teacher. I also understand that work on a planned new building to accommodate the Lucan Educate Together School necessitated the opening of a second entrance at the site and that this has delayed the opening of the new special classes. I am hopeful that these matters will be resolved in the near future.</P>

The specific responsibility for these schools has been <Col N="884" /> assigned to an individual psychologist from NEPS since July 2000 and the post is within the overall approved allocation of psychologist posts within NEPS. The release of a teacher to undergo relevant training is a matter in the first instance for the authorities of the school concerned.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 422 and 423 together.</P>
      <P>Schools participating in the new programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Urban schools with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported where necessary through the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes and 29:1 in senior classes.</P>
      <P>Rural schools with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be allocated the services of a teacher-co-ordinator who will work in clusters of four or five schools. Rural schools that could not be clustered with other similar schools will receive financial supports as an alternative to teacher-co-ordinator support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All schools participating in the programme will also receive financial support for the delivery of targeted in-school and out-of-school actions. The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of the new programme. The school will receive supplementary grant aid of <Col N="885" /> £3,252 towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to staffing, the school in question was considered for additional teaching staff but it was deemed that it had sufficient teaching staff already to implement the maximum class size guidelines of 20:1 in junior classes and 29:1 in senior classes in respect of the current school year.</P>
    <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on the 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO. The staffing schedule for primary schools in the 2001-2002 school years has not yet been finalised. As soon as the schedule is finalised a circular will issue to all boards of management. This staffing schedule applies to all primary schools including schools participating in the new programme.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to urban schools eligible for additional teaching posts under the programme is that the allocation of new posts is subject to existing enrolment levels being maintained over the three-year period and the implementation of the maximum class sizes. The staffing allocation for these schools, including the school referred to, for the 2001-2002 school year will be based on the enrolment in the school at 30 September 2000 and will be examined in the context of any changes to the staffing schedule for national schools.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a second level <Col N="886" /> school in Ratoath is currently being examined by my Department in light of development proposals for the area and the capacity of existing schools, particularly in Dunshaughlin and Ashbourne, to meet the demand for pupil places. Consultations are ongoing between my Department's planning section and post primary school providers serving the area. When the views of all relevant parties are obtained and considered, a decision will be made on the most appropriate means by which the post primary needs of the area should be met.</P>

      <P>My Department will grant restricted recognition to certain teachers who have a recognised primary teaching qualification from another jurisdiction. These are teachers who are qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to pupils aged four to 12 years and who are not qualified to teach in mainstream national schools because they do not have an appropriate Irish language qualification.</P>
      <P>Restricted recognition as a primary teacher gives eligibility to teach in certain categories of special schools and in the categories of special classes in mainstream schools where Irish is not a curricular requirement. In addition such teachers are also entitled to take up positions in special schools for young offenders and in youth encounter projects or special education projects.</P>
      <P>Applicants must, in particular, be able to produce certified evidence of qualified teacher status from the State Board of Education or Teacher Registration Council in the jurisdiction in which teacher training was undertaken. On receipt of the necessary support documentation, my Department individually assesses applications.</P>
      <P>I should add that teachers trained in EU countries may be granted provisional recognition to teach in primary schools pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. Such teachers are allowed five years from the date of their first appointment in a primary school to obtain this competence.</P>
      <P>In order to be granted restricted or provisional recognition qualified teachers should make application to Primary Administration Section 1, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath. It is not clear from the details supplied by the Deputy whether the person in question has qualified teaching status in the United Kingdom. In the circumstances it is suggested that this person should contact primary administration with a view to submitting appropriate documentation so that this matter can be considered in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 to 441, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the national development plan in 1999, the Department of Finance which has overall responsibility for the NDP and community support framework, led the negotiations with regard to the development of the CSF and chaired the inaugural meeting of the NDP-CSF monitoring committee meeting. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in its capacity as managing authority for both the employment and human resources development operational programme and the productive sector operational programme, led the negotiations on these operational programmes and chaired the respective monitoring committee meetings. This Department, as an implementing Department, participated in these meetings, as appropriate. With regard to the senior EU officials responsible for the Irish community support framework and the operational programmes, this information is being supplied by the Departments of Finance, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment in response to their respective parliamentary questions on this matter.</P>
      <P>With reference to the Deputy's request for the precise number of projects, with respective costings and implementation plans in the education sector, the NDP has allocations of £1.893 billion and £3.478 billion, for capital and current programmes respectively. Given the scale of the activities, both capital and current, within my Department, it would require an inordinate amount of official time to answer the Deputy's questions in the detail requested. However, if the Deputy has any queries regarding a specific project or programme, I will be happy to forward the information to him.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of officials engaged in my Department on the NDP, there is a dedicated NDP-structural funds unit engaged in this process. This unit currently has a staffing allocation of five full-time, two part-time and a job-sharing official, comprising a part-time principal officer, with additional responsibilities, other than NDP-CSF, a full-time assistant principal officer, a part-time assistant principal officer, with additional responsibilities, other than NDP-CSF, two full-time and one job-sharing higher executive officer, two full-time executive officers and a full-time clerical officer. However, due to the wide range of education programmes in the NDP, crossing all sectors of the education system, there are 15 additional sections in my Department engaged in the process of delivering these programmes. Over the life of the NDP, it is anticipated that there will be up to 4,300 statutory and non-statutory centres, for example, schools, vocational education committees, institutes of technology, the Higher Education Authority, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, and the education sector, involved in the delivery of NDP measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has identified three projects that are regarded as suitable for public-private partnership procurement. They are the Cork School of Music; five new post-primary schools which are grouped into a single project; and the National Maritime College, Ringaskiddy, Cork. The Cork School of Music and the post-primary schools projects are at an advanced stage with private sector bids received on 2 February. The design, construction, financing, legal and service requirements of the bids are currently being evaluated by the project boards and it is not possible to give the capital costs at this stage. I expect to announce a preferred bidder for both projects shortly. The post-primary schools are located in: Ballincollig, County Cork, Clones, County Monaghan, Dunmanway, County Cork, Shannon, County Clare and Tubbercurry, County Sligo.</P>
      <P>Following a Government decision in May 2000, approval was given for the establishment of a National Maritime College in Ringaskiddy, County Cork using the public private partnership model and planning for the provision of the college is well under way in my Department.</P>
      <P>Following an advertisement in the Official Journal of the European Communities and in the national media, management consultants were recently appointed to support my Department's public private partnership unit with the procurement of the project. In parallel with the process of appointing management consultants, an application for outline planning permission for the new college was submitted by the Cork Institute of Technology to Cork County Council in September 2000. An interdepartmental expert working group estimated the capital cost of the project at approximately £27 million &ndash; 1999 prices &ndash; and this will be reviewed as the process develops.</P>
      <P>All of the above projects are being developed on a design, build, finance and operate basis. In the PPP process, while the maintenance and operation of the buildings will be a matter for the successful bidder for the duration of the service contract, normally around 25 years, the management of all three facilities and their day to day running will remain with the existing management authorities.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some schools have paid for private psychological assessments in areas where an educational psychologist has not yet been appointed. Unfortunately, at present, my Department is unable to reimburse schools for payments made in the past for private assessments.</P>
      <P>However, my Department is committed to the eventual provision of free psychological support for all school children who need it. At my request, the National Educational Psychological Service Agency has been examining a number of measures that will assist in meeting the current demand for psychological assessments. I hope that progress can be made through these measures in the near future.</P>

      <P>For examinations to be held in the year 2001, students who are covered by the medical services card scheme either directly or as the dependants of medical card holders are not liable to pay examination fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services, in the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, under a grant scheme introduced in 1992 under the terms of the PESP agreement.</P>
      <P>The PESP grant is paid as an addition to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita </i>grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives schools discretion as to the manner in which caretaking services are to be provided. Caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed. The question of the application of the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is not, therefore, a matter for my Department.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the school services support fund is a significant contribution towards enabling schools to meet their commitments. Under the fund, schools now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year. Provision for caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund.</P>

      <P>The issue to which the Deputy refers has been brought to my Department's attention.</P>
      <P>My Department supports the establishment of pre-school facilities for Traveller children where the need for such a service has been identified and where a suitable management structure is in place. In such situations, my Department funds 98% of the teacher salaries involved and funds the cost of transporting the children to the pre-schools. Annual funding is also provided for materials and equipment.</P>
      <P>Pre-schools for Travellers are subject to the requirements of the Child Care Act, 1991 which requires that a second adult must be within the confines of the school during its operation. In the case referred to by the Deputy, I understand that the presence of the two FÁS workers in addition to the class teachers, ensured that the pre-schools complied with this requirement.</P>
